***NÃMARÛPAVAVATTHÃNA*** DETERMINATION OF ***NÃMA*** AND ***RÛPA***

When the meditator has clearly discerned the *rûpa* phenomena in his conscious-ness, so would the *nâma* phenomena be.  In such a discernment of the *nâma* factors, there are three ways: 

1. The method of concentration starting with *phassa* (contact), 
1. The method of concentration starting with *vedanâ* (suffering), 
1. The method of concentration starting with  consciousness *viññâņa* (perception).

If the meditator concentrated on the *nâma dhamma*s via one of these three ways, then *vedanâ-saññâ-sañkhâra-viññâņa*, referred to as the four-fold *nâmakhandhâ*, are recog-nized as the ***nâmadhamma*s** which** will be acquired in his conscious mind.  *Mahâbhûta* = the four great elements and all the *upâdârûpa*s which take the four great elements as their object, are recognized as ***rûpa dhamma***s.  In this way the 18 elements, 12-fold *âyatana*s, the five-fold *khandhâ*s and all those factors in the three planes of existence = these innumerable *rûpa*- *nâma dhamma*s have been definitely and clearly defined.  It comes to the realization that there are just the *nâma* and *rûpa* in the three planes of life, above which there exist no higher ***individuality-sentient being-life-self-human-devâ-byahmâ***  

(*Visuddhi-*2: 227 - 228). 

According to the above instruction, when one is able to discern both *rûpa*+*nâma* at every thought along the path of cittaniyâma, then these *rûpa* + *nâma* are taken as object of concentration to discern that in these there are **no** **“individuality-sentient  being-life-self-human-*deva*-*byahmâ***, but **just the *rûpa* + *nâma***. 

The determination is made of the *rûpa*+*nâma* as explained above.  (When one has acquired the ability to extend his consciousness to *bhahiddha* and collectively meditate on the *bhahiddha rûpa*+*nâma* in the 31 planes, then one would clearly realize the non- 

existence of human-*devâ*-*byahmâ*). 

**An Invaluable Resolution** 

The Venerable Sayâdaw Mathera, referred to respectfully by the *desanâ* as  **Ãcariyadhammapâla**, has made an invaluable resolution in the domain of meditation in his Mahâtîkâ with respect to the above opening commentary.

The commentator in the above Visuddhimagga commentary has explained as: *Sabbepi tebhûmake dhamme nâmañca rûpañcâti dvedhâ vavatthapeti =* *tebhûmaka*s, within the three planes of life referred to as all of the *kâma-rûpa-arûpa*, are recognized as *rûpa dhamma*s as well as *nâma dhamma*s (mental factors, material factors) as two  

distinct groups.*  

`           `Here, the word *sabba* = completeness = all is meant to include the entire *dhamma*s of the *sañkhâra* phenomena.  *Nâma* and *rûpa*, however, are taken to be far apart from one another.  (They are not the associated *sampayutta dhamma*s, but are dissociated *vippayutta dhamma*s).  Therefore, the *nâma* and *rûpa dhamma*s should not be analyzed  

together as a composite group,  but be recognized as two distinct groups, and are to be  

taken as given below: 

1. The *dhamma*s that are of the nature of being attracted towards the object are *nâma*, 
1. The *dhamma*s that are subject to change are the *rûpa*. 

Only when so recognized can the non-existence of a certain *dhamma* (such as the living being, soul, *viññân*.*a* , self) of the *tebhûmaka dhamma*s present in the three planes of life and being free from both *nâma* and *rûpa* — the entire *tebhûmaka dhamma*s of the three 

planes of life are recognized as two distinct *nâma* and *rûpa dhammas*.  And this is what the commentator has stressed in his explanation.  

The expression “*Nâmañca rûpañca*” = *nâmadhamma* and *rûpadhamma* is an adequate indication that the *nâma* and *rûpa* are two distinct words, yet they are further expressed as *dvedhâ vavatthapeti* = recognized as two distinct groups.  It was expressed  

3 

so to vindicate the non-existence of a certain *dhamma* (such as the living being, soul, *viññâņa*, self) of the *tebhûmaka dhamma*s present in the three planes of life and being free from both *nâma* and *rûpa.*  

It was expounded in this way to arrive at the determination that there exist no  individual--sentient being-life-self-human-*deva*-*brahmâ* beyond the *nâmarûpa*. 

Again, it was expatiated as ***sabbepi tebhûmake dhamme*** = ***tebhûmakadhamma*** — in the word *sabba*  =  all is used for purpose of concentration on the three general  

characters *anicca*-*dukkha*-*anatta* = so as not to leave any of *sammasanupaggadhamma*. 

Indeed, the *tebhûmakadhamma* in the three planes of existence is the *dhamma* which should entirely be understood analytically; the attachment on to these *tebhûmaka*-*dhamma*s via craving should be eradicated through practice.  By practicing to eradicate the craving on these, one should acquire freedom.  That is the reason why the Buddha has admonished as follows: 

“Bhikkhus .... if the craving for the entire *rûpanâma* phenomena 

1. are not understood penetratively by *ñâtapariññâ paññâ*, 
1. are not known analytically by *tîranpariññâ*, 
1. cannot practice to eradicate and be relieved of the attachment to them by craving, then one is not worthwhile to be relieved of the sorrows of the sansâric circus. 

“Bhikkhus .... in fact, if the entire *rûpanâma* phenomena 

4. are understood penetratively by *ñâtapariññâ paññâ*, 
4. are known analytically by *tîranpariñâ*, 
4. has practiced to eradicate the attachment to them by craving, then one is worthwhile to be relieved of the sorrows of the sansâric circus (*Sam*.-2: 249 -   . 

`     `250). 

This resolution has been made in Mahâtîkâ with reference that of Aparijânanasuttana  of  Samyuttapâli Salâyatanavaggasamyutta. 

1. A statement that Nibbâna can be attained by meditating on just a single *rûpa* element, 
1. A  statement  that  Nibbâna  can  be  attained  by  meditating  on  just  a  single  *nâma* element, and 
1. A statement that Nibbâna can be attained by meditating on just a single *rûpa*   element and just a single *nâma* element. 

These  three  statements  are  definitely  the  opposite  of  the  resolution  described  in Mahâtîkâ.   He who is in search of the right dhamma, however, should not turn his back on the resolution made in Mahâtîkâ.  In fact he should obediently follow that resolution which has been made with reference the Buddha’s verbally delivered discourse. [The  

three kinds of *Pariññâpaññâ* have been explained in Bhuddekarata.]

*Lakkh*.*a* *na-rasa-paccupaţţhãna-padaţţhânavasena nâmarûpapariggaho **diţţhivisuddhi**  nâma*.  (Abhidhamm..a tthasañgaha).

***Dhâtu*** = **element** - *attano sabhâvum dhâretîti dhâtu* 

It is named *dhâtu* because it possesses its own natural character (*Visuddhi*-2:116). 

The *atta* (self), which is the thought of wrong viewers and whose way of thinking is outside the *sâsanâ*, when investigated by *paramattha* eye of wisdom, does not clearly exist.  Its  non-existence becomes  more  clearly  realized  especially  when  the *rûpa*  and *nâma*  are investigated by way of the eye of wisdom after realization of their ultimate truth.  Nothing other than *rûpa* and *nâma* is realized, nor is there the *atta*, as visualized by *ñâna*.  *Atta* is functionally *karaka* (producer); *atta* can appreciate *vedaka* (feeling).   In this way *atta* has been designated to be *karaka* and *vedaka*, but they are not to be.  It cannot function nor feel.  It is because the *atta* itself, is claimed to have functioning or  

4 

5 

feeling property, is non-existent.  

The ultimate truth, such as *cakkhu* (eye) etc., are capable of performing and  existing their own nature.  For instance 

. *Rûpâbhighâtârahabhûtappasâdalakkhanam,* 

*Dalukâmatânidânakammasamutthânabhûtappasâdalakkhanam vâ cakkhu*        

(*Visuddhi-*2: 74). 

` `Element of vision (= eye clear element), upon which impinges on the *bhûtarûpa* (mental qualities of sense-fields) = possesses nature of giving clear vision on the Four 

Great Elements.  In other words, it has the nature of giving clear vision of the Four Great Elements caused by *kamma* arising from wishing to see the material object which are  

based on *kâmatahnâ*. 

As  indicated  in  Section  on  Rûpakammatthâna,  *rûpa*  phenomena  are  made  up  of subatomic particles called *kalâpas*.  The *kalâpa* is the smallest particle of *rûpa* factors in the sphere of *rûpaparamatta*.  Element of vision too does not exist as individuality but according 

*rûpakalâ* called *cakkhudasakakalâpa*.  Included in this *cakkhudasaka kalâpa* are 10 *rûpa* phenomena.  These *rûpa dhamma*s are  the *kamma*-produced corporeality  which resulted from  *kamma*  cultivated  in  the  past  based  on  causes  *avijja-tahnâ-upâdâna*.  The  Four Mahâbhûta Elements are also included in these 10 *rûpa*s of the *cakkhudasaka kalâpa*. These Mahâbhûta Elements are the *dhamma*s on which impinges the *rûpa* objects  It is the natural character of element of vision which causes the clearness of the *mahâbhûta* factors; in every element of vision is present this natural character. Therefore, element of vision has its own nature, and performs in its own nature, and existed in the nature of its own.  Note that it also applies to other elements.  Since all these 18 *dhamma*s can exhibit the  phenomena  of the  natural characters  of their own,  they are,  therefore, 

` `nominated as “*dhâtu* = element.” 

Among these 18 elements, the element of vision etc., are by now clearly explained A slight treatment on those still not clear will be made.  First, mind element, *pañcaviññâ*- 

*dhâtu* (the five mind element) element of mental cognition will be described. 

***MANODHÃTU*  (ELEMENT OF APPRECIATION)** *Tîni manodhâtucittâni ekâ manodhâtu*. (*Visuddhi*-2: 224). 

*1.  Pañcadvârâvajjan*;  (2)  *Ahitakusalavipâkasampatcchan*;  (3)  *Ahitaakusala vipâkasampatcchan*, the three kinds of mind are called the *manodhâtu* (element of appreciation). 

*Antâdikâ manodhâtu*, *manoviññânadhâtuyâ*. 

*Pavesâpagane dvâra-pariyâyene titthti* (*Nâmarûpapariccheda*).* 

Among  the  three  *citta*  named  the  *manodhâtu*,  the  *bhavañga*  referred  to  as  the *manoviññâna*  (mind  cognition)  get  dissolved  when  *pañcadvârâvajjâna*  is  attained  and  is thought to have entered into the state of *pañcadvârâvajjâna*.  Therefore, *pañcadvârâvajjâna* is the *dvâra* (door) through which *bhvañgamanoviññâna* enters.  Again, the *manoviññâņa* called  the  *santîrana*  (investigation,  decision)  made  its  appearance  following  the *sampaticchana* (acceptance).  *Sampaticchana*, again, functions  

6 

as  the  outlet  for  *manoviññâņa*.   With  reference  to  instructions  of  this  nature,  the  three*  *manodhâtu* can be taken as the doors for the  *manoviññâņa*.   In other words, it means it  unusual appreciation. 

It is explained in the earlier pages of the section on *Nâmakamma*.*t*.*t* *hâna* etc. that 

1. Element of *bhavañgamano* clearness is the *manodvâra* (mind door), 
1. *Bhavañgamano* together with *âvajjana* (adverting mind) is the *manodvâra*, 
1. From point of view of *T*.. *thânûpacâra* (by way of place) or *phalûpacâra* (by way of contact,  the  *hadayavatthu*  (heart-based  corporeality)  is  called  the  *manodvâra*  too.  

(see pages   etc.).  Taking of *bhavañga* as the *manodvâra*, and of *bhavañga**        together with *âvajjana* as *manodvâra* is the usual way of appreciation. 

In  *pañcadvârâvajjana*  (five  door  contemplation)  and  *sampaticchânadve*  named  as *manodvâra* (mind door), *pañcadvârâvajjana*, when taken as object, is not effective as taking object of concentration following others nor as repetitively taken object of concentration, because the newly formed object in earlier stage of concentration has been taken only once.  That  is  why  the  *manodvâravajjana*  and  *sampaticchanadve*  are  —  *mano   evadhâtu manodhâtu*— referred to as the *manodhâtu* because it is an element which  

could bring about just the consciousness. 

*PAÑCAVIÑÑÂNADHÂTU* 

The *panñviññâna*s have to simply capture the object which directly appear on the receptive  corporeality.   Therefore,  the  force  of  concentration  is  more  than  that  of  the *manodhâtu*, and that is the reason why it is nominated as the *viññânadhâtu*.   It is also named 

*visesanajâtîti viññânam* = takes.  th. e object more forcefully than the *manodhâtu*.  Because it is supported by *anantara* force from the *âvajjana* (adverting mind), having different objects, 

and has to support the *sampaticchana* having different object, it used to  

be  less  forceful  than  the  *manoviññâna*  supporting  the  *viññâna*  of  similar  objects.   As instructed in Vibhañga Pâli referred to as Aññatara Abhinipâtamatta  it is just that falling  upon the respective object of the five-fold object. 

[***Anantara**—***Someone becomes successful at the expense of someone else**.  As this statement goes, two *citta*s (consciousnesses) cannot come about simultaneously, but one after another.  (The earlier consciousnesses disappear after facilitating the appearance of the later).  The  early  *citta*s  arose  and,  after  facilitating  the  rising  of  the  later, perish  away.   Before dissolution of the former, the later *citta*s have no chance to arise.  Remember that an old president would relieve himself only after handing over his duties to the new one.  The support of the former *citta* for the appearance of the next one is called *anantarapaccaya*.] 

THE *MANOVIÑÑÂDHÃTU* 

Literally *mano* (mind) refers to “knowledge”, and so also the *manoviññâna* (mental consciousness) to “special knowledge.”  The combination of the two explicitly gives the essence of a “wide knowledge, a very high knowledge and very high and wide knowledge.”  The way the realization is acquired by the very high and wide knowledge is  

7 

this.  Unlike the *citta*s described above, it does not take the new object at very early state (even though the capture has to be made in a way similar to *manodvâravajjana*), supported by  anantara  force  of  the  citta  having  similar  object,  supports  the  later  citta  of  the  same material object by  force of  *anantara* support.  Hence the capture on  the object is very effective.  Therefore, it is a nominated, from *manoviññânadhâtu* point of view, as  

*mano* with *viññânam* (see Compendium of Buddhist Philosophy, p.182). 

THE 12 *ÃYATANA*S 

Inner Six *Ãyatana*s  Outer Six *Ãyatana*s 

1. *Cakkhâyatana*  (The Eye Base)  1*.  Rûpâyatana* (Visible Object Base)

1. *Manâyatana* (Mind Base Sense)  6.  *Dhammâyatana* (Mental Object Base) 
1. The eye clearness element  = the visual sensitivity is called *cakkhâyatana*. 
1. The ear clearness element  = the sound sensitivity is called *sotâyatana*. 
1. The nose clearness sensitivity   = the nasal sensitivity is called *ghânâyatana*.  
1. The tongue clearness sensitivity  = the taste sensitivity is called *jâyatana*. 
1. The tactile clearness sensitivity  = the tangible sensitivity is called *pholabbâyatana*. 
1. The seven *lokî* cognition elements are the *manâyatana*. 

[*Lokiya satta* *viññânadhâtuyo* “*manâyatanan*”*ti.*] (Visuddhi 2:224). 

1. *Rûpârammana* (visible object) is the *rûpâyatana* (visible object base). 

   2. *Saddârammana* (sound object) is the *saddâyatana* (sound base). 
1. *Gandhâramman* (scent object) is the *gandhâyatana* (smell/scent base). 
1. *Rasârammana* (taste object) is the *rasâyatana* (taste base). 
1. *Pholabbârammana* (tactile object) is the *pholabbâyatana* (tangible base) 
1. The 52 *cetasika* (mental concomitants) and 16 *sukhumarûpa* (subtle material forms)      are all *dhammâyatana* (mental base). 

NOMINATION AS *ÃYATANA* 

*Visesato pana âyatanato, âyânam tananato, âyatassa ca **nayanato** **âyatanam**ti Veditabbam* (*Visuddhi*-2: 112). 

It is so named  

1. Because of the functions performed by each and every *citta cetasika* (mind and mental concomitants) on their own. 
1. Because  of  the  capability  of  *âya*  (lengthening)  the  stretched  mind  and  mental concomitants due to exerting effort by each and every one of them. 
1. Because of bearing full suffering of the rounds of rebirth along the *sansâric* circus. 

8 

1. ***Ãyatana***.  It means *âya* (cause) according to the meaning of the terms.  If there is no eye sensitivity and visible object, there can be no *cakkhudvârikavîthicitta* (mind door thought process).  If there are no *cakkhudvârikavîthicitta*, each and every mind and men-tal  concomitant,  appearing  every  *cittakhana*  (thought  moment)  within,  these cannot  per-form  their  respective  functions.  Thus,  the  *cakkhupasâda*  and *rûpârammana*  are  the  causes  for  *cakkhudvâravîthicitta*  and  of  carrying  out  the respective functions by the *cakkhudvârika nâma dhammas* (mental phenomena arising through the eye door).  This is the reason why the name *cakkhâyatana* — *rûpâyatana* is given.  Note that the same applies to the remaining *âyatana* pairs. 
1. Only when there are *cakkhudvâra* (eye door) and *rûpâyamana* (physical object), can there be *nâma dhamma*s (mental factors).  Without these there be no *cakkhu*-*dvâra nâma dhamma*s.  Note that it is also true for *sotadvâra saddârammana* etc.  Each mind and mental concomitant appearing with reference to the corresponding *dvâras* (doors) are stretched by the *âyatana*s.  Like a photographic enlarger which enlarges the small photographs, the *âyatana*s enlarge the mind and mental conco-mitants.  If any one (*ayonisomarikâra* = one having unwise attention) comes across a pleasant sound and agreeable beauty, he would exaggerate on what he has just encountered.  But he comes across a disagreeable sound or a feature, he would exaggerate on what he has seen with a wry face.  He would be smiling within himself and reflecting in his mind of minds. He would be reminiscing on it. This a kind of enlarging the mind mental concomitant.  In the life-continuum of a good man of a *yonisomanasikâra* (= one having wise attention) the *akusala dham-ma*s (unmeritorious deeds) do not get enlarged on the basis of these *dvârâ-rammana*s.  The mind and mental concomitants associated  with  the  insight  know-ledge,  such  as  *aniccanupassanâñana*, *dukkhanupassanâñana*,  *anattaanupassanâ-ñana*  etc.,  however  become  enlarged.  Such a kind of enlargement leads one to the nibbâna, and is worth culturing. 
1. In the infinite rounds of rebirth (*sansâra*), with no beginning, the long suffering of *sansâravatta* (sansâric function) has not yet ceased with non-reappearing cessation, the *anupâdanirodha*.  As long as they remain, these *âyatana*s would be bearing the full-fledged suffering of the sansâric circus.  And hence, they are 

`      `referred to as the *âyatana*s (Visuddhi. 2:112). 

*Manâyatana — Dhammâyatana* Mind based sense — Mental object base 

*Dvârammana bhedena, bhavañtâyatanani ca, dvârammana taduppanna, pariyâyena  dhâtuyo* (*Abhidhammattasañgaha*) 

. 

*Attano sebhâvum dhâretîti dhammo* = because they their own specific characters, they are named the *dhamma*.  This being so, since all the *paramattha dhamma*s bear their own specific characters (= the characters), they should be taken as a single “*dhammâ-yatana*.”   A question would then arise as to why it is expatiated as 12  *âyatana*s  but  

treating each separately.  The answer follows. 

This *âyatana desana* is exhorted to clearly differentiate the doors and object of  9 

the six kinds of *viññânakâya* (tactile cognition).  Since there are six *dvâra*s and six *âram- mana* *âyatanas*, it was expounded as 12 *âyatana*s instead of a single *dhammâyatana*. 

1. The door, at which all the *viññâna* (cognition) included in the *cakkhuviññânavîthi* (eye consciousness process), is just the *cakkhâyatana*, and the *rûpârammana* (visible object) is the only object domain. 
1. The door, at which all the *viññâna* (cognition) included in the *sotaviññânavîthi* (ear consciousness process), is just the *sotâyatana*, and *saddârammana* (acoustic object) is the only object domain. 
1. The door, at which all  the *viññâna* (cognition) included in the *ghânaviññânavîthi* (nose consciousness process), is just the *gandhârammana* (olfactory object) is the only object domain. 
1. The  door,  at  which  all  the  *viññâna*  (cognition)  included  in  the  *jivhâviññânavîthi* (tongue consciousness process), is just the *rasârammana* (taste object) is the only object domain. 
1. The door, at which all the *viññâna* (cognition) included in the *kâyaviññânavîthi* (body consciousness process), is just the *phothabbârammana* (tactile object) is the

6. The door is the plane where all the *viññâna*s* (cognition), which are included in the *manoviññânavîthi*, arise and part of the *âyatana* referred to as *bhavañgacitta*  

`      `arising after being vibrated twice. 

(This is a translation with reference to Mahâtîkâ.  According to speeches made by successive generations of teachers, the plane of formation of all the *viññânas*, included in the *manoviññânavîthi*, is just a part of the *âyatana* referred to as *bhavañgacitta* arising after vibrating twice.  According to the Subcommentary (Tîkâ), the *bhavañgaclana* (vibration of life-continuum),  which  arises  after  vibrating  twice,  is  the  *manodvâra*.   Generations  of teachers  have  said  that  the  vibrating  *bhavañga*  =  vibration  of  life-continuum  =  arising completely later = *bhavañgupaccheda* (cessation of life-continuum)  The only difference is the usage of *bhavañgacalana* and *bhavañgupaccheda*.  In essence, however, note that the main *desanâ* is the same.  The vibrating *bhavañga* = *bhavañga*-*calana* by the power of which the *bhavañga* distinctly arises, and *âvajjana* can only arise when *bhavañga* arises.  *Ãvajjana* will not arise when the *bhavañgacalana* does not arise.  With *bhavañga* as the cause of *âvajjana* in mind, the commentator has explained that *bhavañgacalana* (= *bhavñgupaccheda*) referred to as *bhavañgamana*, which is a part of *âyatana*, is the plane of *dvâra* where all the *viññâna* included in the *manoviññânavîthi* are  

10 

formed.) 

***Ekadesayûpaca** - Lokiyasattaviññânadhâtu manâyatanam* (*Visuddhi* 2: 224). 

It has been explained that all the seven *lokiviññâdhâtu*, i.e., all the *lokîcitta* (the object of  insight  knowledge)  are  *manâyatana*.   Note  that  *bhavañga*  *citta*,  which  is  a  part  of *manâyatana*, is taken by way of *ekadesayñpacâya* as *manâyatana*, and again this  *bhavañgamanâyatana* as the *manodvâra* the support of all *manoviññâna*. 

***Dhammâyatana —** Tasampayuttâ phassâdayo sesarûpañca* “*dhammâyatanan*”*ti* (*Visud*- *dhi* 2: 224). 

All *âyatana*s, except the *lokîviññânadhâtu* and *phassa* etc. of 25 mind and mental concomitants  occurring  in  each  *cittakhana*  and  *cakkhâyatana*  etc.  of  the  above  10 *rûpâ*- *yatana*, the remaining 16 *sukhumarûpa*s are the *dhammâyatana*s.  These *dhammâyatana*s  

are not associated either as *dvâra* or object with *cakkhuviññâna* etc. of the *pañcaviññâna*. 

Another way of taking *Manodvâra*.  “*Ayam nâma mano manâdvâram na hotî*”*ti (Abhi.  Tha.* 1: 129). 

According to this commentary, the early *mana* (= mind) is beneficial to the later *mana* (mind).  Therefore, all the early *mana* can be taken as the causative *dvâra* of the later ones.  With reference to this commentary all the *citta* called *manâyatana* are *mano*-*dvâra*.  Taking only the *bhavañga* as the *manodvâra* is routine way.  Note that all the *citta* as *manodvâra* is by way of *pariyâya*. (A kind of *pariyâya* refers to the *anantara*, the  

proximate cause). 

***Dhammâyatana  also  is  a  pariyâya***.   *Rûpâyatana*  etc.  are  usually  (customarily) referred  to  as  *rûpâyatana*.   *Dhammâyatana*  and  *dhammâramana*,  however,  are  slightly different.  As mentioned under *Dhammâyatana* (see earlier pages of this vol.),  *pasâda-rûpa* (clear  sensitivity),  *sukhumarûpa*  (subtle  forms),  mind,  mental  concomitant,  nibbâna  and *paññatti* (concept) are included in the phenomena called *dhammârammana*.  Exhorta- tion has been made to selectively include the object of insight knowledge in the *dhammâ*-*yatana*.  But nibbâna and *paññatti* cannot be included.  The five clear sensitivity, which have been specially  designated  as  *cakkhâyatana*  etc.,  cannot  be  included  in  the  *dhammâ*-*yatana.*  Because all the *lokicitta*s have been given a special name *manâyatana*, they are not included in  the  *dhammâyatana*.   Therefore,  it  must  be  noted  that  designating  *dham*-*mâyatana*  as *dhammârammana* — the six *dvârayatana*, the six *ârammanâyatana* — differentiating 12 *âyatana*s is because of a kind of *pariyâya* (conditioned cause). (The *âyatana desanâ* was expounded for *rûpasammûlâ* and *majjimarûci* individuals.  See  

section on *Rûpakammatthâna*). 

[**Special Note**.  Among the 16 subtle forms named *dhammâyata* is also included the very  important  *hadayavatthurûpa*  (heart-based  corporeality,  which  also  is  the  *dham*- *mâyatana*.  This is a factor very important in concentrating on the 12 *âyatana* objects and  

the 18 element objects.] 

Again, the six doors, the six objects and the six concepts, developed dependent upon the six objects of concentration, together come to 18 in all — the six each of the doors, the objects and the concepts.  It should be noted that, as described in  

11 

*dhammâyatana*, the *dhammadhâtu* is called *dhammârammana*. 

CULTURING *RÛPA* — *NÂMA* BY WAY OF 18 ELEMENTS 

In section on *Rûpakammatthâna*, the *cakkhudvâra* = 54 kinds of visual sense (the  eye), the true *rûpa*s have been described in tables.  Among these 54 

1) 1.  Clear sensitivity is the visual element, but the remaining 53 are not. 
2. *Rûpârammana* (visible object base) is the *rûpa* element. 
2. Depending on the *cakkhudhâtu*, and taking the *rûpadhâtu* as the object, there 

arises the mind which is the *cakkhuvññânadhâtu*. 

2) 1.   *Sotapasâda*  (clear  sensitivity  of  ear)  is  the  *sotadhâtu*  (sound  element),  but  the   remaining 53 are not. 
2. *Saddârammana* is the *saddâdhâtu* 
2. The *citta* (mind) which arises depending on and taking *saddahâtu* as the object, is  the *sotaviññânadhâtu*. 
3) 1.  *Ghânâpasâda* (nose clear sensitivity) is the *gânadhâtu* (the scent element), but the remaining 53 are not. 
2. *Gandârammana* is the *gandadhâtu*. 
2. The  *citta*  (mind)  which  arises  depending  on  *ghânadhâtu*  and  taking  the *gandârammana* as the object, is  the *ghânaviññânadhâtu*. 
4) 1.  *Jivhâpasâda* (tongue clear sensitivity) is the *jivâdhâtu* (the scent element), but the remaining 53 are not. 
2. *Rasârammana* (*taste object)* is the *rasadhâtu*. 
2. The *citta* (mind) which arises depending on *jivhâdhâtu* and taking *jivhârammana*  as the object, is  the *jivhâviññânadhâtu*. 
5) 1.  *Kâyapasâda* (clear sensitivity of body) is the *kâyadhâtu* (the body element), but the remaining 53 are not. 
2. *Pholabbârammana* (*tactile object)* is the *pholabbadhâtu* (tangible element). 
2. The *citta* (mind) which arises depending on *kâyadhâtu* and taking *pholabba*  as the object, is  the *kâyaviññânadhâtu.* 
6) 1.  *Pañcadvâvajjana* - *sampatichannadve* is the *manodhâtu*.  
2. The 52 *cetasika* (mental concomitants) and 16 *sukhumarûpa* (subtle material forms) are the *dhammadhâtu*. 
2. The *citta* (mind) which arises depending *manodhâtu* and taking *dhammadhâtu*  as  

`           `the object, is  the *manoviññânadhâtu*. 

[Note.  As a good man the *manoviññânadhâtu*, which can acquired at a *tihita* (3-rooted condition) worldling stage, in your life-continuum are of the following kinds: 

1. *Akusalacitta* (karmically unwholesome consciousness)   12 
1. *Santîranacitta* (investigating consciousness)   3 
1. *Manodvâravajjana*   (advertence)     1 
1. *Mahâkusalacitta* (great, wholesome consciousness)   8 
5. *Mahâvipâkacitta* (result of great deed)               8 
5. *Rûpâvacarajana* (*kusala*) (fine material sphere consciousness)   4 (*catukka* method) They all come to a total of 36 kinds. 

12 

If raised to *rûpâvacara* (world of forms) by way of *pañcaka* (five-fold), there will be 37 kinds of *viññânadhatu* (consciousness element).  If all the eight *samâpatti* (sus- 

tained deep mental absorption) have been acquired, there will be 40 or 41 *viññânadhâtu*.] 

In this way the various  *dhâtu*  (elements)  are discerned to attain the visual  knowledge of their ultimate truth: 

1. *Cakkhudhâtu, rûpadhâtu, cakkhuviññânadhâtu ,* 
1. *Sotadhâtu, saddadhâtu, sotaviññânadhâtu,*  
1. *Ghânadhâtu, gandhadhâtu, ghânaviññânadhâtu ,* 
1. *Jivhâdhâtu, rasadhâtu, jivhâviññânadhâtu,*  
1. *Kâyadhâtu, pholabbadhâtu, kâyaviññânadhâtu,*  
1. *Manodhâtu, dhammadhâtu, manoviññânadhâtu*.  (Note that it is not citation        *kammatthâna*). 

DISCERN THE *RÛPA* - *NÂMA* 

When  you  are  able  to  concentrate  on  and  take  up  the  rûpa  and  nâma  by  your 

knowledge as 

1. *Cakkhudhâtu,  rûpadhâtu,  sotadhâtu,  saddâdhâtu,  ghânadhâtu,  gandhadhâtu, jivhâdhâtu,* the 16 *sukhumarûpa* (a part of *dhammadhâtu*), called the *dhammadhâtu*, are the *rûpadhamma*s.  
1. *Cakkhuviññânadhâtu, sotaviññânadhâtu* -------------- *manoviññânadhâtu,* the (52) mind and mental concomitants, called the *dhammadhâtu*s, are the *nâma-* 

`         `*dhamma*. 

In this way take up and discern the *rûpa* and *nâma dhamma*s (*Visuddhi* 2: 224). 

DISCERNING *RÛPA - NÂMA* BY WAY OF 12 *ÃYATANA*S 

`  `A   1.  *Cakkhupasâda* is the *cakhâyatana*.  

\2.  *Rûpârammana* is the *rûpâyatana.* 

`  `B   1.  *Sotapasâda* is the *sotâyatana*. 

\2.  *Saddârammana* is the *saddâyatana*. 

C.  1.  *Ghanapasâda* is the *ghânâyatana*. 

\2.  *Gadhâyatana* is the *gandhâyatana*. 

4. 1.  *Jivhârammmana* is the *jivhâyatana*. 

\2.  *Rasârammana* is the *rasâyatana*. 

5. 1.  *Kâyapasâda* is the *kâyâyatana*. 

\2.  *Pholabbâyatana* is the *pholabbâyatana*. 

6. 1.  The seven *lokâviññâdhâtu* is the *manâyatana*. 

\2.  the 52 mind and mental concomitants, the *dhammârammana* called the 16 subtle   

`            `material forms are  the *dhammâyatana*. 

13 

The  *cakkhâyatana-rñpâyatana,*  the  *sotâyatana-saddâyatana,*  the  *ghânâyatana- gandhâyatana,*  the  *jivhâyatana-rasâyatana,*  the  *kâyâyatana-pholabbâyatana,*  the *dhammâyatana*, called the* 16 subtle material forms, are all ***rûpadhamma***. 

The *manâyatana* and *dhammâyatan* (called the 52 *cetasika*) are all ***nâmadham-*** 

***ma***. 

In this way concentrate on the *rûpa-nâma* and discern the *rûpa-nâma* (*Visuddhi* 2: 224 - 225). 

Here too it is important that the *kammatthâna* is not a citation.  One has to understand that the instruction is made to concentrate on these *âyatana*s as object to attain the ultimate truth via perfect knowledge (insight knowledge).  The method is to combine the 18 *dhâtu*s and the 12 *âyatana*s and to discern on the sum total of these.  The discernment analytically of these into finer details is given in Mûlapannasa Commentary as follows.  They are the ways of discerning the four *âyatana*s and the four *dhâtu*s that arise at every *vîthicittakhana* (mental process moment) along the course of *cittaniyâma* (mental certainty). 

`           `**A WAY OF DISCERNING *DHÂTU* — *ÂYATANA*** 

*Tatthâ cakkhu cakkhâyatanam, rûpam rûpâyatanam, dassanam manâyatana vedanâdayo sampayuttadhammâ dhammâyatanam.  Evametesam catunnam âyatanânam samavâye âlokanavilokanam paññâyati.

Evametâsam cakkhunnam dhâtunam samavâye âlokanavikkanam*  

*paññâyati.  Tatthako eko âloketi, ko viloketi* (*Ma-Ttha.* 1: 268). 

If the following four  *âyatana*s  happen to come together there occurs the state of  looking straight and looking askance. 

1. Eye clear element is the eye base* 
1. Visible object is the visible object base 
1. Visualizing visual concept is the mind base 
1. The associated mind and mental concomitant *sampayutta dhamma* groups, such as *phassa-vedanâ-saññâ-cetanâ-ekaggatâ-jîvita-manasikâra*,  are  the  *dhammâ-yatana* (mental object base). 

Now who would see this way?  Which living being would look straight forward or askance?  (It means there is neither straight forward looking nor looking askance ones).   

A similarly situation holds true for the following. 

1. *Cakkhupasâda* (the eye sensitivity) is the *cakkhudhâtu* (the element of vision) 
1. *Rûpârammana* (the visible object base)* is the *rûpadhâtu* (the mental element)*.* 
1. Realizing *cakkhuviññâna* (the eye consciousness) is the *cakkhuviññânadhâtu* (the eye consciousness element). 
1. The  associated  mental  concomitants,  such  as  *phassa*  etc.,  the  *phassasampayutta*- *dhamma* (associated tangible factors) are *dhammadhâtu* (mind element). 

(*Ma.Ttha*.1: 261). 

14 

The opening of these documentaries explained in such a way that the manifes- tations become vividly materialized using the *upalakkhanâ* and *nidassana* methods. 

Now you good man, discern the *nâmakammatthâna* tables again.  Pay attention to them as the object of concentration.  Pay attention on the corporeality and mentality once again.  In the above commentary it is explained that the four *âyatana*s and the four *dhâtu*s are realized as the  *rûpârammana*  at the instance of the  *cittaviññâna*  (mental  

consciousness) *cittakkhana* (thought moment). 

The  mental  consciousness cannot  arise  without *pañcadvâravajjana*  (apprehension through the five sense doors) arising before it.  If it is the *cakkhuviññâna* (eye consciousness), a  series  of  thought  processes  do  not  halt  during  the  interval  of  *cakkhuviññâna*,  or  of *sampaticchana*,  nor  *santîrana*.   It  will  continue  at  least  up  to  *vuttho*  (determining consciousness).  Even then, the *ârammana* has to be weak *parittârammana* for it to halt the mental  processes  and  come  to  a  *bhavañga*  (rapt.).   If  the  *ârammana*  (the  object)  is  the *mahantarâramma*, it is usual to continue up to the attainment of *jo* (impulsion), if *atirâm mana* up to *tadârammana* (registering). 

Therefore at a consciousness moment of *cakkhuviññâna*, the four *âyatana*s and the four *dhâtu*s are formed, so also at the *pañcadvâravajjana, sampticchana, santîrana*, *uttho, tadârammana* etc., there are four *âyatana*s and four *dhâtu*s respectively.  A few examples will be cited here.  At each thought moment, there will be four  *âyatana*s  and  

four *dhâtu*s respectively, where — 

1. Supporting heart-based corporeality is the *dhammâyatana* (mental object). 
1. *Rûpârammana* (visible object) is the *rûpâyatana* (visible object base). 
1. *Pañcadvârâvajjana  citta*  (conscious  mind  through  the  five  sense  doors)  is  the *manâyatana* (mind-based sense). 
1. The associated mental concomitant *sampayutta* (association) groups are *dhammâ*- *yatana* (mental base). 
1. The supporting heart-based corporeality is the *dhammadhâtu.* 
1. The visible object is the *dhammadhâtu*. 
1. The *pañcadvârâvajjana citta* is the *manodhâma*. 
1. The associated mental concomitant *sampayutta* groups are *dhammadhâtu*. 

`           `However, the heart-based corporeality and associated  mental  concomitant *dhamma* groups are both the  *dhammadhâtu*.  If such similar *dhamma*s are combined, there will be three *âyatana*s and three *dhâtu*s.  Note that this hold true for the remaining thought processes  (*vîthicitta*).  Whether small or large in numbers,  all the associated mental  

concomitant *sampayutta dhamma*s are the *dhammâyatana* and *dhammadhâtu* only. 

There still remain some distinct cases.  For example, though *sampaticchana* is named *manâyatana* (the mental object base), but as an element it is *manodhâtu* (the mental element).  It is not nominated as *manoviññânadhâtu*.  Note that the remaining thought processes are *manoâyatana* as well as *manoviññânadhâtu*.  For those still with immature knowledge the *jocittakhana* (moment of consciousness impulsion) , which includes *nâmadhamma*, is given as an illustration. 

15 

In each and every *jocittakhanâ* (character of consciousness impulsion), under- stand the four *âyatana* 

1. The supporting heart-base corporeality is the *dhammâyatana* (= *dhammadhâtu*). 
1. The *rûpârammana* is the *rûpâyatana*. 
1. The *kusalajoviññâna* (meritorious consciousness impulsion) is the *manâyatana*  (= *manoviññânadhâtu*). 
1. The associated mental concomitant, the (33) association *dhamma* groups are the  

`      `*dhammâyatana* (= *dhammadhâtu*). 

In other words, if the heart-base corporeality and mental concomitant *dhamma* are combined as they have similar âtatana, there will be  three *âyatana*s and three *dhâtu*s.  In this way concentrate on the four *âyatana*s and the four *dhâtu*s at every thought process moment.  Discern on all the good and bad groups in accordance with process series.  Contemplate covering all the six lines.  Concentrate on row after row given in the *Ñâmakammattha* tables.  When one is able to also discern *patisandhe-bhavañga-cuti*,  

continue in a similar way as above. 

If  one  wants  to  discern  another  way,  after  successfully  concentrating  on  the  four *âyatan*s and the four *dhatu*s at every thought moment as mentioned above, one may culture the whole row through and through.  Lest use see the first row (good group table) of line showing the *rûpârammana* of the good group table.  Here, there are *pañcadvârâvajjana, cakkhuviññâna, sampticchana, santîrana, vuttho*, seven impulsions, two   *tadârammana* — *manodvârâvajjana*,  seven impulsions, two  *tadârâmmana*  

respectively.  The at every thought process moment, discern as given below. 

1. The  supporting  heart  base  corporeality  as  object  concentrate  as  *dhammâyatana*, *cakkhâyatana, dhammâyatana, dhammâyatana* ..... 
2. Taking rûpârammana as object concentrate as *rûpâyatana, rûpâyatana,* ..... 
3. Taking each consciousne mind as object collect as *manâyatana*, *manâyatana*. 
3. Taking the associated mental concomitant *sampayutta dhamma* groups as object,  

`       `concentrate as *dhammâyatana*, *dhammâyatana*. 

In this way collect each row four times. 

In supporting corporeality, all the *cakkhuviññâna dhamma* groups are  upon  *cak*- *khuvutthurûpa* (visual corporeality).  All the remaining thought processes arise dependent upon the heart base corporeality called the *dhammâyatana* and *dhamma-dhâtu*.  So note that in the supporting corporeality, the *dhammâyatana*s are for the remaining thought processes, and the *cakkâyatana* is for the *cakkhuviññâna*.   In con- 

tinuation, a hint on collection by the 18 *dhâtu* way will be described. 

1. Taking  the  supporting  corporeality  as  the  only  object  discern  as  *dhammadhâtu, dhammadhâtu, dhammadhâtu, dhammadhâtu* .... 
2. The *ârâmmanarûpa* only is taken as the object and discern as *rûpadhâtu, rûpa-dhâru* .... 
3. Taking  each  conscious  mind  as  the  object  discern  as  *manodhâtu,  cakkhuviññâna- dhâtu, manodhâtu, manoviññânadhâtu*. 

16 

4. The associated mental concomitant *sampayutta dhamma* groups are taken as the         object and discerned as *dhammadhâtu, dhammadhâtu* ..... 

The  above  1  -  4 belong  to  the  eye  door  thought process  and  mind  door  thought 

process. 

The *pañcadvârâvajjana* and *samptaticchana*  are the *manodhâtu, cakkhuviññâna* is the *cakkhuviññâna dhâtu*, and the remaining thought processes are the *cakkhuviññâna dhâtu*.  In  contemplating  on  the  *cetasika*,  each  is  taken  with  reference  to  its  associated  *cetasika* arising at each thought moment, and collectively taken as the *dhammâyatana* or  

the *dhammadhâtu*. 

Collect all the bad and good groups in each row in the line showing *rûpârammana*.  Discern in the *saddârammana*, etc. in a similar way.  In this method the discernment on  

both *âyatana* and *dhâtu* phenomena are the same. 

Reside singly in *arañña* (in the forest), *rukkhâmûla* (under a tree), *suññâgâra* (in a quiet place) happily, as the Lord has instructed.  With the mind set at the nibbâna with *appamâdadhamma*  (mindfulness) called the vigilance on the object  *rûpanâmadhamma  sañkhâra*, a vigorous concentration is to be made with unyielding zest and zeal. 

Now  collection  of  the  five-fold  corporeality  will  be  described.   To  begin  with, *khandhâ* (corporeality) and *upâdânakkhandhâ* (the five clinging aggregate) will be presented. **EXTRACTS FROM KHANDHÂ-SUTTANA**

Bhikkhus .... I shall now admonish to you as regard five-fold corporeality and  the  five-fold clinging aggregate.  Now you all listen. 

Bhikkhus .... What are the five-fold corporeality?  Bhikkhus .... There are such *dhamma*s as 

1. The *rûpa* dhamma (corporeality phenomena) of the past, future and present, all those that are internal and external, all those that are coarse and subtle, all those that are low and lofty, all those that are far (from the consciousness of the meditator) and near (close to the consciousness of the meditator).  All these (11) categories of material forms are the *rûpakkhandhâ* (the aggregate of the matter or of corporeality). 
1. R.   All  the  *vedanâ  dhamma*  (phenomena  of  suffering)  are  the  *vedanakkhandhâ* (aggregate of sensation or feeling group). 
1. R.  All the *saññâ dhamma* (phenomena of perception) are the *saññakkhandhâ* (the aggregate of mental formation or perception group). 
1. R.  all the *cetasika sankhâra dhamma* (mental formation phenomena) are *sankhâ- ranakkhandhâ* (aggregate of mental formation). 
5. All the *viññâna dhamma* (consciousness factor) of the past, future and present, all those that are internal and external, all those that are coarse and subtle, all those that are low and lofty, all those that are far and near.  All these (11) categories of   

`      `are the *viññâna dhamma*. are *viññânakkhandhâ*  (the aggregate of consciousness).   

Bhikkhus .... These are the five-fold *khandhâ*s 

(*Sam*. 2: 39; *Khandhâsuttana*). 

Bhikkhus .... What are the five-fold *upâdânakkhandhâ*? There are such *dhamma*s as 

6. 1.  All the *rûpa* phenomena of the past, future and the present, to which are attached as “I, mine” by *tahnâ, ditthi* and which are the object of the four *âsava dhamma* (moral intoxicants), all those that are internal and external, all those that are coarse and subtle, all those that are low and lofty, all those that are far (from consciousness) and near (to consciousness).  All these physical phenomena  are  

`      `the *rûpupâdânakkhandhâ*  (the aggregate as the object of grasping), existing as     (11)  

categories, and attached as “I, mine” by means of *tahnâ, ditthi,* the object of  

`      `the four immoral intoxicants. 

2. R.  All the *vedanâ dhamma* are the *vedanupâdânakkhandhâ* (clinging to the aggregate of sensation). 
2. R.  All the *saññâ dhamma* are the *saññupâdânakkhandhâ* (clinging to the aggregate of perception). 
2. R.  All the *cetasika sañkhâra* dhammas are the *sankârupâdânakkhandhâ* (clinging to the aggregate of formation). 
2. R.  All the *viññâna dhamma* (concept phenomena) are the *viññânupâdânakkhandhâ*  

`      `(clinging to the aggregate of sensation) (*Sam*.-2:39, *Khandha-suttana*) 

***KHANDHÂ* AND *UPÂDÂNAKKHANDHÂ***  

**(THE AGGREGATES AND THE AGGREGATES AS OBJECT OF  CLINGING)** 

*Chatthe rûpakkhandho kâmâvacaro, cattâro khandhâ catubhûmakâ.*  R.  *Idhâpi rûpak- khandho kâmâvacaro, avasesâ tebhûmakâ vipassanâcâravasena vuttâ.  Evmettha rûpam râsatthena khandhesu pavittham, sasavrâsatthena upâdânakkhandhesu*.  *Vedanâdayo* 

*sâsavâpi atthi, anâsavâpi atthi*.  *Te rasatthena sabbepi khandhesu pavitthâ, tebhûmakâ  panettha sâsavatthena upâdânakkhandhesu pavitthâti* (*Sam.-Ttha.-*2: 249). 

1. In the five-fold *khandhâ*, *rûpakkhandhâ* is the *kâmâvacara* (the realms of sensual pleasures).  The *vedanâ-saññâ-sankhâra-viññâna*, called the four-fold *nâmakkhandhâ* (the mental aggregate) are the *kâma-rûpa-arûpa-lokuttarâ* (the sensual existence-deva corporeal-formless  existence),  the  *dhamma*s  of  the  four  *bhavana*  (planes)  of existence.  The first *Khandhâdesanâ* was expounded to show that, whether in the mundane  or  supra-mundane,  all  the  *dhamma*s  that  can  be  taken  collectively  as aggregates   
1. In the *upâdânakkhandhâ,* expounded as the second *desanâ*, corporeal aggregate is the *kâmâvacara dhamma*.  *Vedanâ-saññâ-sankâra-viññâna*, the four *nâmak-khandhâ*, are those *tebhûmaka dhamma*s formed in the three planes of existence as *kâma-rûpa- arûpa*.   The  Buddha  has  to  again  expatiate  the  *upâdânakkhandhâ*  (the  clinging aggregate) as the object of *vipassanañâna* (insight knowledge)  

`       `referred to as the *vipassanacâra* (vipassanâ exercise). 

For a meditator still at the three-root plane of mundane mind and mental concomitant, called  the  *lokuttarakhandhâ*  are  the  *dhamma*  he  has  not  acquired  yet.   Therefore  the *vipassanâbhâvanâ kammatthâna*, taking the lokuttarakhandhâas the object, cannot be made by analytical knowledge.  But those who have acquired the *lokuttara* *dhamma* can.  The  *lokuttara*  mind and mental concomitant, however, the  *sañkhata*  

(results produced by specific action) *dhamma* too.  With reference to — 

*Tînimâni bhikhave sañkhatassa sañkhatalakkhanâni.  Katamâ tîni, uppâdo paññâyatti,  vayopañâyati, tthitassa aññatthattam paññâyati* (*Am.* 1: 150). 

the  *sañkhata  suttana  desanâ*,  formation-static-dissolution  =  *upâdâ-tthî-bhañga*,  there  are definitely three *sañkhata* (results produced by specific action) characters.  Because of these three, they  are also the *sañkhata* *dhamma*s.  They are the *dhamma*s dependent upon the phenomena of *anicca*, *dukkha* and *anatta* of the *sañkhata* *dhamma* — arising only when supported  by  the  forceful  object  of  *upanissaya*  property  of  insight  knowledge  called *dhammaditthi*.   Also  when  supported  by  the  force  of  *ârammana  paccaya*  (the  object condition)  of  *asañkhata  dhâtu*  (the  unconditioned  and  absolute  element)  only  can  these *dhamma*s arise.  They are the *sañkhâra dhamma*s too.  Therefore, it is true that they are  

the *anicca, dukkha* and *anatta dhamma*s. 

Although  these  *lokuttarâ  citta-cetasika*  (the  supra-mundane  mind  and  mental concomitants) are the *sañkata* and *sañkhâra dhamma*s included in the *anicca-dukkha-anatta dhamma* groups, the *magga dhamma*s (the Path factors) are those that relieve one 

` `from the suffering of the rounds of rebirth = the good *niyânika* (leading to salvation)  

18 19 

*dhamma*s.  The *phala* (Fruit) *dhamma*s are also the good causes definitely leading to  enjoyment  of  the  *santisukha*  of  the  *nibbâna*  =  the  great  peacefulness.   Therefore  the discernment on these *lokuttarâ citta* and *cetasika* by *vipassanâ* as *anicca-dukkha-anatta* are not meant to become wearied of worldly life by *nibbinda ñâna* (knowledge of tedium) But when the vipassanâ exercise is made taking as object only on the *lokî citta-cetasika*-*rûpa*, recognized as the causes for suffering of the *sansâr*ic circus, then the nature of *citta-cetasika* will vividly be understood.  Then the *nibbinda ñâna*, which become entirely tedious of the five-fold *upâdânakkhandhâ*, referred to as the suffering of the *sansâr*ic circus, will arise.  That  is  why  only  the  *lokî  khandhâ*s  (mundane  aggrgate)  taken  as  object  in   exercising *vipassanâkammatthâna*.  With a view to contemplate in this way,  

the Buddha has to admonish *upâdânakkhandhâ desanâ* solely of the *lokî khandhâ*s. 

Since the *rûpa dhamma* means aggregate, it is also included in the *khandhâ*s.   It also bears the meaning of aggregate as the object of  *âsava*  (canker, fetter)  *dhamma*s,  

hence it is included in the *upâdânakkhandhâ*s too. 

The four-fold *nâma khandhâ*s, such as *vedanâ* (feeling) etc., are the *khandhâ*s that are the object of the *âsava dhamma*s.  There are those *khandhâ*s which are not the object of the *âsava dhamma*s.   The  *lokî citta-cetasika*  included in this four-fold  *khandhâ*s  are  

the object of *âsava dhamma*s, but *lokuttarâ citta-cetasika* are not. 

Included  in  the  three  planes  of  life,  *kâma-rûpa-arûpa*,  are  the  *lokî  citta-cetasika- vedanâ-saññâ-sañkhâra-viññâna*.  These are included in *upâdânakkhandhâ* because it  

bears the meaning of being the object of *âsava dhammas*. 

The of the *lokî citta-cetasika-rûpa*  included in the three planes of life — 

1. The 28 species of *rûpa* are *rûpupâdânakkhandhâ*. 
1. *Vedanâcetasika* is the *vedanupâdânakkhandhâ*. 
1. *Saññâcetasika* is the *saññûpânakkhandhâ*. 
1. The remaining (50) *cetasika*s are all *vedanupâdhânakkhandhâ*. 

[N.B.  To make it easier, the five-fold upâdânakkhandhâ are sometimes expressed as the *rûpakkhandhâ,  vedanâ-kkhandhâ,  saññâ-kkhandhâ,  sañkhârakkhandhâ*  and  *viññânak- khandhâ*,  or  *rûpa*-*vedanâ-saññâ,  sañkhâra-viññâna*  respectively.  When  you  come  acroos such  usage,  note  that  they  all  refer  to  the  *upâdânakkhandhâ*s,  the  object  of  vipassanâ meditation.  In the *viññânakkhandhâ* is mentioned *lokîcitta*.  These *lokîcitta*s, however, refer only to those that can arise in one’s *santâna*s (life continuum).  Note also that the  

cetasika refers to those associated with the corresponding *citta*s.]  

DISCERN *NÂMA-RÛPA* SEPARATELY 

*Iti rûpakkhandho rûpam, cattâro arûpno khandhâ nâmanti evameko  pañcakkhandhavasena nâmarûpam vavatthapeti* (*Visuddhi* 2: 225). 

Discern *rûpa* and *nâma* separately as “*rûpadhamma* and *nâmadhamma* as follows 

1. *Rûpakkhandhâ* is the *rûpadhamma*. 
1. The four-fold *nâma khandhâ* is the *nâmadhamma* 

20 

This is the way the *rûpa-nâma* are discerned by method of the five-fold *khandhâ*s.  This is the way all the *rûpadhamma*s and *lokî nâma khandhâ*s are collectively  

concentrated upon. 

1. *Arûpasammûlhâ* = he who lacks clear consciousness on the *nâmadhamma*.* 
1. *Samkhittaruci* =  he who enjoys any thing concise. 
1. *Tikkhapaññâvâ* = intelligent and sharp-minded person 

With reference to the above three kinds of person, the Buddha has to expound the  vipassanâ meditation by method of *khandhâ desanâ*. 

Discerning collectively in this way can be accomplished only by sharp-minded  person.  The following meditation method is given for slow-minded persons. 

DISCERNING IN DETAIL — THE FIVE-FOLD *KHANDHÂ* METHOD 

*Ittha hi cakkhu ceva rûpañca rûpakkhandho, dassanam viññânâ-kkhandho, tam-sampayuuta vedanâ vedanâ-kkhandho, saññâ saññâ-kkhandho, phassâdikâ sañkhârakkhando*.  *Evametesam pañcannam khandhânam sammavâye âlokanavilokanam*  

*paññâyati*.  *Tattha ko eko âloketi, ko viloketi* (*Ma.-Ttha.-*1: 267 - 268). 

In the *pañcadvâravîthi* (the five-door consciousness process) at a thought moment of consciousness by way of sight, the straight visualization and visualization at a glance vividly appear when the five-fold corporeality are captured together as 

1. The eye clear element and *rûpârammana* are the *rûpakkhanda* (aggregate of matter), 
1. The  consciousness  by  way  of  sight,  having  visual  capability,  is  the  aggregate  of consciousness, 
1. The  *vedanâ*  (suffering)  associated  with  the  aggregate  of  consciousness  is  the aggregate of sensation or feeling group., 
1. The perception is the aggregate of perception, 
1. The contact etc., of the five-fold mind and mental concomitant are the aggregate  

of mental formation. 

`     `Now which individual would have straight visualization and which one has 

glancing ability? (What it means is that there is neither any individual of straight visualization nor glancing, it is only the phenomenon of the five-fold aggregate coming  

together.) 

As explained in many places above, the consciousness by way of sight cannot arise without  the  *pañcadvâravajjana*  (apprehension  through  the  five  sense  doors),  nor *sampaticchana, santirana, vuttho*, nor impulsion if it is *mahantârammana*, nor the impulsion- *tadârammana* (the then object) if it is *atimahntârammana*.  Because of this, the five-fold aggregate as the object of concentration, at the thought moment of consciousness by way of sight, has been  indicated by the Commentator.  Note that it is described as an instruction made via *upalakkhana* (way of distinguishing) and *nidassana* (compartive way).  Therefore, the five-fold aggregate is taken as the object of meditation  

on consciousness by way of sight, so also is it in the following. 

21 

1. The five-fold aggregate in *pañcadvârâvajjana*, 
1. The five-fold aggregate in *sampaticchana*, 
1. The five-fold aggregate in *santîrana*, 
1. The five-fold aggregate in *vuttho,* 
1. The five-fold aggregate in *javana* (impulsion), 
1. The five-fold aggregate in *tadârammana*, 

Again in *manodvâravîthi* (in *manodvâravîthi*s that follows) 

1. The five-fold aggregate in *manodvârawajjana*, 
1. The five-fold aggregate in each *javana*, 
1. The five-fold aggregate in each *tadârammana*s, 

` `Note that it is the same in cases of *sotadvâravîthi* etc. 

A GOOD DISCIPLINE 

In meditation on *rûpa-nâma* by way of the five-fold *khandhâ*,  practice along the rows have been found to have a clearer consciousness.  Refer back to the good groups  

along  the *rûpârammana*  rows  in  the  table  of *Kammatthâna*.  Take *cakkhu-dvâravîthi*  and *manodvâravîthi*  (eye-door thought process and mind-door thought process),  influenced  

by *mahâkusala*  (great moral)  impulsion, which occupy the first row of the table as an example.  The concentration is made described below. 

1. The 54 species of corporeality as object together with *rûpârammana* of each and every *cittakhana* (thought moment) in the *cakkhudvâravîthi* and *manodvâravîthi* are understood by wisdom as ***rûpa***, ***rûpa*** …….. 
1. Every  *vedanâ*  (suffering)  associated  with  each  *cittakhana*  are  taken  as  object  and understood by wisdom as ***vedanâ**, **vedanâ*** …. 
1. Every *saññâ* (perception) associated with each *cittakhana* are taken as  object and understood by wisdom as ***saññâ*,** ***saññâ*** …. 
1. All *cetasika*s (mental concomitants), other than *vedanâ-saññâ*, are taken together as object and understood by wisdom as ***sañkhâra*,** ***sañkhâra*** …. 
1. Every *citta* (consciousness) associated with each *cittakhana* are taken as object 

`      `and understood by wisdom as ***viññâna*,** ***viññâna*** …. 

The good and bad groups in *rûpârammana* are meditated in similar ways.  Note that the same applies to those along the *saddârammana* (sound base). 

22 

WHAT TO CONCENTRATE UPON WHEN UNDERSTOOD 

If you have successfully practiced up to stage mentioned above, you should be  able to answer the question.  If not, the answer follows. 

` `At  every  thought  moment  of  *manodvâravîthi*,  that*  continue  taking  as  object *cakkhudvâravîthi rûpârammana* that appears while discerning on the *rûpârammana*, the  ultimate truth and *dhâtu* essence of the *rûpa-nâma* should be understood by  

wisdom as follows. 

1. **Four each of *âyatana*** according to *âyatana desanâ* ways. 
1. **Four each of *dhâtu*** according to *dhâtu desanâ* ways. 
1. **Five each of *khandhâ*** according to *khandhâ desanâ* ways. 

Now this is the answer to the above query.  This answer is just made  refering to  *nâma- rûpapariccheda ñâna* (insight knowledge of mind and matter)* = *ditthivisuddhi* (purifica- 

tion of views). 

` `Suppose you have come up to *paccayapariggaha ñâna* (knowledge of discerning the cause and result), you must discern the cause and result at every thought moment.  

(This will be appreciated well in section on Paticcasamppâda). 

A meditator ultimate reality of every individual of the ultimate element of the  five- fold aggregate, by way of *lakkhana-rasa-paccupatthâna*-*padatthâna*, at individual thought moment of the  *cakkhudvâravîthi* and *manodvâravîthi* , when he has come up to Lakkhanâdicatukka.  (This will be clear in section on Lakkhanâdicatukka). 

Again, if the meditator has attained the stage of *viappsanâ* he will have to concentrate on the three general characters, *anicca-dukkha-anatta*, of the ***khandhâ**, **âyatana*** and ***dhâtu***, which are present at every thought moment of the *cakkhudvâravîthi* and *manodvâravîthi*.   (This will be clear in section on Vipassanâ).   It is the same in the  

case of concentration on sound. 

All these are instructions of the Pâli-Atthakathâ-Tîkâ indicating how, when and  what to discern regarding the *paramatta* elements while at seeing and hearing stages. 

For  the  meditators  who  are  searching  for  the  true  *dhamma*s  of  the  Buddha  the Sabbaññuta Sammâsambuddha, those who are willing to penetratively understand, even in this existence, *asankhatadhâtu*, the element of peacefulness leading to the Path and the Fruit, those who are eager to be delivered from the *apâya* (miserable existences), those who are willing to be relieved entirely of the miserable ageing, death and decay, these are  

the instructions to take to heart, follow carefully and obediently. 

HE WHO DEFIES ABHIDHAMMÂ 

*Abhidhammam patibâhunto imassamin jinacakke pahâram deti, sabbaññutaññânam patibâhati, satthu vesârijjañânam patinivatteti, sotumâkam parisam visamvâdeti, ariya- magge âvaranam bandhati*.  *Atthârasasu bhedakaravatthusu ekassamin sandissati, ukkhepanîyakammakijjanîyakammâraho hoti*.  *Tam tam lammam katvâ uyojetabbo “gaccha vighâsâdo hutvâ jîvissatî”ti* (*Abhi.-Ttha*.-1: 30). 

23 

The above descriptions in the Atthakathâ are a warning to those who deny that the Abhidhammâ is not admonished by the Buddha, and to those who are under the impression that the *vipassanâ* exercise need not be made on the ultimate truth of *rûpa* and *nâma*, called the *khandhâ*, *âyatana* and *dhâtu*, as instructed in the Abhidhammâ.  What it  

really means is as follows. 

One who rejects the fact that Abhidhammâ is Buddha’s expatiation and hinders it, and that the *rûpa* and *nâma*, called the truth of *khandhâ*, *âyatana*, and *dhâtu*, that have been expounded in the Abhidhammâ should not and need not be meditated, is in fact hindering and deviating from the Buddha’s noble *sâsanâ*.  He is preventing the Buddha’s *sabbaññnuta ñâna* knowledge of Omniscience.  He lets down the Buddha’s brave *vesârajja ñâna* (the brave knowledge of perfect self-confidence).  He misleads those who are willing to listen to and practice the Abhidhamma dhamma (= *rûpa-nâma* in Abhi-dhammâ are not concerned with *sâvaka*s but are for Sabbaññ Sammâsambuddha and the *Arahant*s—those who are willing to listen to the Abhidhammâ are misled in this way to an erroneous concept).  It is the same as blocking the Path leading attain nobleness; it is one of distinct the factors that causes that brought about dissention among the Sanghâ 

` `called *bhedakara* (causing disunion in the Sanghâ). 

That  *Mahâthera* should neglected from daily affairs by the Sanghâ and to relieve him from the Buddhist order = an act of *upakkhepaniyakam*.  He should be censured by Sanghâ by way of *tajjniyakam*.   [What it means is: the argument that Buddhabhâsita (Buddha’s utterances) Abhidhamma is not the Buddhabhâsita is referred to as *vivâda* (contention).  “The Buddha Abhidhammâ would not bestow any benefit on human beings, the *sâvaka*s cannot meditate on the ultimate truth of the *rûpa* and *nâma*, how could any one concen-trate on these hundreds of millions of  *nâma dhamma*s which would have arisen and perished away within a blinking moment.” The demerit of the Abhidhamma are again indicated in this way.  Now the argument  on  the  Abhidhammâ  from  negative  side  means  committing   *dhamma  avannabhâsana*  (speaking bad of  

dhamma).  The *ukkhepaniyakam* as well as *tajjaniya* action should be taken on him.]. 

By taking these actions he should be sent off ordering him “Eater of others’  remainder—Make your living as a pauper.” (*Abhi.-Tha*.-1: 30). 

Gentlemen,  if  you  are  willing  to  attain  nibbâna,  be  careful  not  criticize  the Abhidhamma  without  reason  and  be  obedient  to  the  warnings  contained  in  the  above Atthakathâ. 

**THE FOUR-FOLD *VESÂRAJJA ÑÂNA*** 

Bhikkhûs ….  The Buddha’s brave knowledge called *vesârajja ñâna* are of four-fold.  The Lord fully endowed with these *vesârajja ñâna*s has declared himself to be the highest and possessed of sabbaññuta ñâna.  He possesses self-confidence in preaching of the way leading to salvation to the people.  He sets into Motion the Wheel of Truth.   

These four are as follows. 

1. The Buddha who declares himself to have penetratively realized, without any one’s help, by *sayambhû ñâna* (self-dependent knowledge) and to be the Sammâsambuddha (the perfectly enlightened one), said “I have acquired peace  

24 

and tranquility, freedom and bravery, because no one, be a *sâmana*, a *byamana*, a *devâ*, a *mâra*, in this world can argue as there still are *dhamma*s that I have not realized.” 

2. To the Buddha, who has declared himself to be a *khinâsava* (one whose mind is free from the mental obsessions), in whom all the *âsava dhammas* have been extinguished 
   1. an *Arahant*,  it  has been  asserted  as  “such  and  such *âsava*  still  remained  to be extinguished.”   I  have  not  come  across  any  *nimitta*  (sign),  in  either  *samana*,  or *byamana*, or *deva*, or *mâra* or any one in this world, who could have the right reason to indicate so.  For this reason I have attained the peace and tranquility, freedom and bravery. 
2. “The* assertion that the *dhamma*s that I have admonished are impediment to *jâna- magga-phala* is, in fact, not so to those who practice these *dhamma*s.”  I have not encountered any *nimitta* in either the *samana*, or *byamana*, or *deva*, or *mâra* or any one in this world, who could have the right reason to indicate so. For this reason I have come to acquire the peace and tranquility, freedom and bravery. 
2. “The indications that the *dhamma*s that I have given for purpose of cessation of the suffering from the rounds of rebirth, in fact, cannot afford deliverance to any one practicing  on  these  *dhamma*s.”  I  have  not  encountered  any  *nimitta*  in  either  the *samana*, or *byamana*, or *deva*, or *mâra* or any one in this world, who could have the right reason to indicate so. For this reason I have come to acquire the  

`      `peace and tranquility, freedom and bravery. 

Bikkhus ---- These are the 4-fold *vesârajja nanas* causing bravery.  The Buddha, endowed with these *vesârajja nanas* and admitting to possess *sabbaññuta ñâna*,  delivered the *dhamma*s bravely and set the wheel of *dhamma* into motion (*Am*.-1: 315.  *Vesârajja-Suttana*). 

Of these four-fold *vesârajja ñâna*, pay a careful attention to the fourth *vesârajja ñâna*. 

As  has  been  repeatedly  explained  previously—in  Salâyatanavagga  Samyutta  Pâli Aparijânana-Suttana  that  if  the  *rûpa*  and  *nâma  dhamma*  not  completely  understood analytically by means of the 3-fold pariñña paññâ to attain the *magga* and *phala*, there is  

no way of liberating from the suffering of sansâric circus (*Sam*.-2: 249 – 250). 

The eight noble *dhamma*s, called pubbbhâga satipatthâna magga preceding the *ariya magga*  (the  Noble  Path)  have  to  be  meditated,  by  the  three-fold  *pariññâ  paññâ*   to analytically realize the *rûpa* and *nâma* so as to attain *magga* and *phala*.  The 8-fold magga, the noble practice, are the *niyyânika dhamma*s (sanctifying factors) leading to salvation.  In other words, if these 8-fold *magga dhamma*s are practiced step by step, the *rûpa* and *nâma* are analytically realized by the 3-fold *pariñña paññâ* to have attained the *magga* and *phala*.  Such a realization itself is the *niyyânika dhamma* delivering one from  

the suffering of sansâric circus* (the rounds of rebirth). 

Suppose you are under the impression that “the *rûpa* and *nâma* given in the Abhi- dhammâ are not to be concentrated, but such and such phenomena, other than *rûpa* and *nâma*,  are to be concentrated in such and such a way.”    With reference to such a person  

the Atthasâlini Atthakathâ Sayâdaw given an explanation. 

25 

“An individual who hinders the Abhidhammâ is infact defying the noble dhamma called Buddha sasanâ.  He is reproving the *sabbaññuta ñâna* of the Buddha.  He is letting down the Buddha’s very brave *vesârajja nana*.  He is misleading those gentle persons  who are willing to listen to and to practice the good *dhamma*.” (*Abhi.-Ttha*.-1: 30). 

**Even a learned can err sometime**. 

**THE *ITTHÂRAMMANA*-*ANITTHÂRAMMANA* CONCEPT** 

\1.  *Samâsana Vâda* (Theory of Similar Concept) 

To begin with, similar statements made by honorable teachers, called the  *Samâsana vâda*, is be presented. 

The *ârammana* (the object) that is unpleasant and should not be sought (*rûpa-vedanâ- saññâ-sankhâra*) is the anitthârammana.  Whoever seeks that ârammana, in fact, it is the ârammana that should not be concentrated upon.  It is the kind of ârammana that is not acceptable, unglamorous, not to be taken to heart, that is not conducive to *kusala*  

*citta* (meritorious mind). 

In fact, it is completeness = far from pleasantness and hence an* unpleasant *âram- mana* that should not be accepted nor sought after.  [The *Sampatti* here refers to *sampatti*  *bhava* (blissful life) of sentient beings and *devâ*s.] 

In fact, the *anitthârammana* (physically), among the *kamma*-produced corpo-reality, are the results of karmically unwholesome deeds.  (These are the *vipâka nâma*  

groups that have arisen from the *akusala kamma* of *nâma dhamma*). 

Because it not the cause for the *sukhavedanâ*, this *ârammana* should not be acceptable.  Because it is not the true cause for the *sukhavedanâ* in the kind of *citta* that is  not conducive to mental faculty. 

In this mind-produced corporeality, the five-fold *ârammana karmaguna* (5-fold craving) produced by *akusala kamma* are all *anitthârammana*.  There is not such a thing as *anitthârammana* in *kamma*-produced corporeality arising from *kusala kamma*.  All the *kamma*-produced corporeality following the *kusala kamma* are the *itthârammana* (Abhi.- Ttha.-2: 8-9). 

The arising of the *kamma*-produced *ittha-anittha* is related to the sentient being bringing about that *kamma*-produced corporeality.  If a living being has cultivated *akusala kamma*, then it will encounter an *anittârammana kamma*-produced corporeality. If it is the *kusala kamma* that is cultivated, an *itthârammana kamma*-produced corporeality will be the result in due course.  ***Tasmâ kammajanam itthanitthatâ kamma-kârakasatthassa vasena yojanârahâ siya***. (*Mûlatî*.-2: 8). 

26 

**A CUP OF PRICELESS MEDICINE** 

The explanations given by this Atthakathâ-tîkâ are a priceless medicine for a gentle man.  The encounter of various unpleasant *anitthârammana* is the result of the cultivation of *akusala kamma* in the past.  One should not grumble by various sorts reasons as “It is because of something that it has occurred.  If so, then you are committing  

a great blunder referred to as *ayoniso manasikara* (a purposeless attention). 

When the *kusala kamma* is still in force, then that *kamma* will always be creating encounters with discontent *ârammana* and the discontent sentient beings.   Whenever the anitthârammana are encountered, and if they can be taken heart as “well, every body is the nmaker of his own future,” then in your *santâna* (life-continuum) *yonisomanasikara* ( a wise attention), the true basic causes of *kusala*, has made its appearance.  If the three characters of anitthârammana are concentrated by vipassanâ until their ultimate truth is acquired, then it is a kind of *yonisomanasikara* which has attained the peak of *vipassanâ*  

*ñâna* (insight knowledge). 

**AN EXPLANATION BY *MÛLATÎKÂ*** 

`            `The above *atthakathâ* has explained—***kusalakammajam anittham nâma natthi*** =  as a rule, *kamma*-produced corporeality resulting from *kusala kamma* never is an *anitthâ*- *rammana*.  The explanation does not include ***Akusalakammajam nittham nâma natthi*** = 

as a rule, *kamma*-produced corporeality resulting from *akusala kamma* never is an *itthâ*- *rammana*.   Because of this situation, if *akusala kamma*-produced *rûpa* happens to be pleasant (even though it is an *anitthârammana* for you who have cultivated *akuso kamma* beforehand), it may be *itthârammana* for other sentient beings.  Again other teachers are of the opinion that all the *kuso kamma*-produced corporealities are *itthârammana* for both  

self and others. 

As a continuation further explanations will be given.  Some sentient beings do not appreciate nor like the human features and his appearance.  Because of this dislike they would run away from his presence.  In the same way humans are frightened by the appearance and features of the *devâ*s.  Though the humans and sentient beings are scared away, the *cakkhuviññâna* (visual perception) etc. of *vipâkaviññâna* (resultant perception) takes that corporeality as object (physical object) that has arisen in the *santâna* of these frightened beings, appear as just the *kusalavipâkaviññâna*.  Similarly, in living beings scared of humans and humans scared of the *devâ*s, these features as *ârammana* cannot be pleasant because they lack the power resulting from good deed.  This is the opinion of the some *kecisayâ*s.  (The idea of *kecisayâ*’s is that all *kusala kamma*-produced corporealities are *itthâramman*.   Those who do not have adequate power in their *santâna* find these not charming when they come across these *itthârammana*. As the mûlatîkâsayâdaw disagrees  with these assertions, he has retorted as follows.) 

The explanation of the *Atthakathâ sayâ* is that the absence of *anitthârammana* in all  *kusala*  the  *kamma*-produced corporeality as well as the absence of the pleasant *itthârammana* in all the *akusalakamma-produced* corporeality, is an apt explanation. 

Indeed, the *kamma*-produced corporeality in the *santâna* of the sentient beings,  27 

like elephant etc. during the start of life, are the result of *akusala kamma* performed during a certain past existence.  The encounter by humans of the *akusala kamma*-produced corporeality of these beings, such as elephant etc., are the *akusalavipâkacitta* that appear due to taking these as object in their *santâna*.  (It means *Pañcaviññâna-sam- paticcha-nasantîrana-tadârammana*). 

When such beings as elephant etc. has grown into adult after growing gradually, called *pavatti* (formative stage), however, after period of rebirth stage, (to become a *mangala hsin* (lucky elephant) the *kuso kamma*-produced corporeality have the chance to make its appearance.  (The elephant, before attaining an elephant’s life when *akusala* *dhamma*s are cultivated to attain such a life on one hand, while on the other hand *kusala* meritorious deeds, such as *dâna* (alms-offering), were made so that both *kusala* and *akusala* are amix.  If rebirth resultant occurs because *akusala* has acquired more chance, the *kusala kamma* result can also arise so that *pavatti* results may occur in continuation.  By the power of *kusala kamma*, which could produce *pavatti* results, *kusala kamma*- 

produced corporeality in the form of a white elephant etc. may make its appearance.) 

By taking as object the *kusala kamma*-produced corporeality of sentient beings, such elephant etc., called *itthârammana*, which have gradually grown at the time of *pavatti* period, *kusalavipâkacitta* can arise in humans.  (*Pañcaviññâna-sampaticchana- santîrana-tadârammana-citta* is meant here.) 

The encounter by humans of *itthârammana* is also related to their *kusala kamma*,  but not to that sentient beings such as elephant etc.  

Although it is true that the *kamma*-produced corporeality of sentient beings such as elephants etc. can be an object of the human *kusalavipâkaviññâna*, but in the santâna of the sentient beings can there be *itthârammana kamma*-derived corporeality as well as the *anitthârammana kamma*-derived corporeality.  It means that as there can be *kusala kamma*- derived corporeality referred to as *itthârammana*, so can there be the akusala- kamma- produced corporeality, called the *initthâramma*.  Therefore, the *itthârammana* and *anitthârammana* are mingled.  In such a mingled state in the elephant etc., *anitthâ*-*rammana rûpa* called the *akusala kamma*-produced corporeality is only a minor case in the *santâna* of it when maturity is attained at a time of *pavatti* period. The *itthârammana*, the *kusala kamma*- derived corporeality (adequate enough to have attained the state of a *mangalâ* elephant) of the previous and present, however, is an overlapping major case. Therefore, however mingled the *itthârammana* of *kusala kamma*-produced and *anitthâ-rammana* of *akusala kamma*-produced corporealities may be, the *akusala kamma*-produced *anitthârammana*, as a minority, cannot be the real cause for arising of the many *akusalvipâkacitta* in the *santâna* of humans.   Probably, it could be asserted this way.  (In the *santâna* of elephant etc., during the time of *pavatti* period, only the *itthâramma*, which are the majority, is taken as object.  In the *santâna* of humans, concentrating on the *itthârammana*, *kusalavipâkacitta* has the chance to arise.  For this reason, *akusala kamma* produced-corporeality-*anitthârammana* cannot be the cause for the appearance of the *akusalavipâkacitta* in the humans.  This is what the whole idea is meant).  (Mûlatî-2: 8). 

28 

**THE OUTSTANDING FRATURES OF THE TWO *VÃDA***S** 

According to the *kecivâda* the splendid material forms, arising in the sentient beings such elephants when they have gradually attained maturity, are only the *anitthâ-rammana* *rûpa akusala kamma*-produced corporeality due to their cultivation in the past  

of the *akusalakamma*. 

According to Mûlatîkâsayâdaw, the *patisandhe kammaja rûpa* (*kamma*-produced rebirth phenomena) of the elephant etc. are only the *akusala kamma*-produced *anitthâ- rammana rûpa*.  It has been exsaptiated that the splendid *rûpa*s, which appear at *pavatti* 

period when maturity is attained, are the *kusokammajarûpa*s = the *itthârammana rûpa*s, which were cultivated in the past existence of these sentien beings.  (That is to mean that the ugly and inferior *rûpa*s are the *akusalakammaja rûpas*.  It is consistent with Añgutta- ranikâya Dassakanippâtti Jânusoni-suttana.  See *Am*. 3: 478 – 482). 

***So tattha lâbhî hotî**ti so tattha hatthiyoniyam nibbattopi mañgalahatthitthânam patvâ  lâbhî hoti*. (*Am.-Ttha.* 3: 339). 

In the *santâna* of elephant etc., during pavatti period, although the *itthârammana rûpa* 

- *akusalakammaja rûpa* and *anitthârammana rûpa* = *akusalakammaja rûpa* are intermingled, the latter are infinitesimal, but *kusalakammaja rûpa*s are of considerable magnitude.  Therefore, the Mûlatîkâsayâdaw is of the opinion that such an infinitesimal *akusalakammaja rûpa*s cannot be the cause for the arising of *akusalavipâkacitta* in the *santâna* of sentient beings like humans.  The sayâdaw once again expounded as given  

below. 

*Vipâkam pana kattaco na sakka vañcetunti vipâkavasena itthânitthârammanava-vatthânam sutthu vuttam*.  *Tasmâ tam anugantvâ sabbattha itthânitthatâ yojetabbâ.* 

` `(*Mûlatî*- 2: 8). 

Again in whichever *ârammana* it may be, the *vipâkviññâna* cannot be deceived.  Because of this determination of *itthârammana* or *anitthârammana* by virtue of *vipâkaviññâna*   (*Abhi.Ttha.-* 2:10), as explained by Tipitakasûlâbhayathera, has been mentioned in attakthâ.  Therefore, the determination *ittha* and *anittha* by power of that *vipâkaviññâna* only, the formation of *ittha* and *anittha ârammana* should be associated  (Mûlatî.-2: 8). 

Now this is the similarity of meaning by all the *atthakathâ sayâdaws*, the similar *attakathâ* = *samanavâda*. 

*VITANTAVÂDÎ VÂDA* 

SOPHISTRY 

An individual who would make fallacious speech that could disheartened the men  of wisdom is the vitandavâdî (a sophist).  He would speak oout as 

***Itthânittham** nâma pâtiyekkam pativibattam natthi*,  *tesam tesam rûcivasena kathitam*  (Abhi.-Ttha.-2: 9). 

There is no such a thing a the *itthârammana* and *anitthârammana* which can be analyzed individually as a single item each.  Determination of an *ârammana* as either the 

29 

*itthârammana* or the *anitthârammana* is related to individual living being’s like or dislike of it (that *ârammana*).  To the Great King Kosala the Buddha himself has admonished as  follows. 

- The Great King …. Among the five-fold *kâmaguna ârammana*, I have indicated that 

only the *ârammana* that is attractive and the heart’s liking is the extreme determinant and is noble.  The Great King …. Even that individual *årammana*s can be a heart stimula-ting for some, but not for the others.  The Great King …. A single kind of sounds, smells, tastes and touches can be the balm to the heart of some, but not to that of others.”  This what the Lord has expatiated in Sagâthâ-vaggakosala-samyutta Pañcarâja-suttana (Sam.- 

1: 80). 

With reference to the method as indicated above, a single *rûpârammana, saddâ*- *rammana, ganfhârammana, pholabbârammana* etc. may be pleasant and attractive *ârammana* for one, and cause the arising of clinging, attachment and *lobha* (greed) to that *ârammana*.  To the other these *ârammana*s could cause anger, a feeling of sorrow, and hate.  These *ârammana*s themselves may be the attractive, pleasing and adorable *itthâramman*s for one.  These may again be the disgusting, disagreeable and unadorable  

*anitthârammana*s for the other. 

The same *ârammana*s are taken  by optimist as pleasing and adorable, on the other hand, they displeasing unadorable for a pessimist.  Therefore, there no such a thing  

as *ittârammana* separate from *anitthârammana* in its own entity. 

In fact  countrymen living in the extreme periphery *paccantavâthî*) of the Majjhimadesa (the Middle Region) would find even the earthworms to be *itthârammana*, *attractive* and *adorable*.  For those living right inside the Majjhimadesa, however, would find these earthworms to be *anitthârammana*, irritable and rejectable.  Again the *paccan-tavâthî*, the countrymen, would find the meat of peacock to be irritable, inedible and unpleasant.  This is the the way of thinking of vitantavâdî with regard to itthârammana  

and anitthârammana (Abhi.-Ttha.-2: 9). 

THE REPLY 

In response to the idea of *vitantavâdî*, the *atthakathâ* has retored as follow. Ask the vitantavâdî as 

Do you mean there is no such a thing as *itthârammana* and *anitthârammana*  in its entity to determine separately? 

Suppose his answer was “*âma natthi* = well, no, there is not.”  Ask him the same question three times, and make  him answer *âma natthi* three times admittedly.  After- wards give him a problem to see what his answer would be. 

The question is “Is the *Nibbâna atta* or *anatta*”?  The *vitanta vâdî* might answer,  through knowledge of his own, indeed nibbâna is the *itthârammana*. 

He might remain silent, but in fact nibbâna is the *itthârammana*. 

Some people are sensitive and become angry when the merits of the nibbâna are  

30 

mentioned, and would angrily answer as follow. 

Well now you are talking about the merits and goodness of the *nibbâna*.  I would like to ask you if there were adequate and various kinds of eatables, flowers, perfume, essence, cosmetics, clothings and place to sleep—the five-fold *kâmaguna ârammana* in  

the nibbâna?  

The answer to question put by the *vitanda vâdî* would simply be “No.”  If such an answer is given by *sakavâdî*, a person whose idea is with the framework of the *sâsanâ*, and in continuation the *vitanda vâdî* should be told: You would close your ears and say  

“No.  *Alam tava nibbânena* = your nibbâna would be not advantageous.” 

The great noble *nibbâna dhamma* is indeed an *itthârammana*.  Even though it is so, there are no five-fold *kâmaguna ârammana*s to enjoy, for which the *nibbâna* when  viewed from the *vitanda vâdî*’s standpoint comes to be known as *anitthârammana*. 

*Anitthârammana* it may be for those who does not want, the great noble *nibbâna dhamma* should not and must not be taken as *anitthârammana*.  A person who implied the nibbâna to be anittha is one who possesses *viparitasaññâ* (altered perception) = wrong perception associated with the *lobha* (greed) associated with the enjoyment of the five-fold *kâmaguna ârammana*s.  Because of this wrong perception, he has asserted the  

remark “Hold it.  There is no benefit derivable from your nibbâna.” 

Because of changes of perception = *vippanlâsa* (transposition) alteration in the perception, an *ârammana* may be *itthârammana* for one who is in search of it.  At the same time that *ârammana* may be disagreeable and unacceptable for another (Abhi.- 

Ttha.-2: 9 – 10). 

Now these are the assertions in atthakathâ made in response to that of the *vitanda* 

*vâdî*. 

***SAÑÑÂVIPALLÂSA*** 

(**THE CONCEPT TRANSPOSITION**) 

The perceptions associated with *lobha* clinging to the *kâmaguna ârammana*s, which are not the true *ittha*, and believe them to be the *ittha*, the *nibbâna dhamma* and other *ârammana*s which are wrongly taken to be the true *anitth*—the perceptions which  here are said to be *viparitasaññâ* = perceptions subject to changes.  That *viparitasaññâ* is again explained as *saññâvipallâsa*.  Because of the *viparitasaññâ* the nibbâna, which lacks *kâmaguna ârammana*s inform of food and enjoyable substances, he simply honestly said “alam tava nibbânena = That is enough. There is no benfit in your nibbâna.”  The majority of the present day persons wishing for “immediate attainment of *nibbâna*” are, infact, usually have one thing in mind and another in the mind.  They want to acquire the nibbâna in no time.  They, however, do not practice in the right way to attain the nibbâna following the right path.  Having a heart of acquiring nibbâna, though they cannot

**THE THREE-FOLD *VIPALLÂSA*** 

***Vipallâsâ**ti anicca-dukkha-anatta-asubhesuyeva vatthûsu iccam sukhan attâ subha”ti  evum pavatto saññâvipallâso cittavipallâso ditthivipallâso ime tayo* (Visuddhi-2: 324). 

In the five-fold *upâdânakkhandhâ rûpa-nâma dhamma*s, which are the true *anicca, dukkha, anatta* and *asubha*, in other words in the *dukkha-saccâ* and *samudaya-saccâ dhamma*s, there are three-fold *vippllâsa*s: 

1. Wrong perception as (a) *Nicca*, (b) *Sukha*, (c) *Atta*, (d) *Subha*  =  *Saññâvipallâsa* 
1. Wrong notion as (a) *Nicca*, (b) *Sukha*, (c) *Atta*, (d) *Subha*  =  *Cittavipallâsa* 
1. Wrong view as (a) *Nicca*, (b) *Sukha*, (c) *Atta*, (d) *Subha*  =  *Ditthivipallâsa.* 

In this way there are three-fold *vippllâsa*s as *Saññâvipallâsa, Cittavipallâsa,* and *Ditthivipallâsa.*  There are four categories in each making it 12-fold of *vippllâsa* *dham- ma*s (Visuddhi-2: 324). 

Perceptions subject to change = *viparitasaññâ* arise because the *vippalâsa dhamma*s distinctly do exist from which no deliverance has been attained.  Based on the *viparita saññâ*, the living beings wrongly perceived *ittha* as *anittha* and vice versa.   They are having wrong notions and wrong perceptions and these are, indeed, the *ayoniso manasikâra* (the unwise attensions).  There is every possibility that *akusala dhamma*s  

could arise based on these *ayoniso maniasikâra*.* 

**DETERMINATION OF *IŢŢHÂRAMMANA* AND *ANIŢŢHÂRAMMANA*  ACCORDING**  

**INDIVIDUALS OF MEDIOCRE LIVING BEINGS** 

*Iţţhânitthârammanam pana pâtiyakkam vibhattam aţţhîti*.  *Kassa vasena vibhattanti*?  *Majjhimakasattassa* (*Abhi.- Ţţha*.-2: 10). 

Determination of *iţţhârammana* and *iniţţhârmmana* is given in the *Aţţhakathâ*. It is not ture that there never exist *iţţhârammana* and *aniţţhârammaņa* as asserted by the *vitandavâdî*.  Then how is it determined which are *iţţhâramaņa* and which are *aniţţhârammaņa*?  The explanation in the Aţţhakathâ is that it is made by virtue of wish a Mediocre person. 

Further explanation.  Determination of an *ârammaņa* as either *iţţha* or *aniţţha* should, however, be made by virtue of the great president, the King Mahâsudassanasak-kâya, King Dhammâsoka etc., who are of great  power.   Indeed, these powerful rulers, belonging to the higher strata, are not contended with nor appreciate an *ârammana* like ordinary foods, of celestial origin, comparable to the five-fold *ârammana karmaguna*, though the food is an *itthâramman*.  In their mind  this *ârammana* is taken to heart as not 

appreciable nor stumlating to their heart. 

For very poor, and of low strata, humans and sentient beings for whom getting a daily meal is hard effort, even the meal made broken rice, foul rice and curry would be  

delicious and will be *ittha* though it is indeed *anittha*. 

In dertermining whether an *ârammana* is *ittha* or *anittha*, it should be according  to the middle class humans’ (Pâmokkha, Minister, rich man, merchant etc.) definition. 

Therefore, good *rûpa-sadda-gandha-rasa-pholabba-dhamma* for middle class 

32 

humans are all *itthârammana*s.  The hard-to-come-by physical appearance and the sound of the Sammasambuddha etc. and those of man and woman are very pleasant and adorable *ati- itthârammana*s.    The smell of faecal materials, rotten dead dog and man are of repulsive kinds; disturbing sounds, unpleasant smell, disagreeable tastes and touches are *anitthârammana*s. This is how determination is made regarding the *itthârammana* and  *anitthârammana*.  This is the *atthakathâvâda*; the *samânavâda*. (*Abhi.-Ttha*.-2: 10).   

In this *vâda*, note that the formation of *ittha* or *anittha* on an object among the upper. Medium and lower strata humans does not occur during the *vipâkaviññâna*, but during by ***javanasena*** = the force of *javanna* (impulsion)   

***TIPIŢAKACÛLÂBHAYATTHERA VÂDA*** 

*Tipiţakacûļâbhayatthero panâha — “Iţţhâniţţham nâma vipâkavasena paricchinnam, na javanavasena.

*upajjati* (*Abhi-Ţţha-*2: 10). 

The Venerable *Tipiţakacûļâbhayatthera* has indicated as follows. 

The *iţţhârammaņa* and *aniţţhârammaņa* are determined not by the force of *javana* (impulsion) but by the force of *vipâkaviññâņa* (consciousness acquired through practice).  Because of wrong concept = the clinging, the attachment = may result in *lobha*, and also *dosa*, can be formed within a single *iţţhârammaņa* by force of *vipaļâsa*.  Within a single *aniţţhârammaņa*  can  be  formed  the  attachment  =  *lobha*,  and  also  *dosa*.   Therefore,  the *iţţhârammaņa* and *aniţţhârammaņa* should not be determined on the basis of the force of *javana*. 

Therefore,  the  *iţţhârammaņa*  and  *aniţţhârammaņa*  should  be  determined  only  by virtue  of *vipâkaviññâņa*.   In  fact *vipâkacitta*  never  deceives.   An *ârammaņa*  may be  an *iţţhârammaņa*—(let  the *javana*  dominated by  any  one  of  *kusla*,  *akusala*, *somanassa*,  *do- manassa*,  *upakkhâ*),  then  the  *vipâkaviññâņa*s  are  definitely  *kusalavipâka,  pañcaviññâņa*, *sampaţicchana*, *santîrana* of *tadârammaņa*s.  An *ârammaņa* may be an *aniţţhâram-maņa*— (let the *javana* dominated by any one of *kusla*, *akusala*, *somanassa*, *do-manassa*, *upakkhâ*), then  the  *vipâkaviññâņa*s  are  definitely  *akusalavipâka,  pañcaviññâņa*,  *sampaţicchana*, *santîrana* of *tadârammaņa*s.  For this reason, the determination of the  

*iţţhârammaņa* and *aniţţhârammaņa* should, in deed, be made by virtue of *vipâkaviññâņa*.

They would close their ears when the Buddha's sermon is heard.

***TIPIŢAKACÛLÂBHAYATTHERA VÂDA*** 

*Tipiţakacûļâbhayatthero panâha — “Iţţhâniţţham nâma vipâkavasena paricchinnam, na javanavasena.

**PAGE-313** 

The Venerable *Tipiţakacûļâbhayatthera* has indicated as follows. 

The *iţţhârammaņa* and *aniţţhârammaņa* are determined, not by the power of *javana* (impulsion), but by the force of *vipâkaviññâņa* (consciousness acquired through practice).  Because of wrong concept = the clinging, the attachment = may result in *lobha*, and also *dosa*, can be formed within a single *iţţhârammaņa* by force of *vipaļâsa*.  Within a single *aniţţhârammaņa*  can  be  formed  the  attachment  =  *lobha*,  and  also  *dosa*.   Therefore,  the *iţţhârammaņa* and *aniţţhârammaņa* should not be determined on the basis of the force of *jhâna*. 

Therefore,  the  *iţţhârammaņa*  and  *aniţţhârammaņa*  should  be  determined  only  by virtue  of *vipâkaviññâņa*.   In  fact *vipâkacitta*  never  deceives.   An *ârammaņa*  may be  an *iţţhârammaņa*—(let  the *javana*  dominated by  any  one  of  *kusla*,  *akusala*, *somanassa*,  *do- manassa*,  *upakkhâ*),  then  the  *vipâkaviññâņa*s  are  definitely  *kusalavipâka,  pañcaviññâņa*, *sampaţicchana*, *santîrana* of *tadârammaņa*s.  An *ârammaņa* may be an *aniţţhâram-maņa*— (let the *javana* dominated by any one of *kusla*, *akusala*, *somanassa*, *do-manassa*, *upakkhâ*), then  the  *vipâkaviññâņa*s  are  definitely  *akusalavipâka,  pañcaviññâņa*,  *sampaţicchana*, *santîrana* of *tadârammaņa*s.  For this reason, the determination of the  

*iţţhârammaņa* and *aniţţhârammaņa* should, in deed, be made by virtue of *vipâkaviññâņa*. 

*Kiccâpi hi micchâdiţţhikâ Buddham vâ samgham vâ mahâcetiyâdîni vâ uļârâni âram-manâni disvâ  ekkhîni  pidahanti*,  *domanassam  âpajjanti*,  *dhammasaddam  sutvâ  kaņņe  thakanti*, *cakkhuviññâņasotaviññâņâni pana nesam kusalaviâkâneva hunti* (*Abhi-Ţha-*2: 10). 

*Micchâdiţţhi*  (wrong  viewers),  those  with  conception  outside  the  bounds  of  the *sâsanâ*, turn their blind eyes when they encounter *Sammâsambuddha* (the Enlightened One), or  Ariya-Sanghâ  (the  Noble  Sanghâ)  or  Mahâ-Cetiya  (e.g.  Shwedagon)  etc.  of  noble *ârammaņa*s, feel unhappy at heart.  They would close their ears when the Buddha's sermon is heard.   Their  eyes  and  ears  may  be  closed,  and  having  heavy  hearts,  yet  the  chance  of instantaneous vision of *Sammâsambudha*s, and hearing of their sermons are due to their past *kusala*  (meritorious  deeds  of  their  previous  existence).   Because  of  these  deeds,  the *cakkuvññâna*  (seeing  consciousness)  and  *sotaviññâna*  (hearing  consciousness)  are  the *kusalavipâka*s (results of meritorious actions). 

When countryside pigs sense the smell of human organic refuse, they feel happy at heart due to the notion that they are going to have a feast on it.  The *cakkhuvññâna* that enable the pigs to see, the *ghânaviññâna* that enable them to smell, and *jivhâviññâna* that enable them to taste the refuse are *akusalavipâkaviññâna* which have resulted from the past *akusala* actions.  A pig, tied with ropes, may be laid on a comfortable bed by its owners, but the  pig  may  be  squeaking  distressfully.   But,  because  of  *saññâvipallâsa*,  the  wrong perception, the comfort provided could not be appreciated.  By such a wrong  

perception, a *jhâna* (absoprtion) of grief, instead of comfort, arises in the pig’s *jhâna*. The comfortable  feeling  of  the  bed  =  *kâya-viññâna-citta*  (consciousness  by  way  of  touch), associated with the *sukha*-*vedanâ* (feeling of joy) and which realizes *phoţţhabbâ*-*rammana*, is the result of good deeds in the previous life.  It is, therefore, only the *kusala upâka*.  The *ârammana* is the *iţţhârammana* (*Abhi*- *Ţha*-2:10). 

**Salient features of the Three *Vâda*s** 

With  regard  to  recognizing  *ârammana*  (object)  as  *iţţha*  (agreeable)  and  *aniţţha* (disagreeable) as described above, three *vâda*s have been recognized: *rucivasena*, *jhâna*- *vasena*, and  *vipâkavasena*. 

1. *Rucivasena* (sophistry) – A sophist differentiates *ârammana* either as *iţţha* or *aniţţha* according  to  his  own  liking.   *Ruci*  is  a  kind  of  *chandha*  that  arises  at  *javanacittupâda* (beginning of impulsive consciousness) moment.  In the sophistry, the nature of *iţţha* and  *aniţţha* are not considered separately. 
1. *Javanavasena* (determination of *iţţha* and *aniţţha* by virtue of impulsion) – In the *vâda* of *porâņakaţţhcariya* (ancient authorities), taking of a *jhâna* as *iţţha* or *aniţţha* by the people of upper, middle and lower strata does not arise at the instant of *vipâka*-*viññâna*, but only when *jhâna* is attained.  This *vâda*, therefore, is referred to as the principle of determining *iţţha* and *aniţţha* by means of *javana*.  In this *porâņakaţţhcariya*, there is a determination, in relation to sentient beings of middle stratum, of *iţţha* and *aniţţha*.  (In  

sophistry, there is no such a determination). 

3. *Vipâkavasena* – In the *vâda* of *Tipiţakadhara cûļa-abhaya mathera* the nature of the *iţţha* and *aniţţha* of a *javana* are separately recognized.  In so doing, it is not related with the *jhâna*, as is the case in the *porâņakaţţhcariya*, but with *vipâka*.  In the *iţţhârammana* may arise  *kusalavipâka*,  *pañcaviññâna*,  *sampaticchana*,  and  *tadârammana*  only.   In  the *aniţţhârammana*  may  arise  only*  the  *kusalavipâka*,  *pañcaviññâna*,  *sampaticchana*,  and *tadârammana*.   The  *ârammana*  (the  object  of  meditation)  of  the  *kusalaviññâna*s  is  the *iţţhârammana*, the *aniţţhârammana* being the *ârammana* of *akusalaviññâna*s.  The relation of determination of *iţţha* and *aniţţha* with *vipâka*, but not with *jhâna*, is the only distinct feature of *vipâkavasena*. 

**The Vâda that the Venerable Mahâbuddhaghosa Appreciated** 

Of the three above *vâda*s, the Venerable Mahâbuddhaghosa seems more favorable  to that of the Venerable *Tipiţakadhara cûļa-abhaya mathera*, as indicated below. 

*Yathâ cittha, evum sabbattha – yo yo aţţhakathâvâdo vo theravâdo vâ pacchâ vuccati so  pamâņto daţţhabbo* (*Vi*- *Ţha -* 1:260) 

It has been asserted in *Parâjikam* *Aţţhakathâ* second *Parâjika Padabhâjanî-yavuņņa* as – Such and such *aţţhakathâ vâda* as well as *theravâda* have been explained  

lastly.  And that last explained *vâda* is worth taking to heart. 

*Mûļaţîkâ* Sayâdaw too has stated as given below. 

*Vipâkam pana katthaci na sakkâ vañcetunti vipâkavasena* 

` `*iţţhâniţţhârammanavavutthânam suţţu vuttam* (*Mûļaţî*-2:8) *Vipâkavasena sundaram vuttanti vipâkavasena Tipiţakadhara-cûļa-abhayattherena vuttham su sundaram, rucivasena javanavasena vuttham sundaranti*  

*addhippâyo*. – *Madhu*.  

*Vipâkaviññâna* cannot be circumvented whatever the *ârammana* may be.  The explanation that  determination  of  *iţţha*  and  *aniţţha*  only  by  virtue  of  *vipâkaññâna*  is  a  good  work.  Therefore,  the  Mûlaţîkâ  Sayâdaw  Venerable  Ãnandâ  Mathera  also  seems  to  like  the determination of a *jhânana* either as *iţţha* or *aniţţha* by power of *vipâkaviññâna*,  

but not the one made on the basis of one’s own liking.   

**A Hard Nut to Crack** 

For  a  noble  person  possessing  knowledge  that  analytical  realization,  and  when encountered with a *jhâna*, can determine whether *pañcaviññâna, sampaţicchana,*  

*Santîrana* and *tadârammana* are *kusalavipâkaviññâna* or *akusalavipâkaviññâna*.  This is made so based on the number and kinds of *cittacetasikka sampayutta dhamma* (*dhamma*s associated with mental factors) groups included in the culture *vipâka ñaņa*.  For a foolish *andhabâla* (blinded by folly) *puthujana* (human), who is still blind to the *paramattha* *ñaņa* (eye of knowledge of ultimate truth) on encountering a *jhâna* cannot determine either as *kusalavipâkaviññâna* or *akusalavipâkaviññâna*.  Here, however, realization by one of either *kusalavipâka* or  *akusalavipâka* is not necessarily important.  It must be noted that arising of *kusalavipâkaviññâna* in *iţţhârammana* and of *kusalavipâkaviññâna*  

in the *iţţhârammana* is of prime importance. 

Realization  by  one’s  own  self  is  concerned  only  with  acquirement  of  *nâma*-*rûpa pariccheda* *ñaņa*. 

**It is Not Only Due to *Saññâvippallâsa*** 

The *vippallâsa* is not the only cause for wrong notion of  

1. *Iţţha* as *aniţţha* and 
1. *Aniţţa* as *iţţha*.  

It can also be due to 

1. By power of *sîtatejo* (cold temperature) in cold season when the temperature is in extreme condition, and *ohņatejo* (hot temperature) is in extreme condition, and changes of element called *dhâtukkhobha* (alteration of elements) = shock due to altered elements and  
1. The causes such as poor eyesight, hard of hearing, lost of taste, and old-age debilities  

of controlling principles, for example the eye power etc. 

Because of the wrong notion of the *Iţţha* as *aniţţha* and* vice versa, the *Kusala- vipâka* and *akusalavipâka* are formed correspondingly. 

Cold water during the hot season can relieve one of suffering from heat, and it is the cause from arising of *kusalavipâkaviññâņa*.  For that person cold water is an *iţţhâ-* 

*rammana* which a gives a good feeling on contact. 

The cold water again becomes the cause for arising of *akusalavipâka kâyaviññņa* for a person suffering cold during the cold season.  The cold water on contact gives a bad feeling of *aniţţhârammana* on the person feeling very cold. 

A piece of cotton wool, which usually gives a smooth feeling on touch, could be the cause for painful feeling when applied on a fresh wound, for *akusalavipâka dukkha sahagutta kâyaviñâņa*.  The touch with the cotton wool is an *aniţţhaphoļabbârammana*  

causing a painful feeling on the wound. 

The contact with the cotton wool is the cause of good feeling for a person without wound. The cause for arising of *kusalavipâka sukasahagutta kâyaviñâņa*.  The contact with the  cotton  wool  is  an  enjoyable  feeling  of  *iţţhaphoļabbârammana*  for  a  person  without wound.   Message  with  a  gentle  hand  will  be  a  good  feeling  and  forms  *kusala*-*vipâka sahagutta* for the one messaged.  This is because the object is an *iţţhârammana*.  The same gentle hand will cause an unpleasant suffering and *akusalavipâka sahagutta*  

when slapped in the face.  It is an *aniţţhaphoļabbârammana* for the one being slapped. 

Determination of *iţţha* and *aniţţha*  based on *vipâka* as explained by the Venerable  *Tipiţakadhara cûļa-abhaya mathera* is quite acceptable (*Mûlaţî* – 2:10). 

With reference to the determination of  *iţţha* and *aniţţha*, the early teachers used to assert “*vipâka* as the right and *jhâna* the opposite.”  It is the *kusalavipâka* if the object is *iţţhârammana*, and *aniţţhârammana* object for the *akusalavipâka*.  The *jhâna*, even if it is *iţţhârammana*, may be influenced by *dosa*- *jhâna* (impulsion of hate), instead of *somanassa*- *jhâna* (impulsion of feeling of joy), because of the *saññâvipallâsa*.  It so happens because, though the right arising *vipâka*-*citta* (resultant consciousness) occurs,  

the arising of *jhâna citta* (impulsion consciousness) is abnormal. 

**Determination of *Iţţha* – *Aniţţha* by Way of *Dvâra*** 

One should also know the way of determining *iţţha* and *aniţţha* by virtue of dvâra.  Soft and delicate texture of human organic refuse is repulsive to *cakkhu-dvâra* (eye door) and *ghâna-dvâra* (nose door) is *aniţţhârammana*.  Because of its smooth texture to the  

contact with the hand, it is *pholabbârammana* to *kâyadvâra*.  

For those who have been thrown at with ruby by King Cakkavatta, or one who has been pierced through with his gold lance, find these two to be the *aniţţhârammana*s to their *kâyadvâra*, but are *iţţhârammana*s to their *cakkhudvâra*.  This is because the ruby or the lance in the presence case cause a great suffering to the subject. It should be, in fact, noted that, determination of either *iţţha* or *aniţţha* is made via the power of *iţţha-vipâka citta*. 

In this way the determination of either *iţţha* or *aniţţha* can be achieved by the  following ways: 

1. By way of wish in individuals of middle strata, 
1. By the power of *vipâka* *citta*, 
1. By way of the *dvâra* (sense door), and 
1. By way of the season such as cold or hot. 

***USSADA KITTANA KATHÂ*** (The Dominance Expresses Itself) 

The description of the causes of the merits of *guņa* of *alobha* and demerits of *lobha* in many and varied ways are referred to as *Ussada Kittana Kathâ*.  It is section which gives a good lesson, as given below, to those who are only at the stage of sansâric travelers. 

1. To be delivered from the *bhava,* 
1. For attainment of a *bhava* of a higher state, 
1. To change the *citta-dhâtu* to a better state, 
1. To elevate the *citta-dhâtu*. 

If a meditator happens to be an *Uttamapurisa*, a man of highest ideal, who can 

terminate the sansâric journey in the present existence, then this section would not necessarily apply to him.  For one who cannot end the sansâric journey however hard he  

tried, or expecting future existence, then this section will be of utmost importance. 

If  you  meditator  have  successfully  cultivated  the  *rûpa*  and  *nâma*  *dhamma*s analytically to the ultimate truth, then it is expected of you that you have realized 

1. The causes of *kusala* and 
1. The causes of the *akusala*. 

The merits and demerits of *kusala* and *akusala* through out the *sansâric* circus have been described in this chapter.  This ***Ussada Kittana Kathâ*** is explained in *Aţţhâlinî Aţţhakthâ* as follows. 

In the *santâna* of sentient being traveling round and round sansâric circus are 

1. Excessive *lobha*, 
1. Excessive *dosa*, 
1. Excessive *moha*, 
1. Excessive *alobha*, 
1. Excessive *adosa*, and 
1. Excessive *amoha*. 

What makes these permanent, and what causes these excessive? 

*Pubbehetu niyâmeti*.  *Kammâyûha-nakkhaņeyeva nânattam hoti* (*Abhi*-*Ţţha*-: 1 – 308). 

*Pubbehetu*, the factors of the past, are the cause for permanency and variety, and exert management over these.   When effort had been made in the past, which has resulted in the still functioning *kamma* of the present *bhava*, they have been of various kinds, differing in different individuals. The *kamma*s have caused the resultants as greedy  

persons or non-greedy persons etc.  See the following explanation sensu lato. 

**INDIVIDUALS OF THE FIRST KIND** 

*Yassa hi kammayûhanakkhaņe loko balavâ hoti, alobho mando, adosâmoho blavunto, dosamohâ mandâ, tassa mando  alobho lobham pariyâdâtum nasakkoti, adosomohâ pana balavunto dosamohe pariyâdâtum sakkonti*.  *Tasmâ so tena kammena dinnapaţissandhi- vasena nibbatto luddho hoti, sukhasîlo akkomano, paññâvâ pana hoti vjirûpañaņoti* (*Abhi*-*Ţţha*-: 1 – 308).* 

In the *santâna* of a person at the moment of cultivating in the past for acquiring  

the five-fold *khandhâ*s of the present the following would prevail. 

1. *Lobha* would in its full strength. 
1. *Alobha* would be weak and in dormant state. 
1. *Adosa* (= *mettâ*), *amoha* (= *paññâ*) are in their full strengths. 
1. *Dosa* and *moha* are weak and in dormant state. 

When effort had been made on the *kamma* cultivation, the weak and dormant  *alobha* was not able to exert its influence on the eradication or overcoming of *lobha*. 

Again at a time of *kamma* was cultivation the *adosa* and *amoha* were so strong that they overcome and eradicate the *dosa* and *moha*.  Therefore, a person in a certain life time, via rebirth, when a *kamma* of high *dosa* was functioning, will result as an individual given below. 

1. A greedy person (result of being greedy). 
1. Thought greedy, he lives a peaceful life.  Not easily angered = not short-tempered. (result of being non-greedy). 
1. A man of wisdom with sharp mental properties. (result of *amoha*) 

(*Abhi*-*Ţha*-: 1 – 308). 

Because when *kamma* was performed, it was overwhelmed with greed, resulting in a greedy person highly attached to both living and non-living *kâmavatthu*.  Because of *adosa* = powerful *mettâ*-*kamma* on other living beings, *sukhasîla* = he used to lead a peaceful life, being not annoyed, not angered and of a good temperament.   Because of *amoha* = *kamma* of high *nâņa paññâ*, he becomes a person of wisdom sharp like a thunderbolt.  The property of the past element is reflected in the present.  And such  

properties will exert their influence in the future life. 

The story of the would-be wealthy Jotika and his elder brother, each offering a sugar cane to a *paccekabuddha*, at a certain time before the enlightened Vipassî and prior  

to the arrival of *sâsanâ* should be flashed back. 

The younger brother, offering a sugar cane, wished for the peaceful existence as  human-*devâ-nibbâna*, while the elder brother wished for the *nibbâna* only. 

The alms offered are similar as was the alms recipient.  But their minds were set differently.  The younger brother *Jotika* cultivated his *dâna kamma* surrounded by *lobha* attached to richness as a human and a *vedâ*.  While making such an offer, he had *adosa mettâ dhâtu* upon the *paccekabuddha*.  The knowledge of *Sammâdiţţhi-ñâņa*, which understands the *kamma* and its resultant formations, prevails in his heart.  As the elder brother made a wish only for the *nibbâna*, his *dâna*-*kamma* was surrounded by *alobha*,  

*adosa amoha dhatu*s only.  These three elements were in full power then. 

At the time of resultant formation of these *kamma*, the two brothers were reborn to an extremely rich  man.    On encountering the *sâsanâ* of the Enlightened Vipassî, the elder brother, who had cultivated the *kamma* surrounded by *alobha*, *adosa* and *amoha*, transferred al his wealth to his younger brother, and entered the world of the *sâsanâ*.  He practiced on the *dhamma*s to become an ascetic.  He was able to relieve himself of attachment to all the wealth acquired based on *alobha* *kamma*, for which he became a  

non-greedy person.*  By power of *adosa* = *mettâ*-*dhâtu*, he led a peaceful ascetic life.  By the power of *amoha* = *ñâņa paññâ*, he had realized the four Noble Truth analytically so as to attain Arahatta-Magga (the Path of Arahatta) and Arahatta-Phala (the Fruit of 

Arahatta).  He acquired a life of a man of great wisdom. 

The younger brother, on the other hand, cultivated the *kamma* surrounded by *lobha* and with attachment to richness, could not relieved himself of his wealth.  Greatly attached to his wealth, he became a greedy person.  The *alobha*-*dhâtu* of his could not overwhelm the powerful *lobha-dhâtu*.  That *kamma* was, however, surrounded by *adosa* = *mettâ*-*dhâtu* and *amoha* = *ñâņa paññâ*, for which he had a powerful *mettâ*-*dhâtu* upon the Enlightened Vipassî.  He built a monastery which he offered as *dâna* to Him.  He also  

bore a great *mettâ*-*dhâtu* upon all human beings. 

With a mind influenced by *mettâ*, he spread  rubies knee-deep around the monastery.  A declaration allowing any body to take a handful of rubies has also been made.  This was made for mankind to acquire *kusala*-*cetanâ*s by paying homage to the Enlightened Vipassî, to be  able  to  culture  *kusala  dhamma*s  by  listening  to  His  sermon,  and  to  acquire  special knowledge.  He bore very high loving-kindness on human beings.  He had in mind that those who did not want to pay homage, but still want the rubies, would come to the monastery.  Then they would pay homage and listen to the expatiation of the Enlightened Vipassî.  If so they  could  acquire  *Magga*  *ñâņa*  and  *Phala-ñâņa*.   These  are  the  noble  *mettâ*  and  noble consciousness the he had on the mankind. These are results of causes such as *adosa* and *amoha*.   But  because  his  *alobha*-*dhâtu*  could  not  annihilate  the  *lobha*-*dhâtu*,  he  had  to journey through (91) worlds.  In the duration of each world, the collection of human bones of a single person, if left undestroyed, could attain the height Mount Vepulla.  If a man has to pass through (91) worlds, then the total heap of his bones will of the height of (91) such mountains.  Therefore, clinging to the human *bhava* and the riches, or culturing a *kamma* surrounded  by  *lobha*-*dhâtu*  clinging  to  a  human  *bhava*  or  its  riches  is  no  better  than attachment to death and decay resulting in such a huge heap of bones.  The wealthy Jotika, on the other hand, also wished for *nibbâna* and has resulted in being relieved of all the worldly affairs during time the  

Buddha *sâsanâ*. 

If Ussada Kittana Kathâ scrutinized, it will be seen that depending upon the past  *kamma*, the corresponding results would arise in the present existence as given below. 

1. A greedy and non-greedy person, 
1. A bad-tempered person and a good-tempered one, 
1. A man of great wisdom and of an inferior wisdom. 

One can realized that the past *kamma* organized the above three situations.  Whatever *kamma* one may have performed in the present existence, it would give corresponding  results in the consecutive lives to come. 

Therefore, in cultivating a *kamma*  it should be surrounded by noble *mettâ*-*dhâtu*, *karuņâ* and higher wisdom, but not by inferior *dhâtu*s such as the *lobha*, *dosa*, *mâna* (conceit), *issâ* and *micchera*. 

Now that we are in the domain of Buddha *sâsanâ*, we should practice as given  

below. 

Way of practice for acquirement of *samâdhi* is in hand, all we have to do is to make effort  to  have  lofty  *mettâ*-*dhâtu*,  good  consciousness  and  *mettâ*-*javana*.   There  also  are instructions for practicing to acquire higher status of *karuņâ-dhâtu, muditâ-dhâtu* and*  *upekkhâ-dhâtu* and maintained in the heart. 

If  you  have  successfully  practiced  these  *samâdhi*  exercises  and  put  to  practical application,  the  *mettâ*-*dhâtu  karuņâ-dhâtu,  muditâ-dhâtu*  and  *upekkhâ-dhâtu*  will  always reside in your consciousness.  Then your mind will always be of very highly state.  If you cultivate a *kamma* surrounded by such a high state consciousness, then when a result has  

a chance to arise in certain existence you will be endowed the following qualities on the   sentient beings 

1. A person of  great *mettâ*-*dhâtu*, 
1. A person of  great *karuņâ-dhâtu*, 
1. A person of great *muditâ-dhâtu*, and 
1. A person of great *upekkhâ-dhâtu*. 

These are minds of higher state a traveler along the sansâric journey should have upon fellow travelers.  These are the most desirable very noble exercises and are therefore  

designated as the *brahmacariya* (good walk of life). 

In this *sâsanâ* also are present very high standard of exercises for *paññâ*.  Just refer back to the section on the *rûpa-kammaţţâna* and *nâma-kammaţţhâna* described previously.  Exercise in discerning infinitesimal particles, called *rûpa*-*kalâpa* in the *rûpa*-*loka* (material world), realization by eye of wisdom of these atomic particles and their ultimate truth, *vîthi*- *citta*  (thought  process)  that  arises  along  the  *citta*-*niyâma*  (methods  of  mental  culture) concentrated to the attainment of the ultimate truth are all explicitly given in the Sammâ- Sambuddha Buddha *sâsanâ*.  The exercises for concentration on causal relationship *paţicca- samuppâda* and for *vipassanâ* are available in this *sâsanâ* only.  If  

practically successful in exercising on these, then the following can be acquired. 

1. *Nâma-rûpa-pariccheda* *ñâņa* the insight knowledge of mind and matter, 
1. *Paccaya-pariggaha ñâņa* the analytical knowledge realizing the causes of mind and matter 
1. *Vipassanâ ñâņa* the insight knowledge that realizes the *anicca, dukkha, anatta* of *sankhâra dhamma*s to the attainment of the Path and the Fruit, 
1. *Ariya Magga* *Ñâņa*  Noble Path knowledge, 
1. *Ariya Phala Ñâņa* Noble Fruit knowledge. 

These are  knowledges of very high status, not  available anywhere  except in the Buddha *sâsanâ*, nor are they available in the modern science world, nor in philosophies outside  

the *sâsanâ*. 

A meditator’s mind decorated with such knowledge of higher state is also highest *citta*-*dhâtu*.  The *rûpa*-*nâma* *santâna* of a meditator’s mind practiced to attain a high state  could provide the following benefits. 

1. Deliver him from *apâya* (miserable world) 
1. Deliver him from miserable phenomena of ageing, suffering, death and decay and rebirth. 
3. If the meditator is still going round the sansâric journey, it will organize in such a        way as to make him a clever man of wisdom. 

These indicate how you can uplift your *citta*-*dhâtu* by cultivating high state *mettâ- dhâtu*, *karuņâ-dhâtu*, *muditâ-dhâtu, upekkhâ-dhâtu*, *alobha-dhâtu*, *adosa-dhâtu* and *amoha- dhâtu* (wisdom).  In this way the wisdom would raise your *bhava* to a higher status and relieved you of miserable sufferings.  In a way, it uplifts a man above ordinary  

man and a deity above the other deity. 

The  *buddha*s,  innumerable  as  sand  grains  on  the  banks  the  River  Ganges,  have become enlightened because of cultivating *citta-dhâtu* decorated with better elements such as the ten-fold *paramî*s.  You, gentleman, can also have the mind which can be  

enlightened if you make great effort in improving it. 

If you culture your mind surrounded by inferior *citta-dhâtu*, then your *citta* will  be of inferior status, and you would be leading a variety of *bhava*s of low quality. 

Suppose  you  cultivated  your  *kamma*  surrounded  by  *lobha*  as  attachment  to  one another as a husband and a wife and wishing that you are always together be it the life of a bird, and suppose you two have perform *kusala kamma* together.  At a certain time, when that *kamma* bears result, and if you happen to encounter one another, then you will always be intimately together.  Unfortunately, if one partner has been a drunkard, you, as 

wife, will still be attached to him however much abuse he would inflict on you.  

In the same way if you had wished for a life as a wealthy person, and the time for result has come, then you will acquire a wealthy life attached to your wealth like the wealthy Jotika.  If your wish has been for higher professional post, you will be attached to it. 

If you have cultivated a *kamma* surrounded by *dosa*, and dissatisfaction, you will become a man of great anger and of dissatisfaction when that *kamma* bears the result.   

You will not be satisfied with any body in the world. 

Suppose you cultivated *kamma* been surrounded by *citta-dhâtu* of boastfulness, will to take advantage over others, being self-esteemed, and looking down upon others – that is *lobha* and *mâna*.  Then that *kamma* will result in you being a boastful person, and  high-handed in dealing with others, will always be thinking high of yourself.   

If your *kamma* is cultured surrounded by envious mind on others, then when that  *kamma* produced result, you lead and envious *bhava*.  This *issa dhamma*, which is a mind  envious on others’ success or wealth endowed with powers which can end the life a *devâ*.  

A *kamma* cultivated with *maccheriya*-*dhâtu* (selfishness) would result in a person overwhelmed by *maccheriya*.  He would be too sensitive to those even lingering to his  possessions including his wealth, wife and children. 

Realizing the above situations, if you would like to be delivered from the sansâric circus, or like to lead a *bhava* of higher status, then you will have change your mind and raise to a higher standard.  Every day and from moment to moment, with the motion of your hands, legs and mouth there occur *kâya-kamma, vajî-kamma* and *mano-kamma*,  

(the  body  function,  verbal  function  and  mental  function).   For  these  *kamma*s  to  be  surrounded always by good elements effort is made on *samatha*, *vipassanâ* and *bhâvanâ* exercises  most the time.  In other words, the *kamma*s should be surrounded by *saddhâ,  vîriya, sati, samâdhi* and *paññâ*. 

**INDIVIDUALS OF THE SECOND KIND** 

*Yassa pana kammayûhanekkahņe lobhadosâ balavunto hunti, alobhadosâ mandâ, amoho balavâ, moho mando, so purimanayeneva luddho ceva hoti duţţho ca, paññavâ pana hoti*  

*vajîrûpamañâņo, dattâbayatthero viya*

A person, at the moment of cultivating a *kamma*, might have *lobha* and *dosa* in his *santâna*.   He would have a heap of *lobha* attached to the prevailing *bhava*, to the material things  and  his  status in  the  society  while  trying  to  cultivate  meritorious  *kamma*.  At  that moment *alobha* and *adosa* (*metta*-*dhâtu*) factors very recessive.  *Ahoma*, *paññâ*, however, quite dominant.  When the *kamma*, cultured with surrounding *lobha*, has the chance to bear result, the person would be a greedy one.  The *kamma* cultured surrounded by *dosa*, would result in a person of great *dosa* (anger).  Because of *amoha-dhâtu* during 

` `that moment, the person would be of sharp wisdom like Tattâbhaya Mathera. 

**INDIVIDUALS OF THE THIRD KIND** 

*Yassa pana kammâyûhanaekkhaņe lobhadosamohâ balavunto hunti, ittare mandâ*.  *So  purimanayeneva liddo ceva hunti candho ca*, *sukhasîlako pana hoti ekkodhano* 

A person at the moment of culturing a *kamma* (= a *kusala* *kamma* resulting in a human *bhava*) has powerful *lobha*, *adosa* and *moha* in his *santâna*.  The *alobha*, *dosa* and *amoha*, on the other hand, are weak.  At a time when that *kamma* produces a resultant *bhava* by rebirth power, the person would be a greedy individual.  It is because the weak *alobha* could  not  influence  the  powerful  *lobha*.   In  the  same  way,  the  weak  *amoha*  could  not overwhelm the poweful *moha*, for which the person would become mentally low, dumb and dull individual.  When the *kamma* was cultivated, however, *dosa* was recessive but *adosa* was dominant.  Because of powerful *adosa* = *metta*, it could dominate the  

weak *dosa*, resulting in man having peace of mind and of a good tempered in nature. 

**A FACT TO BE NOTED** 

It should be noted of the fact that if a good deed is done by someone without wisdom, then  the  resultant  individual  in  a  certain  *bhava*  will  be  an  ignorant  person  of  inferior mentality.   A *kamma* should not performed without due consideration.  It is because once a *kamma* has been performed, then it cannot be withdrawn.  (The cause *kamma* will always produce result, good or bad).  It can only be eradicated by *Vipassanâ ñâņa*, *Magga-ñâņa*, and *Phala*-*ñâņa*.    The  eradiation  is  the  function  of  *Arahatta-Magga*-*ñâņa*.   The  *kamma*s  of whatever  kind  that  is  going  to  give  results  in  the  wake  of  *parinibbânacuti*  can  only  be eradicated by *Arahatta-Magga*-*ñâņa* because it has the  

power to do so. 

At the expense of money, one performs a good deed, but it results in an ignorant, dumb and low-grade person, which is thing of sorrow.  Therefore, whatever good deed is done it has to be associated with wisdom.  Now a brief explanation on *ñâņa* and *paññâ* is  pertinent here. 

***CATUSACCASAMMÂDIŢŢHI*** 

(The Right Vision on the Four-Fold Realities) 

*Katamâ ca bhikkhave sammâdiţţhi*?  *Yam kho bhikkhave dukkhe ñâņam, dukkha samudaye ñâņam, dukkha nirodhe ñâņam, dukkhagâminiyâ paţpadâya ñâņam*. *Ayam vuccati bhikkave sammâdiţţhi* (*Ma*.- 1 :88). 

*Sammâdiţţhi*, *paññindre = paññâ, amoha, dhammavicaya* all different terms  referring to the single *dhamma* *paññindre cetasika*. 

1. The  knowledge  that  realizes  the  five-fold  *upâdânakkhandâ*  and  *dukkhasaccâ* *dhamma*s  existing  as  *atîta*  (past),  *anâgata*  (future)  and  *paccuppanna*  (present),  *ijjhatta* (internal), *bahiddha* (external), *oļârika* (gross), *sukhuma* (subtle), *hîna* (low),  *paņîda* (lofty), *dûra* (far), *santika* (near) phenomena. Among the *saccâ dhamma* group are included *jhâna dhamma*s. 
 
2. As exhorted in the Añguttora Tikanipâta Tithâyatana Suttana, the knowledge that realizes the  causal  relationships  of   *paţiccasamuppâda*  in  its  real  sense  and  understands  the *samudaya-saccâ*  Here  in  this  case,  *kammassakatâ  sammâdiţţhi*,  which  can  pene-tratively realize  the *kamma*–its results, involved completely.  This is the *kammassakatâ sammâdiţţhi* of highest status.  This knowledge, not acquired from others, but from one’s own penetrative practical realization of the *kamma* and its resultants, is therefore referred to as highest state of knowledge.  Knowledge of *kamma*-resultant acquired from the teachers is not as high as that from one’s own practical understanding.  Though relatively not high, for *puthujana* humans who cannot yet attain *paramatta* by eye of wisdom, the knowledge acquired through the teachers  could  be  employed  as  basis  to  guess  *kamma*-resultant  phenomena  by  means  of *anumâna* consciousness.  This can be *kammassakatâ* –*sammâdiţţhi*. If realization cannot be made even of *kammassakatâ sammâdiţţhi*, or not acquired at all, then any *kusala-kamma* would be of very low status.  If that kind of  

*kamma* bears result, the person would be ignorant, dumb and inferior. 

3. *Vipassanâ  ñâņa*  (insight  knowledge)*  that  penetratively  understands  the  *bhañga*  or perishing  away  of  the  arising  and  dissolution  of  *sankhâra  dhamma*s,  *asankhata-dhâtu,* peaceful element the *nibbâna* which are the *dhamma*s of the cessation of the *sankhâra*s = *ariya  magga*  *ñâņa*  which  penetrtatively  realizes  *nirodha  saccâ*  phenomenon,  are  all  the  *sammâdiţţhi ñâņa*.  (The *vipassanâ ñâņa* is the *lokî sammâdiţţhi*, and the *ariya magga* *ñâņa* the *lokuttara sammâdiţţhi*).  This the *sammâdiţţhi* which understands the *nirodha*  *sacca* (the truth of cessation). 
3. Realization  of   the  *lokî  magga  saccâ*  and  *lokuttarâ*  *magga  saccâ*  penetratively,  via penetrative  exercises,  to  the  attainment  of  *nibbâna*,  where  the  *dukkha*s  (sufferings)  have ceased, is *sammâdiţţhi* too. All that is *sammâdiţţhi* are included in *catusaccasammâdiţţhi*,  and oriented towards it.  Therefore, *sammâdiţţhi* can be classed as follows. 
1. *Kammassakatâ* *sammâdiţţhi* = *Sammâdiţţhi* that realizes the fact that *kamma* is the only possession of yours. 
1) The   *Kammassakatâ* *sammâdiţţhi,* the belief based on knowledge handed down 

from the teachers, a knowledge called *anumâna* *ñâņa*. 

2) The *Kammassakatâ* *sammâdiţţhi* that understands the nature of causal relationship 

of the *dukkha saccâ* and *samudaya saccâ dhammas*  by means of *nâma*-*rûpa* *pariccheda* *ñâņa* and *paccayapariggaha* *ñâņa* acquired through penetrative realization of  

*paccakkha* *ñâņa*. 

2. *Châna* *sammâdiţţhi* = *sammâdiţţhi* that is associated with *châna sammâdi* (belongs to the *ñâņa* that realizes the *dukkha saccâ*). 
2. *Vipassanâ sammâdiţţhi* = the *sammâdiţţhi* *ñâņa* that is associated with *vipassanâ* *ñâņa* which penetratively realizes the nature of *anicca*, *dukkha* and *anatta* of *dukkha saccâ* and *samudaya saccâ dhammas*. 
2. *Magga sammâdiţţhi* = the *ñâņa* that is associated with the *ariya magga*. 
2. *Phalasammâdiţţhi* = the *ñâņa* that is associated with the *ariya phala*. 

The *sammâdiţţhi ñâņa* can grossly be divided into five kinds in this way.  All the five are included in the *catusaccâ sammâdiţţhi*.  These *sammâdiţţhi ñâņa*s are usually  

referred to as *amoha* = *paññâ* (wisdom). 

In  cultivating  a  *kusala  kamma*  (meritorious  deed)  one  should  at  least  have  *Kam- massakatâ* *sammâdiţţhi* acquired through the teachers and which understands the fact that *kamma*  is  the  only  one  you  possess.   If  not  so  and  if  the  right  concept  could  not  be appreciated, then whatever *kusala kamma* you do will only be *ñâvippayutta kusala*.  The consequences of such *kusala*s would result in a dull, dumb, ignorant and inferior  

personality. 

If possible, one should attempt to acquire the *kammassakatâ* *sammâdiţţhi* arising from contemplating on the *nâma-rûpa pariccheda* *ñâņa* and *paccaya pariggaha* *ñâņa*.  If a *kusala kamma* is cultured led by these *ñâņa*s, then it can be a *kamma* of high status.  If that *kamma* produces a result at a certain *bhava* of person, then he would be man of high  

wisdom. 

If  one  is  endowed  with  *jhâna  sammâdiţţhi  ñâņa*,  then  the  *jhâna  kusala  cetanâ*, associated with it, would have the power to produce to attain a high status *byahmâ bhava*.  These *jhâna*s can be maintained, the person can attain the realm of brahma at the time  of  

his death. 

If a *kamma* has been  cultured surrounded by *vipassanâ-sammâdiţţhi ñâņa*, then a noble man among men and noble deity among deities would be the result.  However, it is essential that *rûpa-nâma kammaţţhâna* is concentrated, as mentioned in this doctrine, to the attainment of the ultimate truth and of wisdom.  If such a person perform a *kusala kamma*, such as alms-giving, by 

1. Concentrating by means of analytical knowledge, in his *santâna*, on the three general characters *anicca-dukkha-anatta* of the *rûpa-nâma-paramatta* phenomena, 
1. *Rûpa-nâma-paramatta* in the *santâna* of the alms-receivers, being externally similar, are  collectively  taken  and  contemplated  upon  their  three  characters  by  *vipassanâ ñâņa*, 
1. And if the donated materials discerned in the form of the 4-fold *dhâtus*, *kalâpa* only the atomic particles will be visualized.  These *kalâpa*s are just only the tejo *dhâtu*s located interiorly = *ojaţţhamaka rûpa*s having eight *oja* serially produced  by physical changes (*utu*).  By concentrating on the *ojaţţhamaka rûpa*s after analyzing with the wisdom, and meditating on the three characters of these. 
1. Concentrating  on  *mahâkusala  manodvâravîthi*,  the  *nâma  dhamma*  groups,  led  by  *dâna kusala cetanâ* while exercising *vipassanâ bhâvanâ* on the three characters of these 

If a *dâna kusala* has been cultured surrounded by *vipassanâ* *ñâņa*, then it will be surrounded by the highest *vipassanâ* *ñâņa*.  When it has the chance to express its result in certain *bhava* of a man by virtue of *paţisandhe*, the he will be a man of penetrative and  sharp wisdom. 

The following is an example of sharp *ñâņa* as expounded by the Buddha in Sota- nugata Suttana.  

*So muţţhaassati kâlam*´ *karuņâno aññataram*´ *deva nikâyam*´ *uppajjati*, *tassa tattha sukhito dhammapadâ palavunti*, *danto bhikkhave satuppâdo*, *atha so satto khippanyeva  visesagâmî hoti* (*Am*´-1: 505). 

A certain ascetic failed to attain *magga ñâņa* (Path Knowledge) and *phala ñâņa* (Fruit Knowledge) in spite of hard exercise he made on *vipassanâ bhâvanâ*.  When he expired as an ordinary worldling he arrived, as a *paţisandhe* (*Opapâtikapaţisandhe*), at a certain plane of 

deities.  In the *santâna* of that deity in that plane, where ease of mind prevails, will be *rûpa- nâma-sankhâra dhamma* groups which are the object of *vipassanâ ñâņa* will be conspicuous.  Bhikkûs .. the formation of *sati* (mindfulness) associated with *vipassanâ ñâņa* which can concentrate on these ultimate truth of these *dhamma* groups is still too slow.  In fact, the deity can rapidly attain (the Path Knowledge, and Fruit  

Knoweldge) the Noble *dhamma* called the *nibbâna* (*Am*´-1: 505). 

This is an example of how higher wisdoms are acquired, leading to *nibbâna*, by  cultivating *kamma* surrounded by higher *vipassanâ ñâņa*.   

*Tassa te sotânugatâ hunti vacasâ paricitâ manassânupekkhitâ diţţhiyâ suppaţividdhâ*  (*Am*´-1: 505). 

***Diţţhiyâ suppaţividdhâ**ti atthato ca kâraņato ca paññâya suļu paţividdhâ paccakkham  katâ* (*Am*´-*Ţţha-*2: 505). 

The deity, while existing as an ascetic in the human world, has learned the Buddha’s *dhamma* and recited offhand, understood the real meaning of ultimate truth of the *rûpa* and *nâma*.  He could realize the real causes of the *rûpa* and *nâma* penetratively by means of *sammâdiţţhi  ñâņa*  acquired  through  *sammâdiţţhi  ñâņa  paññâ*.   And  has  acquired  the *vipassanâ  sammâdiţţhi  ñâņa*.    He  was  able  to  exercise  on  the  vipassanâ  *bhâvanâ kammaţţhâna* up till *maraņâsanna javana* (death consciousness).  While doing so his death consciousness is concentrating on the nature of *anicca,* or of *dukkha*, or of  

*anatta* of the *sankhâra dhamma*s as the object. 

The *paţisandhe* (rebirth), *bhavañga* (consciousness of life continuum) and *cuti* (the redeceased) of that deity will use in continuation the near death consciousness of the  

ascetic as the object of concentration. 

As the *bhavañga* of recipient is concentrating on the *sañkhâra dhamma*s, i.e., on  

the nature of either *anicca*, or *dukkha*, or *anatta*, then a *sati* (mindfulness) associated with  *vipassanâ* *ñâņa* which always reflect on those *dhamma* may arise in the *santâna* of deity.  Then the appearance of the *sati* associated with associated with the *vipassanâ* *ñâņa* is still too slow.  In deed, in his *santâna* the ascetic has the consciousness of the *dhamma*s practiced during the life time, and which the are objects of *ârammana* of the *vipassanâ* *ñâņa* – ***pasanne âdâse châyâ viya palavunti, pâkaţâ hutvâ paññâyanti*** (*Am*´-*Ţa*.-2: 2 – 365). 

- The consciousness on the *ârammana* will be clear as mirror images.  Therefore, 

the *nibbâna* is attained rapidly because of slow appearance of the *sati* associated with the *vipassanâ* *ñâņa* which can always concentrate on the *dhamma*s previously practiced. 

It  must  be  noted  that  verbal  recitation  of  “*anicca-dukkha-anatta*”  cannot  the *vipassanâ* *ñâņa* be without realization of true *paramattha rûpa-nâma*.  A *kamma* sur-rounded by false *vipassanâ* *ñâņa*  cannot promote one to a power of great wisdom as the  

one does surrounded by the ture *vipassanâ* *ñâņa*. 

**INDIVIDUAL OF THE FOURTH KIND** 

*Tatthâ yassa kammâyûhanakkhaņe tayopi lobhadosamohâ balavunto hunti*, *alâbhâdayo  mandâ*, *so purimanayeneva luddho ceva hoti duţţho ca mûļho ca* (*Abhi.- Ţţa*.- 1: 308).

Again,  a  certain  individual  might  have  cultivated  a  *kamma*  surrounded  by  *lobha* (greediness), *dosa*, and *moha* in his *santâna*, and which were very lofty at that moment, then the *alobha, adosa* and *amoha* would be weak.   A time would come when that *kamma* has the chance to give its results in a certain *bhava* by virtue of *paţisandhe*, then that person will be of greedy nature.  It is because the *alobha* was too weak to overcome the *lobha*.  *Adosa* was too weak to overcome *dosa*, so that the person will of great anger in nature.  The person will be feeble-minded because the weak *amoha* was unable to over  

come the *moha* (*Abhi.- Ţţa*.- 1: 308). 

Approaching and offering materials to a person known for giving hint on the lucky numbers of a certain raffle, offering flowers, light from an acacia wood and water to the Buddha’s stupas  as instructed by an astrologer etc., are all *kamma*s surrounded by  

*lobha, dosa*, and *moha* dominant over the weak *alobha*, *adosa* and *amoha*. 

**Here  is  a  point  to  consider**.   Observe  carefully  the  Buddha’s  stupas  standing  at  the designated  corners  for  the  purpose  of  receiving  offer  of  water  made  by  people.   On staturdays,  Sundays  and other holidays, there are numerous people at the stupas  for this purpose.  Without any cover overhead, these stupas are all the time in rain or sun light.  As one started making offer of water, others will follow suit in succession.  In this way  

the stupas will be watered throughout the day. 

Think about it deeply.  At home, would you be taking bath all the day?  Only when you  could  imagine  these  stupas  to be  the  real  Buddha,  concentrate  on  his  guna  and  the blessing He has bestowed upon us as the object, then your good deeds would bring forth enjoyable results.  If so, you could think of whether or not the stupas should be  

offered water all the day. 

What is being done is emphasized on what the astrologer has instructed, the element of *alobha* is weak, being considerate on the Buddha = element of *mettâ* also is very weak.  *Amoha* (wisdom) was weak as the interest was only on what the astrologer  

has said,and as the element of wisdom was lacking the real fact of the Buddha has been neglected.  The *kamma* has been made, surrounded dominantly by *lobha*, *dosa*, and *moha*, dominating the *alobha*, *adosa*, and *amoha*, (for purpose of his health, wealth, promotion to higher ranks).   If that kind of *kamma* has the chance to produce result at a certain *bhava*, then the person will be greedy, of great anger and low mentality.  Such a result would arise along as the *alobha*, *adosa*, and *amoha* cannot overcome the *lobha*,*  

*dosa*, and *moha*. 

If a *kamma* has been made and accomplished, all one can do accept its outcome, whatever  the  kind  the  resultant  may  be.   A  *kamma*  once  dome  can  never  be  undone.  However, if *vipassanâ* exercise can be made strenuously, then the *arahatta magga* *ñâņa* would  annihilate  the  results  of  those  *kamma*  following  the  *parinibbâna  cuti*  (complete extinction of *khandhâ*). 

**AN INDIVIDUAL OF THE FIFTH KIND** 

*Yassa pana kammâyûhanakkhaņe alobhadosamohâ balavunto hunti*, *ittare*  

*mandâ*, *so purimanayeneva appakileso hoti dibbârammaņampi disvâ niccalo*, *duţţho pana hoti dandhapañño câti* (*Abhi.-Ţha*.- 1: 309). 

At a moment of culturing a *kamma* surrounded by *alobha*, *dosa* and *moha* will be  dominant over the *lobha*, *adosa* and *amoha* in the *santâna* of a person.  Then, if that *kamma*  produces a result by virtue of *paţisandhe* at a certain *bhava*, the person have little attachment on the material objects.  Even if he can realize the *ârammaņa* that belongs to the deity, he would not be shaken.  In stead, he would lead a tranquil life.  He is free of craving because, when the *kamma* was  made, it was surrounded by  a strong element  of *alobha*.   He is, however, an individual of great hatred, of low mentality and of poor wisdom.  It was because of weak *adosa* and *amoha*, which could not overcome the *dosa*  

and *moha* at the time of culturing the *kamma*. 

**INDIVIDUAL OF THE SIXTH KIND** 

*Yassa pana kammâyûhalakkhaņe alobhâdosamohâ balavunto hunti*, *ittare mandâ*, *so  purimanayeneva aluddho ceva hoti sukasîlako ca*, *danddho pana hoti* (*Abhi.-Ţţa*.- 1: 309) 

At  the  moment  of  culturing  a  *kamma*,  *alobha,  adosa*  and  *moha*  will  be  of  great strength in a person’s *santâna*, dominating over the weak *lobha*, *dosa* and *amoha* at the same moment.  If that *kamma* produces a result by virtue of *paţisandhe* at a certain *bhava*, the person will be non-greedy, of little hatred but of great *mettâ* for which he will be living a peaceful life.  While so cultivating he was relieved of attachment and craving on *karma* objects and of the planes of life as the element of *alobha* was in great strength.  The *kamma* was cultivated surrounded by element of *mettâ*, and therefore element of *adosa* was also of great strength.  Because of the powers of the element *alobha* and *adosa* the person is of non- greedy and of little hatred in nature = a man of great *mettâ* element. When the *kamma* was being cultivated, *ñâņa paññâ* was not included, or weak if included, the weak *amoha* element was not able to get rid of *moha*, the resulting person  

will be of low mentality, deaf and dumb (*Abhi.-Ţţa*.- 1: 309). 

**INDIVIDUAL OF THE SEVENTH KIND** 

*Tathâ yassa kammâyûhalakkhaņe alobhâdosamohâ balavunto hunti*, *ittare mandâ*, *so  purimanayeneva aluddho ceva hoti*, *paññâvâ ca duţţho ca pana hot kodhano* (*Abhi.-Ţha*.- 1: 309).* 

Again at the moment of culturing a *kamma*, *alobha, dosa* and *amoha* are of great strength in a person’s *santâna*.  The *lobha*, *adosa* and *amoha*  all are too weak to express themselves.  If the *kamma*, by virtue of *paţisandhe*, could produce its result at a certain *bhava* of a person, he will be a man of non-greediness, of no attachment to the living and non-living *karma* material and of great wisdom.  It was because while cultivating the *kamma*, it was surrounded by elements of *alobha* and *amoha*.  (It is the kind *kamma* made by a good deed surrounded by elements of *alobha* and *amoha*, similar to *vipassana* *ñâņa* and wishing for *nibbâna*).  While culturing the *kamma*, however, *dosa* elements, such as discontentment, and destructiveness,  were  very  strong.   In  other  words,  he  was  very  short-tempered,  and  the strong dosa could not be overcome by weak *adosa* =  weak *mettâ* could not have overcome the dosa.  If the *kamma* has the chance to produce a result at a certain *bhava*, the person will have mind of destroying others.  (He would have the kind of mind to destroy someone like crushing an ant with ease).  He would be easily annoyed,  

short-tempered and of great anger (*Abhi.-Ţha*.- 1: 309). 

**INDIVIDUAL OF THE EIGHTH KIND** 

*Yassa pana kammâyûhalakkhaņe tayopi alobhâdayo balavunto hunti*, *lobhâdayo mandâ*, *so* “*mahâsangharakkhitattharo viya aluddho aduţţho paññavâ ca hotî”ti*. 

(*Abhi.-Ţha*.- 1: 309). 

While cultivating a *kamma*, a person could have a strong *alobha, adosa*, and *amoha* in his *santâna*, whereas *lobha, dosa* and *moha* were in weak conditions.  When the *kamma* bears its results at a certain *bhava*, the person will have the following features  

like the Rev. Mahâsangha Rakkhata. 

1. He is a person free of greedlessness and of attachment to living and non-living        materials (He can easily be delivered).  (It is due to the power of *alobha*). 
1. He doe not have the will to cause destruction to sentient beings, but have a great *mettâ*, wishing peace and prosperity on them.  He has a mentality of gentle nature.  

(It is due to the power of *adosa*). 

3. He possesses a sharp wisdom.  (It is due to the power of  *amoha* element, such as  *vipassanâ* *ñâņa* the insight knowledge). 

These are due to the powerful elements of *alobha, adosa* and *amoha* at the time of cultivation, and to ability to control his mental processes by means of insight knowledge). 

Such a kind of person is always wishing repeatedly for *nibbâna*, entering the trance to be delivered from the suffering of the sansaric circus, and exercising *vipassanâ* *kammaţţhâņa* based on *mettâ jhâna*. 

**A GOOD CHANCE** 

At this point in time, you are encountering the *sâsanâ* having the following  

advantages: 

1. You are able to listen to and learn the real presence of the *nibbâna*, the element of peacefulness, the *sañkhata dhatu* that can relieve you off the suffering of the *sansarâ vatta*.  
1. You have a chance to listen and realize the 8-fold *Magga*, which are the Paths leading to *Nibbâna*. 
1. There exist *ânâpâna jhâna*, *mettâ jhâna* etc., a feature of nibbâna-achieving exercises.  The doors to contemplation of *ânâpâna jhâna*, *mettâ jhâna* are opened for you. 
1. Based on *ânâpâna jhâna*, *mettâ jhâna*, ways and means of meditation are also  available.  You have, therefore, the chance to attain *vipassanâ* destination. 

**A GREAT WISDOM** 

As a human body is made up of a multitude of *rûpa kalâpa*s  (corporeal units, or subatomic particles) which are of subatomic sizes.  These *kalâpa*s in turn are comprised of at least  8  *rûpa  paramatta*  referred  to  as  *pathavî-âpa-tejo-vâyo-vuņņa-gandha-rasa-ojâ* (composite of earth-water-fire-air-color—smell-taste-nutrient).  In some there are nine *rûpa paramatta* and 10 in still some.  Such statements about the material things had been made over 2500 years ago by the Buddha Sammâsambuddha.  His disciples have been instructed to exerciser on the 8-fold Magga so as to realize these *kalâpas*.  Following these instructions strictly the Venerable Sâriputtarâ and the disciples of innumerable  

numbers have realized the ultimate truth of the *rûpa*. 

Can such a kind of knowledge be acquired outside the Sâsanâ?  Is there any one who can instruct an exercise outside the *Sâsanâ*? The answer is “no.” If a disciple is possessed of such a knowledge by which the physical properties can be discerned on these subatomic particles to ultimate truth by analytical knowledge, then such a  

knowledge is referred to as the ‘great wisdom.’ 

The Buddha’s ways of teaching on the *nâma* *dhamma* are beyond the capability of any preacher, a philosopher or a scientist.  Exercising following the Buddha’s instructions, a disciple may have acquired realization and knowledge on the *nâma* properties, concentrated to  the  attainment  of  the  ultimate  truth  of  the  *nâma*  by  destruction  of  it  by  analytical knowledge, then that knowledge should be regarded as the great  

wisdom too.  

Again,  the  causal  relationship,  the  *paţicca  sammuppâda*,  is  the  preaching  that  is available neither in other religious doctrines, nor in philosophies outside the Sâsanâ.  If a disciple practices following the Buddha’s instructions and penetratively realizes the ultimate truth of causal relationships, then that kind of knowledge must also be regarded  

as the great wisdom.  

The Buddha has expounded the presence of a system of (31) planes, which is referred to as a universe, and existence of innumerable number of universe.  Each (31) planes of the universe is comprised of the following. 

1) A mass of *rûpa dhamma* only (refers to *asaññassata*) 
1) A mass of *nâma dhamma* only (refers to *arûpa* plane = plane of the formless ) 
1) A mass of *rûpa-nâma dhamma* only (refers to *pañcavokâra* plane) 
1) A mass of these *rûpa nâma dhammas*  only (refers to *asaññassata*) 
1) Cause-result phenomena of the *rûpa-nâma* only = *sañkhâra dhamma*s 

The above are 

1) the features of *anicca* (impermanence) *dhamma*s of arising and perishing away, 
1) just the phenomena of formation and dissolution always causing continuous  (*dukkha*) suffering and 
1) *anatta* phenomena (non-self). 

The exercise of 8-fold Megga to acquire the knowledge related to insight knowledge 

Suppose  a  disciple  has  acquired  insight  knowledge  related  to  (*vipassanâ*)  by following instructions given by the Buddha.  This knowledge should also be taken as the  great wisdom, because it cannot be acquired outside the *Sâsanâ*. 

For a disciple the *Magga* *ñâņa* (Path Knowledge) and *Phala* *ñâņa* (Fruit Knowledge), which could penetratively realize the *nibbâna*, are the knowledge that have  

attained their peaks. 

It is, therefore, no wonder that a person would be of great wisdom as a result of  cultivating a *kamma* surrounded by *ñâņa* of great magnitude. 

These are the systems of acquiring knowledge for higher mentality as given in the Buddhist Philosophy. 

THE POWER OF *CITTA* 

(THE MENTAL POWER) 

*Cittena nîyati loko*, *cittena parikassati*. 

*Cittassa ekadhammassa*, *sabbeva vasamanvagû* (*Sam -*1: 36. *Citta suttana*) 

***Cittena nîyatî**ti abhisañkhâraviñâņņam sandhâyâha*,  *tahnâsampayuttam vâ*  (*Mûlaţî-*1: 68) 

*Kusalaviñâņņa*  and  *akusalaviñâņņa*,  which  can  bring  about  a  new  *bhava*,  are  the *abhisañkhâraviñâņņa*.  The *Viñâņņa* associated with *alobha, adosa* and *amoha* the   *abhisañkhâraviñâņņa*.  That which is associated with elements of *lobha* (*tahņâ*), *dosa* and  *moha* is the *akusala abhisañkhâraviñâņņa*.   

The *citta* mentioned in the above *Suttana* refers to the *abhisañkhâraviñâņņa*.   

The  *citta*  element,  called  the  *kusala  abhisañkhâraviñâņņa*  associated  with  the   *alobha, adosa* and *amoha*, have the power to help a sentient being acquire deliverance  

from the *nibbâna* step by step at the consecutive *bhavas*. 

Similarly, the *citta* element, called the *akusala abhisañkhâraviñâņņa* associated with the inferior elements of  *lobha, dosa* and *moha*, have the power to drag down a sentient being dumper and of more inferior mentality step by step at the consecutive *bhavas*. 

All sentient beings in the sansâric circus follow the course made by the *citta* called *kusala abhisañkhâraviñâņņa* and *akusala abhisañkhâraviñâņņa* (*Sam*.-1: 36; *Citta* *Suttana*). 

**EXERCISE YOUR MIND IN THIS WAY** 

*Tassmâhita bhikkhave abhikkhaam sakam cittam paccavakkhitabbam* “*dîgharattamidam cittam samkiliţţham ragena dosena mohenâ*”*ti*.  *Citta samkilesâ bhikkhave sattâ  samkilssanti cittavodânâ sattâ visujjhanti* (*Sam*.-2: 123; *Gaddulabaddha Suttan*). 

Bhikkhûs --- When you are within the *Sâsanâ*, often reflect on your mind and analyze the fact that “throughout day and night our minds are impure because they are tainted with *raga*, *dosa*, and *moha*.”  Because of the impure minds, the sentient beings weary, tired and themselves are unpurified.  The sentient beings of purified mind are  

bright in themselves. (*Sam*.-2: 123; *Gaddulabaddha Suttan*). 

The reason for instruction on such a frequent reflection is that the Lord wanted them to make effort on the exercise of *vipassanâ bhâvanâ*–the actual cause of mind purification.    Such a frequent reflection would help purify the minds by concentrating on the three general characters of the five aggregates, which would otherwise create the 

impure mind by these aggregates. 

**CHANGE YOUR MIND IN CONSTRUCTIVE WAY** 

Concentrate on the facts given above and purify your mind. 

1. ***Niyamita***  –  Fix  your  mind  on  doing  *kusala*  meritorious  deeds  in  your *samatha*, *vipassanâ* etc., as “I shall perform only the *kusala kamma*.” 
1. ***Pariņâmita** –* Refraining from concentrating of  *akusala dhamma*s like *lobha*, *dosa, moha*, conceit, *issâ, micceriya* etc., in mind, but it is made prone to culture of *kusala dhamma*s, such as *samatha vipassanâ*, etc.  
1. ***Sumudâcâra*** – Always practice your mind on *kusala* *dhamma*s, such as *dâna*, *sîla, samatha, vipassanâ, bhâvanâ* etc.. 
1. ***Ãbhujita***  
1) Reside  in  suitable  places,  the  *patirûpa*  locale,  where  benevolent  persons,  or  the Samaritan, prevails. 
1) Approach and make friends with such persons. 
1) Listen to the preaching of benevolent persons. 
1) Cultivate all the Path Knowledge of the Noble ones starting from the Five Precepts that have to be fulfilled prior to attaining the Noble Path. 
1) The  three  periods  the  past,  the  future  and  the  present,  the  five-fold  *uppâdâna*- *kkhandhâ* within the internal and external *santâna* = concentrate and take to heart the *rûpa* and *nâma* as *anicca* (impermanence), *dukkha* (suffering), *anatta* (non-self) and  *asubha*  (repulsive)  repetitively.   If  contemplating  this  way,  which-  ever agreeable or disagreeable objects one may encounter, one would not be  

`  `shaken, and it will always be meritorious deeds. 

Build up your mind in this way.  If built up this, your mind will gradually be purified. With such a gradually purified mind, your *bhava* will become higher and higher, more and more glorified, higher deity and higher *brahmâ* with each existence.  If the purification of mind has resulted in attaining Arahatta-Magga, then you will completely 

be purified and will be delivered from all the worldly affairs. 

If the mind yours has not been purified, but let it be overwhelmed by *lobha*, *dosa*, *moha*, conceit, *issa*, *miccheriya* etc., then you’re your mind element will remain impure.  If such a mind cannot be eradicated in time, it will not stand at *pariyuţţhânakilesâ* (posses sed by  craving)  state,  but  defilement  and  discontentment  so  high  as  to  explode  and  your unbecoming behavior will influence all your speech and acts.  This stage is called *vîtkka-ma- kilesâ* (going beyond *kilesâ*).  Your moral will be broken.  Meritorious deeds such as *dâna* (alms-giving) will be of very inferior quality.  The *dâna* is made with good morality 

will be as follows. 

*Dânañhi loke sakkasampatti, deti mârasampattim cakkavuttisampattim sâvakapâramî-* 

*ñâņam paccekabodiñânam abhisambodhiñânam deti (Am.-Ţha* – 3: 213). 

In this *loka*, *dâna* can result in one of wealth of the King Sakka, of Mâra, of Brahmâ, of *Cakkavaļa* (universal king), in attainment of *sâvaka-pâramî-ñâņa* and of *pac*-*cekabodhi*- *ñâņa*.  *Abhisambodhi ñâņa* (knowledge of the highest enlightenment) = *ara*- 

*hattamagga ñâņa* peaked by *sabbaññuta* *ñâņa* can also be acquired (*Am.-Ţha* – 3: 213). 

The *dâna* (charity/or donation), cultivated based on the *sîla*, can bring forth the wealth of a human king, of a deity, of a brahma and of Cakka on the donor if a wish has been so made.  At certain, when the act of *dâna* has matured to produce a result, the donor will enjoy the relevant results.  If the donor has made a wish for a *bodhiñâņa* such as  *aggasâvaka*- *bodhi*-*ñâņa* or *mahâsâvaka-bodhiñâņa* or *pakatisâva-bodhiñâņa* he would be duly endowed so.  Even *pacceka-bodhiñâņa* can be acquired if it has been wished for.  This donation will be of  support  in  acquiring  *sabbaññuta*-*ñâņa*  (knowledge  of  omniscience)  =  *sammâ- sambodhiñâņa* like the hermit Sumedhâ and the king Vessanta-râ, if it has been the wish.  Among the 10 *pârâmî*s (the ten perfections), *dâna* is a part.   

The power of *dâna*, therefore, is of great magnitude. 

*Tañca kho sîlavato vadâmi*, *no dussîlassa*.  *Acchati bhikkhave sîlavato cetopaņidhi  visuddhattâ* (*Am.-*3-71*. Dânûpapatti Suttana*). 

I preach to only those with *sîla* (morality) that the powerful *dâna* give resultants of high quality, but not to those without such *sîla*.  Bhikkûs ---- in those with *sîla*, their minds are clear because of the clear *sîla*, and whatever wishes they have in their minds  

are definitely fulfilled (*Am.*-3-71). 

**HOW BRAHMA’S WEALTH CAN BE ACQUIRED** 

With regard to the *dâna* producing the wealth of Brahma, the following have been  given in the texts. 

*Tañca kho sîlavato vadâmi*, *no dussîlassa*.  *Vitarâgassa*, *no tarâgassa* (*Am.*-3-72).* 

***Vitarâgassâ**ti maggena vâ samucchinnarâgassa sammâpattiyâ vâ vikkhambhi tarâgassa*. *Dâna matteneva hi brahmâ-loke nibbattiton na sakkâ*, *dânam pana sammâdhivipassanâ-*

*cittassa alañkâraparivâram hoti*.  *Tato dânena muducitto brahmavihâre bhâvattvâ* 

` `*brahma-loke nibbattati*.  *Tena vuttam “vitarâgassa*, *no sarâgassâ”ti* (*Am.*- *Ţha*.- 3-230). 

The *anâgâma* (the never-returner) the noble one could eradicate the attachment on the various *rûpa*-*kamma* material of living and non-living materials in (11) *rûpa* planes  

by  virtue  of  *anâgâmi*-*magga*-*ñâņa*.   It  is  the  *samuccheda*-*pahâna*  (a  way  of  abandoning through full understanding of the noble truth of suffering and its ceasing).  The noble ones such as the worldling with high morality, *sotapanna* (the up-streamer), *sagadâgâmi* (once- returner), can detach themselves for a considerable duration of time from these *karma*-*râga* through the power of absorption or trance = this is the way of detachment by  

*vikkhambhana*. 

The Buddha expatiated that the wealth of brahma king can be acquired only by those possessed of *sîla*, and relieved of raga by way of *samuccheda* and *vikkhambhana*. In those with *sîla*, their minds are clear because of the clear *sîla*, and whatever wishes they have in their minds are completely fulfilled.  What it means is that *dâna* alone could not help acquire the life in byahma world.  It, however, can be the features of *samaţţha bhâvanâ-citta and vipassanâ bhâvanâ-citta* referred to as *samâdhi* (concentration).   By performing *dâna* one’s mind becomes softened. And if the *byama*-*vihâra*  (the 4 sublime states) of *mettâ*, *karuņâ*, *muditâ* and *uppekkhâ* = the 4-fold *byamacora*, can be acquired, then this *jhâna dhamma* will enable one to relieve himself of *râga* etc., the *ņîvaran* impurities by virtue of *vikkhambhana*.  Because  of  the *raga*-free  *byama*-*vihâra* *jhâna*,  he  can  attain  an  existence  in  the byahma world.    Therefore, I only preach to the “one free of *raga* the way of attaining an existence in the byahma world; but to the one who is not  

freed of *râga*” (*Am.*- *Ţha*.- 3-230).  

If such highly *dâna* cannot be made based on the *sîla*, then there can be no higher resultants, instead only inferior results can be obtained from such a *dâna*.  With reference  

to this assertion, read the following *Aņusoņi-suttanna*. 

***AŅUSOŅI SUTTANA*** 

Then  *Jânusoņi*,  the  royal  astrologer  of  the  King  Bembisâra,  approached,  had  a memorable talk with the Buddha and took a seat at an appropriate location and said to the Lord. 

My  Lord  Gotama  ---  we  humble *puņņa*s  made *dâna*  with  the  intention  that  “this donation would reach our relatives who have passed away, and that they be able to utilize its benefit.”  We made kumbi-rice in remembrance of them.  My Lord Gotama ---- would  

our donation reach our relatives and could they enjoy these? 

The Buddha replied.  Donor *puņņa*s ---- it arrives at places where it should, but  not at places where it should not.  

My Lord Gotama, asked the *puņņa*s --- 

1) What is the place where it should arrive and 
1) That where it should not? 
1. In this *loka* some people used to take the life of other living beings, some take what is not given, indulged in adultery, tell lies, slander, speak harsh (impolite) speech, frivolous and senseless talk, covetousness, malevolence and practiced *micchâdiţţhi* (wrong view) doctrine.  After ageing, death and decay the person would attain a life in the world of misery.  He has to share the food meant for the being of that world.  He has to live on such food lead an existence in that world.  This is the place where the benefit of *dâna* could not reach, and the that individual of the miserable world could not enjoy the result  

of that *dâna*. 

[***Nerayikânam âhâro nâma** tattha nibbattanakammameva*.  *Teneva hi te tattha yâ panti* ((*Am.*- *Ţţa*.- 3-338).  The *âhâra* of those in the miserable world is that which is 

` `made available in that world.  They have to share such *âhâra* among themselves.] 

2. Dâyakâ (donor) *puņņa* --- in this world there some who take other’s life. R.  They have the wrong of view of *micchâdiţţi*.  After death and decay, he would attain an existence in animal world, sharing feeds with other animals.   He has to remain as an animal in the same world.  Then this still is not yet the place where *dhâna* could arrive at.   

It would reach those existing as animal in an animal world. 

[***Tiracchânayonikânam** pana tiņņapaņņâdivasena âhâro veditabbo* (*Sam*.- *Ţha*.-  3: 338).  The food of animals is made of grass vegetables.] 

3. Dâyakâ  *puņņa* --- In this *loka* some abstain from taking life, from taking what is not given,  from   indulging  in  adultery,  from  telling  lies,  from  slander,  from  speaking  harsh speech, from frivolous and senseless talk, from covetousness, from malevolence and from practicing *micchâdiţţhi* doctrine.  They are relieved of *abhicchâ* (frugality) and of intention to destroy sentient beings and *sañkhâra*, has the right view (*sammâdiţţhi*).  When such a person succumb to death and decay, he would acquire human life.  He would have the *âhâra* like other humans leading a life as a human being.    This is still not a place for *dâna* to reach nor could he, as a human being, could enjoy the results of  

that *dâna*. 

4. Dâyakâ  *puņņa* --- In this *loka* some abstain from taking life.  R.  He possesses *samm*- *âdiţţhi* view.  After death and decay, he would acquire a deity’s existence.  He co-exists with the deities living on the food of gods (*sudhâ*).  Again this neither the right place to  

which the results of *dâna* could arrive at nor the person who could enjoy the result. 

5. Dâyakâ  *puņņa* --- In this *loka* some abstain from taking life.  R.  He possesses *samm*- *âdiţţhi* view.  After death and decay, he would acquire a (*peta*’s) life in *peta*’s realm.  He would  co-exist  with  other  *peta*’s  living  on  their  nutrition,  or  on  the  *dâna*  given  by  his relatives and the loved ones for his own benefit.  Dâyakâ  *puņņa* --- This the right place to which benefits of *dâna* would reach, and person who could enjoy the results. [***Pettivesayikânam** khe*3*asañghâņikâdivasena*.  ***Yam vâ panassa ito anuppavacchantî**ti yam tassa mittâdayo ito  dadantâ anupavesañti*, *pettivesdanikâ ve hi paradattûpajîvino*  

*hunti*, *na aññesam parehi uppakappati* (*Sam*.-*Ţha*.- 3: 338 - 339). 

The nutrition of the *petâ*s, in fact, are human refuse.  If their loved ones have made a *dâna* for their sake,  then they would enjoy it as if it were that of deities.  These *petâ*s are of *paradattûpajîvita* ( living on what is given by others) kind.  Others such as *nicchâmâdahņika* could not enjoy the result of such *dâna*.  Then the *dâna* cannot reach to  

such *peta*s.] 

Then the *puņņa* once again enquired.  My Lord Gotama ---- If that *dâna* failed to reach to such *peta*s, then who would enjoy the benefit of that *dâna*? 

The Lord Gotama replied.  Dâyakâ  *puņņa* --- To the relatives who have attained the *peta*s’ existence in their realm. 

If our relatives and others who have, after death and decay, do not reach the *petâ*’s realm  who would enjoy the results of our *dâna*? 

Dâyakâ  *puņņa* --- During the long journey through the sansâric circus, reaching or not reaching the *petâ*’s realm is not an important fact.  In other words (***Apîca byahma-*** 

***ņa dâyakopi anipphaloti***) = the donor, indeed, cannot be without benefit. 

[***Dâyakopi anipphalo**ti yam sandhâya tam dânam dannam*, *tassa upakappatu vâ mâ vâ*,  *dâyakena  pana  na  sakkâ  nipphalena  bhavitom*,  *dâyako  tassa  dânassa  vipâkam labhatiyeva* (*Sam*.-*Ţha*.- 3: 338 - 339).   What is meant by the fact that the donor is not without benefit is that a *dâna* that was made for the benefit of those who have perished  

away may or may not reach them, the donor still enjoys the results of *dâna*]. 

The *puņņa* enquired of the Buddha … “If the death ones acquired a life at a realm where the results of the *dâna* could not arrive at, do you my Lord Gotama still  

recommend the benefit of the *dâna*?” 

Yes Dâyakâ  *Byamana* --- I do. 

[The *Byamana* seems to be under the impression that “the *dâna* made for the benefit of those who have passed away could not be enjoyed by the donor himself. The Lord agreed with *puņņa* and expounded in continuation that “if the donor happens to acquire a life where one can enjoy the results of *dâna*, then he can enjoy the benefit the  

*dâna* (*Sam*.-*Ţha*.- 3: 338 - 339)]. 

1. Dâyakâ …. In this world, there are some who used to take other’s life, take what is 

not given, indulge in *karma*s, tell lies, gossip, make harsh speak, frivolous talks.  They are attached to living and non-living karma materials of the others, have the mind  

set on destroying sentient beings, and practice *micchâdiţţhi vâda*. 

He is used to offer foods, soft drinks, clothes, vehicle, flowers, scents, place to  sleep and light to *samaņa* or *brâhmaņa*. 

After death and decay, he acquired the life of an elephant.  In that life he could  enjoy food, flowers and special decoration meant for elephants. 

Dâyakâ …. In this existence, taking other’s life, taking what is not given, indulging in *karma*s, lying, gossiping, making harsh speak, frivolous talks, being attached to living and non-living karma materials of the others, have the mind set on destroying 

sentient beings, and practice *micchâdiţţhi vâda*, would result in him acquiring the life an elephant. 

Because of offering foods, soft drinks, clothes, vehicle, flowers, scents, place to  sleep and light to *samaņa* or *brâhmaņa*, that person would enjoy the foods, flowers and special decoration meant for elephants. 

2. Dâyakâ  *puņņa* ….  In this world, there are some who used to take other’s life. R. 

He is used to offer foods, soft drinks, clothes, vehicle, flowers, scents, place to sleep 

and light to *samaņa* or *brâhmaņa*. 

` `After death and decay, he acquired the life of a horse.  R. 

3. After death and decay, he acquired the life of a cow.  R. 
4. He acquired the life of a dog after death and decay,.  R. 

Dâyakâ  *Byamana* ….  due to taking other’s life in this existence, R, and practice  *micchâdiţţhi vâda*, he would acquire an existence as (a horse, a cow) and a dog. 

Because of offering foods, clothes, vehicles, flowers scent and comfortable   sleeping place and light to the *samaņa*s or *brâhmaņa*s, he could enjoy the life of (a  horse, a cow) a dog with foods and decorations. 

[N.B.  The *Suttana* has not ended yet, but is paused for a while to explain its meaning so far.  As explained above, the power of *dâna* made on the basis of *sîla*, could provide the donor with comforts of human kings, of deities, of brâhma and cakkavade; the *eggasâvaka bodhi  ñâņa*,  *mahâsâvaka  bodhi  ñâņa*,  *pakatisâvaka  ñâņa*,  *pacceka  bodhi  ñâņa*,  or *sammâsambodhi ñâņa*.  The power of such a magnitude is resulting at the right place at the right time.  In the present section (*suttâna* so far), the power of *dâna* made on the basis of *ducarita* (misbehavior), referred to as damaged *sîla*, could not provide wealth  as above nor the higher *ñâņa*s.  Instead, the *dâna*’s results made their appearance in the wrong place like 

the lower world of sentient beings.  Though they  can enjoy the life of graceful elephant or horse or higher status cow, but not the comfort enjoyed by human kings, deities, brâhma. And the  nutrition  consumed  by  such  beings  are  just  the  *tiņapņņâ-divasena*  –  vegetables  as mentioned  in  *Aţţhakathâ*.   Such  food,  when  compared  to  that  of  human  kings,  deities, brâhma,  are  of  very  inferior  quality.   As  a  dog,  it  can  sleep  on  good  gunny  bag  like  a mattress, and can have good food, it has live in an abode suitable for a dog.  The food may be good for a dog, but has to live in places lower than human kings etc.  As the village pigs like human  organic  refuse  so  do  the  dogs.   For  this  reason,  the  donor  who  has  acquired  an animal’s life, the food they eat and place they live may be of higher status for animals.  But this situation could not be compared to those of human kings, deities etc.  The animals have to contend with grass and other vegetables as their food, and ground as their living places.  This is an instance of *dâna* resulting in the wrong place, a result that can be enjoyed by immoral  personalities.   Care  should  be  exercised  on  these  situations.   Then  the  Buddha continued expatiation for the *Jâņusoņipoņņa* as given  

below.] 

5. Dâyakâ  *Byamana* ….  In this life some abstain from taking other’s life.  R.  Practice a *sammâdiţţhi vâda* (the doctrine of the right view).  He would offer as donation the foods,  clothes, vehicles, flowers scent and comfortable sleeping place and light to the *samaņa*s or *brâhmaņa*s.  After death and decay, he would attain the plane of human beings, and as  

a human he would possess the five-fold clinging to the corporeality. 

Dâyakâ  *Byamana* ….  He is possessed of the five-fold clinging to the corporeality because of attaining a human life, after death and decay, as a result of  

abstaining from taking other’s life and practicing a *sammâdhiţţhi vâda*. 

[*So tam cittam dahati*, *tam cittam adhiţţhâti*,*tam cittam bhâveti*.  *Tassa tam cittam hîne  vimuttam uttari abhâvitam tattarûpapattiyâ samvuttati* (*Am*.-3: 71). 

That donor of morality  has mind set on becoming a rich king or a rich *puņņa* or a rich Gahapati and has his mind cultivated in that way.  He concentrated his mind on that wish repetitively.  His mind leaning towards the five-fold clinging to the corporeality, his failure to concentrate on attaining the *magga*, *phala*, *nibbâna*, higher than the above five, 

on the, are the causes that have resulted in rebirth among the beings he had wished for.   

Note that the same applies to attaining the deity’s *bhava*, etc.]   

6. Dâyakâ  *Byamana* …. In this life some abstain from taking other’s life.  R.  Practice a *sammâdiţţhi vâda* (the doctrine of the right view).  He would offer as donation the foods,  clothes, vehicles, flowers scent and comfortable sleeping place and light to the *samaņa*s or *brâhmaņa*s.  After death and decay, he would attain the realm of deities, and as a deity 

he would possess the five-fold clinging to the corporeality. 

Dâyakâ  *Byamana* ….  He is possessed of the five-fold clinging to the corporeality because of attaining a deity’s life, after death and decay, as a result of  

abstaining from taking other’s life and practicing a *sammâdhiţţhi vâda*. 

Dâyakâ *Byamana* ….  Indeed the donor cannot be without merit, he does enjoy  the benefit the *dâna*,  the Lord replied. 

The *Jâņusoņipoņņa* declared as: 

My Lord Gotama …. It is wonderful.  It has never occurred in me before. 

My Lord Gotama ….  Since the donor is not without benefit, one should offer  dâna.  Kubbhi rice (= to give alms with intended benefit for the death) is worth making. 

Dâyakâ  *Byamana* ….  So it is, and so it should be. 

Dâyakâ  *Byamana* ….  The donor will never be without benefit.  The Buddha  

expounded. 

My Lord Gotama …. Your explanatory *dhamma*s are very beautifully put to me.  If I may compare your *dhamma*s to worldly affairs, it is like putting something right that has been upside down, like lifting the lid of post, showing the right way to one who has lost his way, like giving light to people “of good vision expecting to visualized material features,” groping in the dark.   You have explained competently with many an examples. 

My Lord Gotama …. we take refuge in You, in your *dhamma*s, referred to as the 10-fold Magga-Phala-Nibbâna-Dammakkhan, and in Eight Noble Sanghâs.  I humbly request that I be recognized as an Upâsakâ and a Dâyakâ who respects and  pay homage to the Three-  

fold *Yatanâ* from now on until my death (*Am*.-3:478 – 482). 

**A FEW EXCEPTIONS** 

The donor must be complete with the following four-fold features: 

1. *Dussîla* = person without morality 
1. Material donated were obtained by illegal means 
1. With clear mind 
1. No belief in the broad and higher *dhamma*s of kamma-and-its-effect 

But the person of receiving end must have the following feature: 

5. Person of high morality. 

Such a kind of *dâna* is also clean because of the morally high receiving person, and is of great benefit as expounded by the Buddha in *Dakkhiņavibañga Suttâna* (*Ma*.-3:300). 

The *Aţţhakathâ* has depicted a fisherman living at the mouth of River *Kalyâņî* as an example.  The fisherman  has offered alms to Dîghasoma Mathera for three times.  At the moment of death consciousness, he had the *Maraņâsanna jhâna* (impulsion of near-death) of that alms-giving, declared “I have been relieved of miserable world, that could  

have resulted from the *akusala*-*kamma*, just before he succumbs to death (*Ma*.-3:227). 

These are just few instances of exception.  Because of  the receiving person being an individual of clean sîla, like the Rahntâ Matheras, having immense *guņa*, and which has the chance to provide result, that the fisherman was relieved of *apâya*.  Though the previous cause has given result, that *kamma* (action) has been surrounded by fore and aft,  

it is a *kamma* of inferior quality.  This kind of chance, however, is hard to come by.  Until the time when that *kamma* is matured and has the time produce results,  the *âciņņa* *kamma* (chronic *kamma*) killing fish by fisherman would have a better chance to provide  

its results.  

You as gentleman should culture clean and high element of mind: 

1. If you wish to be delivered from the *apâya*, 
1. If you wish to lead the life of a high status human, deity  and brâhma, 
1. If you wish to be relieved of sufferings of sansâric circus. 

*Sabbapâpassa akaraņam*, *kusalassa upasampadâ*. *Sacittapariyodapanam*, *etam buddhânasâsanam* (*Dî*.-2:42).*  

1. Abstain from doing *akusala* (non-meritorious deeds) *kamma*. 
1. Make every effort to perform *kusala* (meritorious) *kamma*. 
1. Make clean your mind (or consciousness) by washing stepwise in *magga* and        *phala* cleaners. 

These are admonitions (axioms) provided by all Buddhas (*Dî*.-2:42). Translated by KMA, Mandalay. 

SECTIONS ON *IRIYÂPATHA* AND *SAMPAJAÑ* MEDITATION BY *IRIYÂPATHA* AND *SAMPAJAÑÑA* 

In the section on *rûpa*-*kammaţţhâna*, contemplation of corporeal *iriyâpatha* and of *sampajañña* have been mentioned.  In the present section *nâma kammaţţhâna* mention will be made of concentration the fivefold *khandhâ* (clinging aggregates).   Before going on to this section, the reader is advised to understand, reflect and concentrate on explanations given in *rûpa*-*kammaţţhâna*.  Only then will deep realization and  

contemplation be made on *nâma kammaţţhâna*. 

**THE FOUR KINDS OF *RÛPA*-*KÂYA*** 

` `*Tattha catubbidho kâyo upâdinnako âhârasamuţţhâno utusamuuţţhâno cittaţţhânoti*.  *Tattha cakkhâyatnâdîni jîvitindariyapariyantâni aţţha kammasamuţţhânarûpânîpi*,  *kammasamuţţhânâneva catasso dhâtuyo vuņņo gandho raso ojâti aţţha **upâdinnakakâyo** nâma*.  *Tâ neva aţţha âhârajâni **âhârasamuţţhânikakâyo** nâma*.  *Aţţha utujâni **utusamuuţţhânikakâyo** nâma*, *aţţha cittajâni **cittasamuţţhânikakâyo** nâma* (*Abhi*.- *Ţha*.- 1:124). 

1. ***Upâdinnakakâya* –** *kamma*-*samuţţhâna* (*kamma*-caused) modes of eight kinds 

*cakkhâyatana, sotâyatana*, *ghânâyatna*, *jîvhâyatana*, *kâyâyatana*, *itthibhâva-rûpa*, *pûrisabhâvarûpa*, *and jîvitindare* (9 kinds if *hadayavutthu* is also included), and the eight modes of *rûpa* such as *pathav*î, *âpo*, *tejo*, *vâyo*, *vuņņa*, *gandha*, *rasa* and *ojâ*, also *kamma*- *samuţţhâna*, are said to be ***Upâdinnakakâya*.**  [It means that the *kamma* “I, My  

benefit” associated with or surrounded by *taņhâ-diţţhi*.] 

2. ***Ãhârasamuţţhânikakâya*** – The eight modes of *rûpa* such as *pathavî*, *âpo*, *tejo*,*   *vâyo*,*vuņņa*, *gandha*, *rasa* and *ojâ*, are said to be ***Ãhârasamuţţhânikakâya***. 
2. ***Cittasamuţţhânikakâya*** –** If the above eight modes are *citta*-derived ones, then they  
\***
`     `are said to be ***cittasamuţţhânikakâya***. 

[Note – The descriptions above are for *Rûpa*-*kâya* = the ever occurring in *khandhâ* called *rûpa-rûpa*, all caused bythe four dhammas including *kamma* etc., the true *rûpa*s.  The sadda-rûpa which occur once in a while, and the *nipphanna*-*rûpa* which are  

not true *rûpa*s are not inclusive.] 

**THE *KÂYAVIÑÑATA-RÛPA*** 

In  this  *iriyâpatha*  and  *sampajañña*  contemplations,  understanding  of  *kayaviññata*- *rûpa* is a pre-rerquisite.  In the previous section on *rûpakamaţţhâna* detail explation on the *viññata-rûpa* has been made.  For the sake of rememberance it will be touched upon  

again in brief. 

What is *kâyaviññata*-*rûpa*?  It is the *rûpa* referred to as the *kayaviññata*.  There is dhamma rooted in *kusala*-*citta*, *akusala*-*citta*, *abyâkata*-*citta*, and of individuals of advancing or retreating, of seeing straight ahead or sideways,  of flexing or extending legs, *rûpa*-*kâya dhamma*s = supporting all *rûpa* dhamma, the cause of such a support  

*rûpa*, that which makes one realises (*Abhi*.- 1: 177).  

If consciousness arsies in one as “I will go forward, or backward,” it is the cause of arising of the *cittaja*-*rûpa* (a multitude of *cittaja*-*kalâpa*).  Each and every *kalâpa* has the four great elements: *pathavî*, *âpo*, *tejo,vâyo*.  Among these are included the four great  element-depended *vuņņa*, *gandha*, *rasa* and *ojâ*, called *upâdâna rûpa*, and also the eight modes of the *rûpa dhamma*.  Included also in these *rûpa dhamma*s is *cittasamuţţhâna vâyo dhâtu*.   This  *vâyo  dhâtu*  with  *upâdinnakâya*,  *âhârasamuţţhâni  kâya*,  *utusamuţţhânikâya*, *cittasamuţţhânikâya*,  which  are  the  *rûpa-kâya*s  =  *all  the  rûpa  dhammas*  formed  together* within a *khandhâ*, provide good support, and cause  

movements forward or backward (*Abhi*.- *Ţha* 1: 124). 

Among the *cittaja vâyo dhâtu*, arising from that *citta*, are *manodvârika-jhâna-vîthi* with a certain *âvajjana* of the seven *javana*s.  Of these seven, *vâyo-dhâtu* formed of the first *javana*-*citta* has ability to support, maintain and hold firmly *catuja-rûpa-kâya*. It is, therefore unable move this way or that.  Note that the same hold true for second  

*jhâna* and so on. 

The *vâyo  dhâtu*  contained  in *cittaja  rûpa*  *kalâpa*s  caused by  seventh *javana-citta* formed previously = included in the 6-fold prior *jhâna-citta* derived *cittaja rûpa* *kalâpa*s produces supportive *upatthambhana* cause.  Because of this support, it can provide good support to *catuja-rûpa-kâya* of similar nature = for the purpose of propping up, good and firm maintenance, of movement, of moving to and fro, of looking straight ahead, of glancing sideways, flexing and extending.  Because of the 7th *jhâna-citta*-derived *vâyo*- 

*dhâtu*, the following can exclaimed to have attained. 

`      `Going forward, 

`      `Turning back, 

`      `Going and coming back. 

To have traveled a distance of one *yûjanâ* To have traveled a distance of ten *yûjanâ*. 

The *rûpa dhamma*s once arisen, as *uppâda*, at place is never removed to another one.  The life span of a *rûpa dhamma* only 17 *citta khana*s (thought moment), so short a duration that it perishes away at the place of arising.  The movement here means the arising a *rûpa- kalâpa* at one place and arising once again in another.  It is not the movement of *rûpa*-*kalâpa* per se from one place to another.  Arsing in another place is by virtue of the *vâyo dhâtu* included among the *cittaja*-*rûpa* *dhâtu*.  People take *uppâda*  

shifting from one place to another as “movement.” 

The *vâyo dhâtu* contained in the *cittaja*-*rûpa-kalâpa*s, derived from the first *javana- citta*, in fact, cannot move at the moment of arising as a cause for *catuja-rûpa at* a certain other place.  However immovable it mat be, it must be noted that the *vâyo dhâtu* arises together with the *vikâra*-*rûpa* called *viññatta*.  (It means that it formed as *kâyaviññattinavaka kalâpa*, *kâyaviññattinavaka-lahuta dvidvâdasaka kalâpa*). 

The reason is this.  Of the 10 directions, you would like to go to certain direction, or to put a cerain thing, to flex or extend, then the *vâyo dhâtu* would well support and maintain the *catuja*-*rûpa,* which are bearing direction.  Therefore, the feature of being directed to a particular place is there, a distinct feature arising together with your internal state of mind *chanda* = the *vikâra* is also a form of *viññatta*.  Note, therefore, that among the first javana- derived *cittaja-rûpa*-*kalâpa*, *vâyo dhâtu* is formed together with *vikâra*-*rûpa*, called *viññatta*.    

Because of this, the appearance also of *viññatta-rûpa* by the *manodvâra* form the distinct *vikâra*-*rûpa* according to the internal *chanda* (the particularly distinct *vikâra*-*rûpa* in accordance with the *chanda*).  Because of this possibility of formation of  *vuţţho*, *karma*- *javana*, *abhiññâna*-*jhâna*, the 32 modes  of *citta*s as strengthening the *cittaja*-*sâmañña*-*rûpa*, as well as the *iriyaputta* and the appearance of *viññatta-rûpa*. 

Among the inumerable *cittaja*-*rûpa*-*kalâpa* that have  arisen, the *vâyo*-*dhâtu* couldbe claimed to have a place 10 *yûjanâ*s away (*Mulaţî*.- 1: 72). 

Among the *catuja rûpa*-*kâya* = *catusamuţţhânika rûpa-kâya* = the *rûpa-kâya*s are present all the *cittaja*-*rûpa*s referred to as *cittajasamuţţhânika kâya*, but are not the *viññatta*. As  a  matter  of  fact,  for  supporting  the  among  the *citta*-caused  *catuja  rûpa*-*kâya*  formed together with *vâyo dhâtu*, included in the *cittajasamuţţhâni rûpa-kalâpa*s, = for firm prop, strong maintenance, moving here and there, which can be the causes, there is present a certain feature of *citta*-derived *mahâbhûta* (the four great primaries) *cittajasamuţţhâna*.  This distinct feature is the ***viññatta*** (*Abhi*.- *Ţha.* 1: 125). 

Note that it is true that because of the possession of such distinct feature, the *vâyo* *dhâtu*,  formed  together  with  *catuja  rûpa*-*kâya*  =  all  the  *rûpa*s,  can  support  and  move (*Mahâţî*.- 1: 72). 

*Cittaja-aţţhakalâpa rûpa*s arises due to citta, but not the *viññatta*-*rûpa*.  (Because it is not  the  true  *paramatta*).  In  this  way,  *sañkhâra  paramatta  dhammas*,  though  not  the *cittajasamuţţhâna* the *citta*-derivatives, have the nature of *anicca* (impermanence), *dukkha* (suffering) and *anatta* (non-self), and are subject to *jarâ*-*mara* (ageing and death). 

***Jarâ-Maraņam bhikkhave aniccam sañkhatam*** (*Sam*.-1: 264) 

Bhikkhûs … *Jarâ*-*maraņa* is an *anicca dhamma* (phenomenon of impermanence); its causes  are  the  *sañkhata  dhamma*  subject  to  change.   Besides,  the  *vikâra*,  referred  to  as *viññatta*, which can realize the *cittaja*-*rûpa*, and which are the *cittajasamuţţhâna* = having a particular behavior *viññatta*-*rûpa* also is *citta*-caused *cittajasamuţţhâna* (*Abhi*.-*  

*Ţha.* 2: 125).   

***Ţhânupacâ***.  From the *Aţţhakathâ* descriptions, the *cittajasamuţţhâna* the true name, of the eight modes of the *kalâpa*-*rûpa*, has been emphasized on the basis of *vikâra*-*rûpa* *viññatta*, and is also *cittajasamuţţhâna*.  For this reason, that *viññatta rûpa* has to be*  

named as the *cittajasamuţţhâna* by way of an explanation inserting as *nâma saddâ* hence the expression “***Sâpi cittasamuţţhânâ nâma hoti*** (*Abhi*.- *Ţha.* 2: 125). For the purpose of making clear that there, however, is no *viññatta*-*rûpa* in *paramatta* sense.  This is  

explained to be “ ***Na cittasamuţţhânâ.***” 

` `From aspect of the *ţhânupacâra* the *viññatta*-*rûpa* is the *cittajasamuţţhâna* and is also *upâdâ rûpa* from aspect of the four-fold *mahâbhûta*  = because of being *vikâra* by  

way of *ţhânupacâra* (*Mahâţî*.-1: 72). 

As explained previously in section on *rûpa*-*kammaţţhânâ*, two *rûpa*s in this *iriya*- *patha* and *sampajañña* are given below. 

1. ***Padhâna*** (essential) = the concentrated *rûpa dhamma*s are the *kâya*-*viññatti navaka kalâpa*  

and *kâya*-*viññatti-lahutâ dvidvâdasaka kalâpa* which the two kinds of *cittaja*-*rûpa*  

*kalâpa* in which is included the *viññatta*.  *Bhasite* – *sampajañña* meditation are two *rûpa kalâpa*s: *vacîiññatti*-*daska kalâpa* and *vacîiññatti sadda-lahutâditerasaka kalâpa*, included in the *vacîññatta rûpa,* which made their appearance because of consciousness  

on point of wish to make while talking. 

2. ***Appadhâna*** (nonessential) = *apadhâna rûpa dhamma*s are *catusamuţţhânika*  

*rûpa-kâya =* all the *rûpa* *dhamma*s located in the six *dvâra*s and the 42 *kuţţhâsa* (the bodily parts) of the body (*Ma*.- *Ţî.-* 353). 

1. Among these *padhâna*-*rûpa* and *apadhâna*-*rûpa*, a meditator concentrates primarily on the *rûpa dhamma*s inclusive of *viññatta rûpa* referred to as *iriyapaţha-rûpa*.  If he did so, the *catusamuţţhânika rûpa-kâya* located in the *dvâra*s and the 42 *kuţhâsa*, which are 

the *appadhâna* = all the *rûpa dhamma*s too are completely cultured. 

2. *Appadhâna*.  Non-concentrated *samuţţhânika rûpa-kâya*, located in the six *dvâra*s and the 42 *kuţhâsa*, = contemplation on all *rûpa dhamma*s as the primary objects, also *iriya*-*paţţha- rûpa*, the *appadhâna* are accomplished consecutively.  Later,  *samuţţhânika rûpa-kâya* is the *padhâna*, *iriyapaţha-rûpa* = *cittaja rûpa*s which contain *viññatta*, are the 

` `*appadhâna* (*Ma*.- *Ţî.-* 353). 

All these *padhâna*, *appadhâna rûpa dhamma*s are called the *rûpa*-*kkhandhâ*.  The meditator must have cultured all these to the  attainment of realizing their *paramatta* ( the ultimate truth).  Only then can the attainment of *nâma dhamma*s be cultured.  For the sake of relationship concentrations on the *rûpa* and *nâma dhamma*s, a brief description of  

that on the *rûpa dhamm*a, that has been broadly explained previously, will be made. 

**THE FIVE-FOLD *KHANDDHÂ*** = ***RÛPA* + 2 MODES OF *NÂMA*** (The Five Aggregates = Corporeality + 2 Mental States) 

“*Gicchâmî*”*ti cittam uppajjati*, *tam vâyam janeti*, *vâyam janeti*, *citta-kiriya vâyodhâtu- vipphârena-sakalakâyassa pûrato abhinîhâro gamananti vuccati*.  *Thânâdîsupi eseva*  

*nayo* (*Ma*.- *Ţha.*- 1: 256). 

***Vâyam janetî**ti vâyo-dhâtu-adhikam rûpa-kalapam janeti* (*Ma*.- *Ţha.*- 1: 352). 

A *citta* willing to go arises, which causes arising of a *vâyo*-*dhâtu* = resulting in in a *rûpa*-*kalâpa* under influence of natural power natural power = causes arising of all the *rûpa dhamma*s.   This  *vâyo*-*dhâtu*  causes  arsing  of  *viññatta*-*rûpa*..   because  of  the  spread throughout the entire body of the *vâyo*-*dhâtu* caused by *citta*, in other words, due to spread throughout the entire body of the citta-caused natural power overwhelmed by *rûpa dhamma*s, complete *sammuţţhâna rûpa*-*kâya* = all *rûpa-dhamma*s are carried forwards.   

The same applies to their stoppage etc.*  (*Ma*.- *Ţha.*- 1: 256). 

You are advised to carefully read the descriptions in the above *Aţţhakathâ*. 

1. To begin with, the will to go should be concentrated to realize by eye of wisdom. 
1. Concentration should be made to visualize, by eye of wisdom, on the complete *rûpa*- *kalâpa*  overwhelmed  by  *vâyo-dhâtu*  caused  by  *citta*  of  will  to  go  =  spreading throughout the entire body of all the *rûpa*-*dhamma*s should be realized via the eye of wisdom. 
1. Natural power-dominated *vâyo*-*dhâtu*, i.e., the natural power-dominated  

*mahâbhûta dhâtu* causing the body behavior at will in going should be  

contemplated to visualize by eye of wisdom. 

4. Visualization by eye of wisdom of *rûpa dhammas*, being carried forward – spread throughout the entire body – of *rûpa*-*kalâpa*s and *rûpa dhamma*s dominated by 

`      `natural power of *citta*-produced *vâyo*-*dhâtu*, should be made. 

Stated  in a different way –  

1. Meditate on the mind to go by eye of wisdom. 
1. Concentrate, by eye of wisdom, all the citta-produced *kâya*-*viññatti navaka kalâpa*, *kâya-viññatti-lahuta-dvidvâdasaka kalâpa* spread throughout the entire body and the way they spread.  These are the *rûpa*s that can spread, the *padhâna* = the concentrated *rûpa*s. 
1. Contemplate, to realize by eye of wisdom, the *catusamuţţânika rûpa-kâya dhamma*s located in the six *dvâra*s and 42 *kuţţâsa*.  They are *appadhâna* = *rûpa*s  

`      `(non-concentrated *rûpa*s). 

**THE CITTA TO MOVE** 

The *manodvâra*-*vijjana*, *kâmâvacara kusala*-*jh a* and *askulasala jhâna* are the citta for *puthujana* and *sekkha* *puggala* to move.  The noble *sekkha* individuals must eradicate all the kilesâ from which he has been relieved of. Such *citta*s are just  

the *manodvârika jhâna vîthi citta*, which causes arising of *iriyapaţţha viññatta rûpa*. 

It is the nature of citta that it never arises without accompaniment of *cetasika*.  It  always arises in association with relevant *cetasika*. 

*Yassa viññânam pâkaţam hoti, so “na kevalam viññânemeva uppajjati*, *tena saddhim tadevarammanam phussamâto phassopi uppajjati*, *anubhavamânâ vedanâpi*, 

*sañjânanamâna saññâpi*, *cetayamânâ cetanâpi uppajjatî”ti phassa-pañcamakeyeva  pariggannhâti* (*Ma*.- *Ţha.*- 1: 280 – 281). 

In concord with explanations of the above *Aţţhakathâ*, *citta*-*viññâna* does not arise just by itself alone.  It being so, *nâma dhamma* groups, led by *phassapañcamaka dhamma* which appear together within *citta*-*viññâna* and a *cittakhaņa*, must be cultured and analyzed by *ñâņa*.  These *nâma* groups also arise along the usual natural thought processes, called the *citta*-*niyâma* (the way the mind works). Therefore,  

they are series of *manodvârika*-*javana*-*citta* processes exerted by mind to go. 

The above-mentioned *padhâna rûpa dhamma*s and the *appadhâna rûpa* *dhamma*s are the ***rûpa***. 

\2. *Citta*-*cetasika* willing to move are the ***nâma*.** 

These *rûpa* and *nâma* are to be contemplated. 

Among these again the following are the five-fold *khandhâ*s: 

1) *Rûpa dhamma* is the *rûpa*-*kkhandhâ*.  
1) *Vedanâ* is the *vedanâ*-*kkhandhâ*. 
1) *Saññâ* is the *saññâ- kkhandhâ*. 
1) Except *vedanâ* and *saññâ*, others are *sañkhâra-kkhandhâ*. 
1) Consciousness is the *viññâna*-*kkhandhâ*. 

Make effort to concentrate analytically to realize by eye of wisdom that there are five- fold *khandhâ*s each in the *manodvâra*-*vhâna* and *jhâna*.  [With the exception of  *vedanâ* and *saññâ*,  all  the  *cetasika*s  are  the  *sañkhâra*-*kkhandhâ*,  so  that  number  in  the  *cetasika*  of *sañkhâra*-*kkhandhâ* fluctuates corresponding to that of cetasika that arises in with every *citta*- *khaņa*.  *Manodvâra*-*jhâna* is made of *citta* + *cetasika* (mind + mental concomitants) = 12 modes  of  *nâma  dhamma*s,  for  which  the  remaining  nine  *cetasika*s  are  the  *sañkhâra*- *kkhandhâ*.  If the *javana* is the *kusala*-*javana*, then – and there are 34 modes of *nâma* – then 31 *cetasika*s, exclusive of *vedanâ*, s*aññâ* and *viññâņa*, are the *sañkhara*-*kkhandhâ*s.  This should clearly be understood.] 

**METHOD OF MEDITATION IN BRIEF** 

1. Stand still at a certain place cultivate *samâdhi* (concentration) step by step. 
1. Culture all the massive *rûpa dhamma*s, of the six *dvâra*s the 42 *kuţţhâsa*, by analytically breaking them down by your *ñâņa* to the attainment realization of their *paramatta* by eye of wisdom. Then 
1. Maintain by cultivation clear mind and body.  
1. Make effort ot visualize the mind to move by making an attempt at it.  concentrate to realize the *cetasika* associated with this mind.  Concentrate to the stage of realization by eye of wisdom following the *mano-dvârika-jhâna-vîthi*. 
1. Concentrate primarily on spreading throughout the entire body of *Rûpa dhamma*s,* called  *kâya-viññatti-navaka-kalâpa*  and  *kâyaviññatti-lahuta-dvidvâsaka  kalâpa*.  (Make attempt to move gradually). 
1. Contemplate to visualize, by eye of wisdom, on the arising, here and then there, of *catusamuţţhânika  rûpa-kâya*  =  changeing  of  *rûpa  dhamma*s  one  new  place  after another because of the power of *vâyo dhamma* making up these *rûpa kalâpa*. (These are phenomena of *appadhâdna rûpa*s being carried away from one place to another.) 

When one can concentrate and analyze by *ñâña* contemplate as follows. 

1. *Padhâna  rûpa*  =  concentrated *rûpa*,  and *appadhâna*  =  non-concentrated *rûpa*   in combination and concentrate as __*Rûpa dhamma*, *R*__*ûpa dhamma*. 
1. *Citta*  and *cetasika* combined as one, and concentrated as *N**âma dhamma, Nâma dhamma***. 

N.B.  When walking up and down concentrating on *rûpa*-*nâma*, go slowly.  If it is your first time, walk on the walk-way you are used to it.  In culturing *samâdhi*, at the start of the walk-way  in  standing  position,  concentrate  on  *samuţţhânika*-*rûpa  dhamma*s,  closed  your eyes.   This  as  well  as  applies  while  walking  and  standing.   When  your  have  gradually succeeded in this exercise, you can open your eyes slightly while meditating.  Your mind set on going, the  *manodvârika jhâna* may be *kusala* or *akusala jhâna*s for you.  But at the moment of your concentration on the *rûpa*-*nâma*, they could only be  *kusala jhâna vîthi* because of *rûpa-nâma pariccheda* *ñâña* (analytical knowledge of *rûpa* and *nâma*).   

Mediation can also be made by way of fivepfold *khanddhâ*, of 12 modes of *âyatana* and of 18 *dhâtu*s. 

Among these *manodvârika javana vîthi, javana* (object of concentration) may, or may not, be the *tadârammana*.  But note that *viññatta*-*rûpa* cannot arise in the *tadârammana*.  Only when *karma rûpa*-*nâma* is taken as the object and only when *ârammana* is *vibhûtâ*- *rammana*, can *viññatta*-*rûpa* arise in the *tadârammana*.   

In so doing too, the following four should be performed time and again. 

1. Concentrate on the *rûpa* and *rûpa* only (*rûpa*-*pariggaha*). 
1. Concentrate on *nâma* and *nâma* only (*nâma-pariggaha*). 
1. Concentrate on *rûpa*-*nâma* (*rûpa-nâma-pariggaha*). 
1. Analyzing *rûpa* and *nâma* (*rûpa-nâma-vavutthâna*). 

***Yathâ yathâ vâ panassa kayo paņihito hoti, kathâ kathâ nam pajânâti*** 

This instruction from the Buddha has been explained in two different ways.  In the first method the *citta-rûpa kalâpa*s, in which is included *iriyapaţha viññatta*, concentrated as state of going – standing – sitting – lying down of the four bodily parts = 

the *cittaja-rûpa dhamma*s, kept as primary, are to be concentrated as *appadhâna*. 

In  the  second  method  it  is  instructed  that  of  the  *catusamuţţhânika  rûpa-kâya dhamma*s, which are *appadhâna*, are cultured as *padhâna*, then *cittaja-rûpa-kâya*, which are included in the *iriyapaţha viññatta-rûpa*s*  = all *rûpa dhamma*s are taken as  

*appadhâna*.  (This has been explained in section on *Rûpa Kammaţţhâna*). 

With reference to this instruction a mediator should contemplate on an *rûpa*-*nâma*  only in such a way that each bodily parts merged together.  See the following. 

1. *Cittaja*-*rûpa*, comprised of *iriyapaţha viññatta*, are kept as the padhâna, and the *catusamuţţhânika rûpa-kâya* = all the *rûpa dhamma*s, as the *appadhâna*. 
2. All the *samuţţhânika rûpa-kâya dhamma*s, existing a phenomena being carried away, are again taken as *padhâna* (exerted), and taking *cittaja*-*rûpa*s, made up of *iriyapaţha viññatta*, as *apdhâna*, and are concentrated in this way.  
2. Afterwards, continue meditating on *manodvârika javana vîthi citta*-*cetasika nâma dhamma*s, which are exerted by the mind, and that for going, standing, sitting and lying down. 
2. Then cultivate on *rûpa*-*nâma* as a follow-up. 
2. Concentrate on *rûpa*-*nâma* analytically. 

These are *cittaja-rûpa*s made of *iriyapaţha viññatta rûpa*s, existing as phenomena  of being carried away. 

It is important that concentration on the solid masses of *rûpa*  are broken down by *ñâņa* to paramatta pieces (which only be realized by the *ñâņa*).  It must be noted that only when the *ghana* (solid mass) of *rûpa* and *nâma* have been broken down can *anatta*  

(non-self) be visualized by eye of wisdom.

*Kathitâ* (*Ma.*- *Ţha.*-1: 273). 

1) The state of going is clearly realized (practice to realize). 
1) The state of standing is clearly realized (practice to realize). 
1) The state of sitting is clearly realized (practice to realize). 
1) The state of lying down is clearly realized (practice to realize). 

In the four situations of contemplation in the first section of the *iriyâpatha*, *addhâna- iriyâpatha =*  long-life bodily parts have been referred to in the Buddha’s  

expatiation. 

The  Lord  has  instructed  that  the  exercise  on   going  forward,  backward,  looking straight ahead or looking sideways, flexing or relaxing is to be made by virtue of *sampa- jañña ñâņa*.  In this case, the Lord has referred to mediocre-life bodily parts. 

Again, the *sampajañña ñâņa* has been indicated in the states of *gate* (going), *thite*  (standing),  *nisanne*  (sitting),  *sutte*  (asleep),  *jâgarite*  (waking).   In  these  five situations, the Buddha has referred to the small *iriyâpatha*s such as *khuddaka* (little one) and *cuņņika* (smallest one) of the surrounding = employs a knowledge  

that realizes the various directions of the surrounding (*Ma.-* *Ţha.-* 1:273)

*ABHIKKANTE - PAŢIKKANTE* GOING FORWARD – GOING BACKWARD 

Going forward is *abhikkante* and backward *paţikkante* forward*.* 

*Tadubhayampi catûsu iriyâpathesu labbhati* (*Abhi*.- *Ţha.-* 2: 331 – 332; M. *Ţha.-* 1:258). 

The  four  situations  of  *iriyâpatha*  can  also  be  acquired  in  both  going  forward  or backward. 

1. In the state of going, a person is directing his body forward (= all the *rûpa dhamma*s) are  said  to  be  going  forward,  and  one  whose  body  is  directed  backward  going backward. 
1. In the state of going too, a person who is leaning his body (= all the *rûpa dham-ma*s) forward while standing, without any steps made yet, is said to to be going forward; when his body is leaning backward, he is going backward.
1. In sitting (no standing nor going forward) also, a person is said to going forward (*abhikkamati*)  while sitting (facing towards the front parts of the body), as he is loking straight ahead.  The state of going toward the hinder parts of the body is sadi to be going backward.  It is the same in lying down, i.e. going forward or backward while lying down ((*Abhi*.- *Ţha.-* 2: 331 – 332; M. *Ţha.-* 1:258).

***SAMPAJÂNAKÂRI HOTI*** 

By virtue of knowledge that understands the the surrounding, one makes movements forward and backward.  in other words, a person used to employ a knowledge that realizes different directions of surroundings = employs a knowledge that could 

understand the various directions of the surrounding.

Indeed, a meditating ascetic makes going forward or backward by virtue of *sampajañña* *ñâņa*.  There is nothing that not associated with the *sampajañña* *ñâņa*. The *sampajañña* *ñâņa* is always associated with *sati* (consciusness).  The broad  explanation of *sampajañña* *ñâņa*, therefore, by *niddesa* Pâli is 

*Sato* *sampajañno abhikkamati, sato sampajañno paţikkamati*

Being mindful and endowed with *sampajañña ñâņa*, he proceeds forward, and  backward in a similar way. 

In this way, the Lord has included mindfulness too in His instruction.  An ascetic going foward or backward makes it done with consciousness (mindfulness) = never with a wavering mind nor without the all-understanding *sampajañña ñâņa*. In fact, being mindful and endowed with the *sampajañña ñâņa* which realizes various situations, movement forward or backward is made correspondingly  

(*Abhi.- Ţha.*-2: 332; *Ma.*- *Ţha.*-1: 258). 

*Sabbesu abhikkamadîsu catubbiham sampajaññam otâreti* (*Abhi.- Ţha.*-2: 332). 

In the performaces such as going forward etc., the four situations of *sampajañña* are effected (*Abhi.- Ţha.*-2: 332). 

The question here is “What is that kind of knowledge that understands, and understands clearly, by *sampajaña-kârî*, various situation in the surrounding*”*? The answer is as given below. 

THE FOUR-FOLD *SAMPAJAÑÑA*S 

1. *Satthaka sampajañña* 
1. *Sappâya sampajañña* 
1. *Gocara sampajañña* 
1. *Asammoha sampajañña* 

\1.  *Satthaka sampajañña* 

Among these four, a consciousness arises to go forward, but you would not go  

along with it.  You ask your-self if there could be or could not be of any advantage going there.  Concentration, by analysis through *ñâņa*, on the advantage or disadvantage of going is called ***Satthaka sampajañña*** (*Abhi.- Ţha.*-1: 285). 

**WHAT BENEFICIAL *DHAMMA* IS** 

*Tattha ca atthoti cetiyadassana-bodhidassana-samghassadassana-asubhadassanâ- divasena dhammato vuţţi* (*Abhi.- Ţha.*-2: 332; *Ma.- Ţha.*- 1: 258). 

In the above statement, the advantage refers to paying homage to a *cetiya*, to bo tree, to a *sanghâ*, to a *sanghâthera*, to the great teachers, and seeing an *asubha* etc.  By the power of these, development of *dhamma* is attained = development of *kusala* *dhamma*.  (If going forward or backward results in development of *kusala dhamma*, then  

it is an advantage from point of view of *satthaka*-*sampajañña*.). 

HOW THE BENEFIT CAN BE ACQUIRED 

If one could pay homage to a cetiya, or a bo tree, there arises *Buddhârammana*-*pîti* (mental feeling of loy with the Buddha as object of meditation) together with *mahâ*-*kusala mandodvârika vîthi* mental processes.  If the characters of these are taken on the nature of 

*khaya-vaya* (depletion-destruction) are taken as object of concentration on their three general characters, one can attain *Arahatta-phala*.  If the homage is paid to *sanghâthera*s (= great teachers), and *vipassanâ* exercise made following their teaching, one can acquire  *Arahatta- phala*.    Concentrating on the *asubha* (the dead body = loathsomeness), and attaining the first *jhâna* on this dead body, then the *khaya-vaya* nature of that *jhâna* are contemplated on the the three general characters, one can also attain the *Arahatta-phala*.   Therefore, paying homage to *cetiya*, to the bo tree, to *sanghâ*, to *sanghâ thera*, seeing the dead body etc., should be taken to have the benefit.  (This benefit can be enjoyed by those who have acquired *nâma- rûpa-pariccheda-ñâņa* the  successful concentration on ultimate reality of the *rûpa-nâma*, the *paccaya-pariggaha-ñâņa* the successful contemplation on the nature of the *paţiccasamuppâda* = causal relationship at past, future and present periods, and have acquired *viapssanâ*-*ñâņa* to the attainment of *bhañga*- *ñâņa*, the ability to concentrate on the causal relation- 

ship of the *rûpa-nâma* = the *sañkâra dhamma*s, to their three genral characters).  

To those who believe in *keci*, the material wealth *âmisa* also is a benefit, *sîla, samâdhi, paññâ*, the three-fold noble moralities dependent upon the four kinds of materials, the *ariaya magga*, one has the chance to practice insupport of the *sâsanâ* called *magga- brahmacariya* which are *sâsana brahmâ*-*cariya* (*Abhi*- *Ţha*.-2: 332;Ma.- *Ţha*.-1:258). 

*SAPPÂSAMPAZAÑÑA* 

In going along with the intention of paying homage to the *cetiya* etc., discrimation of whether it is suitable or not is made by *ñâņa*, and only that which is suitable is  

followed.  This is the ***sappâya-sampajañña***. 

It is indeed beneficial to pay homage to the *cetiaya*.  If, however, celebration of a festival on a large scale for the purpose has been made, then people from far and near would have gathered there.  People, men and wemen  would be clad in the best clothes they could afford  and  be  going  round  and  round.   If  a  meditator  encounters  *iţţhârammana*  then  an attachment and *lobha* to it could have arisen in him.  If  an *aniţţhârammana* is encountered, then *pagţigha phenomenon of* gross mind would arise in him.  Moha phenomena would arise depending on these *kâmaguņa*s, because of unwise attention (men handsome or not, wemen beautiful or ugly etc.) due to lack of penetrative attention 

of the right object of concentration.  Pushing through the crowd contact with wemen would result  in  commiting  *kâyasamgassa*  (violation  through  body  contact).   Accidents  with elephants or a vehicle could have resulted in life-threatening injuries.  Encounter with various *visabhâga-ârammana*s (objects of extraordinary nature) has cause unhappiness in the *sâsanâ*, will  to  leave  a  monk’s  life  to become  a  layman,  which  are  not  condusive  to  success  in cultivating *sîla, samâdhi* and *paññâ*, which are the practice of *brahmacariya*.  If such these are the results, then the place of *cetiya*, where festivals are being held, is an *asappaya* (place not suitable as yet to go).  The above mentioned dangers do not occurred, then it is *sappâya* (a place suitable to go).  The same principles  

apply to the case of paying homage to the bo tree (*Abhi*- *Ţha*.-2: 332-333). 

Paying homage to the *sanghâ* also is beneficial.  But a big crowd listening to the sermon, given by the *sanghâ*s, throughout the whole night is an *asappâya*, as in the above case.   If  such  a  place  is  not  a  danger  to  the  well  being  of  man  and  to  noble  practice *brahmacariya*, then the it is a suitable place to go.  This is also true of paying homage to  *mathera*s surrounded by crowd of believers (*Abhi*- *Ţha*.-2: 332-333; *Ma*.- *Ţha*.-1:258-9). 

Concentrating on the *asubha* also of benefit.  To make it explicit, a story runs like this.  A young Arahant, accompanied by a novice, went around to find a material to make a toothbrush.  As they went along, the young novice continued the expedition from the roadside and came across an *asubha* (dead human body).  Taking it as an object, the novice attempted to attain the first *asubha jhâna* then and there.  After acquiring it, he exercise *vipassanâ* on the  three  genral  characters  of  the  *sañkhâra  dhamma*s.   Then  he  succeeded  in  attaining *anâgâmi-magga-phala* by series of *magga* and *phala*.  But he did not stopthere, but continued exercising on the causal relationhip of *rûpa*-*nâma*, the object of meditation for *vipassanâ*- *ñâņa*, to attain the higher *magga-ñâņa* referred to as the  

*arahatta-magga*. 

When the *arahant* has lost sight of the novice he called out as “*sâmaņe*, *sâmaņe*.” [From the day of his entering a novice’s life reciting the words of the arahants has become the first words ever produced.  Not following the aranhant’s words has becomem his second language.  The novice always speaks the first words, but never the second.  Therefore, this is a *sâmaņe* (the novice) who never speaks two different languages (*Ma*.- 

*Ţî*.- 1: 335).]*  

Then the pondered.  “Since the day of becoming a novice, I have never ever spoken two different languages with the arahants.  I would acquire the noble dhammas the higher *maggañâņa* and *phala*-*ñâņa*.  After having such a thought, the novice answered the arahant’s call, “yes sir, what is it?”  “Come along” was the arahant’s single call.  The *sâmaņe* came along and said “Sir, go along this way first, then at the place  

where I have been standing and look and see towards the east.”  

The young *arahant* duely acted as the *sâmaņe* has indicated, and succeeded in  attaining *anâgâmi-magga- ñâņa* and *phala*-*ñâņa*.   

In this way, the dead body has appeared for the benefit of two individual worldlings.  Benefit it may provide, the female dead body would be an *asappaya* for a male meditator and the male dead body for a female meditator.  The male dead body is *sappâya* for a male and meditator, and the feamale dead body for a female meditator.   

This  could  lead  one  to  the  attainment  of  *asubha-jhâna*.   The  ability  to   discrimate,  by analytical *ñâņa*, as to whether a factor is *sappâya* or *asappâya* and  only the one that is *sappâya* is referred to as ***sappâya-sampajañña***  (*Abhi*- *Ţha*.-2: 332-333; *Ma*.- *Ţha*.-1:258-9). 

[In *samatha* having a male *asubha* as the object of concentration for a male meditator is *sabhâga* (of usual nature). So is it for female.  In *samatha* effort is made of intensive concentration commonly on  the dead body to attain *jhâna*. The contemplation is made until *jhâna*  attained.    If  *visabhâga*  (unusal)  object  has  been  concentrated  upon  intensively, *paţibhânimitta* will be acquired, which in turn form an object for arising of *pîti* and *sukha* associated with *samâdhi*.  Then the already-attained *samâdhi* will  deteriorate, and would be unable to progressed towards higher *jhâna-samâdhi*.  That is why it usual to concentrate on common dead body in *samatha*.  In *vipassanâ* exercise, however, concentration upon the dead body of *Sîrimâ* by *arahant*s of both sexes, male and female laities has been mentioned in  old  scriptures,  Vijaya-Suttana  etc..   the  concentration  can  be  made  on  both  *sabhâga- visabhâga* factors.  It will be clearly  

describedin section on Vipassanâ). 

***GOCARA-SAMPAJAÑÑA*** 

The meditating *arahant*, who has succeeded in culturing *sâtthaka-sampajaññâ* and *sappâya-sampajañña*, by analytical cultured via analytical knowledge, has learned *gocara* (= *kammaţţhâna ârammana*), one which he likes most from among the 38 modes of *samatha* *kammaţţhâna*.  He exercise on it to the attainment of *uggaha nimitta* (an image recognized by mind), and concentrating on it during alms-colleting round (= going around alms-collection with that *kammaţţhâna* taken to heart.  This concentration is  

called ***gocarasampajañña*** (Abhi.- *Ţha*.-2: 333; *Ma*.- *Ţha*.-1: 259). 

[N.B.  With reference to these explanations, it must be noted that the  *gocara-sampajañña* is concerned with *samatha* exercise only.  The *samatha* *kammaţţhâna* is of (38) kinds, where *âkâsa-kasiņa*  is  explained  in  *âkâsânañcâyatana  jhâna*,  *âloka-kasiņa*  in  *odâta-kasiņa*  and included  in  it.    Although  *gocara-sampajañña*  is  orientated  towards  the  *samatha* *kammaţţhâna*, if the meditator himself has succeeded in *vipassanâ* exercise  surpassing the *samatha*, then he can meditate by both ways.  This is explained so because it will be seen that *gocara-sampajañña* is associated with the *samatha*, whereas *asammoha-sampajañña* with the *vipassanâ*.  One should have wrong belief that *vipassanâ* exercise should not be made while going alms-collection round and it way back.] 

**THE FOUR KINDS OF *VUTTA*** 

THE FOUR KINDS OF CONDUCT 

In this *sâsanâ*,  the following *catukka* (a set of four) should be understood for the  clarity of *gocara-sampajañña*. 

1) Some  *bhikkhû*s  go  along  with  *kammaţţhâna*,  exerting  effort  to  exercise  on  it during alms-collection rounds, but not on the way back. 
1) Some *bhikkhû*s go along with *kammaţţhâna*, exerting effort to exercise on it   on the way back, but not during alms-collection rounds. 
1) Some do not either way. 
1) Some *bhikkhû*s go along with *kammaţţhâna*, exerting effort to exercise on it          both during alms-collection rounds, and on the way back. 
1) **One who goes along with *kammaţţhâna*, exerting effort to exercise**  **on it** **during alms-collection rounds, but not on the way back.**

Among the four kinds of *bhikkhû*s, one practices the whole day while walking and  sitting  so  as  to  be  relieved  of  *nîvarana  dhamma*s  (hinderances)  to  *kusala  dhamma*s  (= distancing himself from the *nîvarana dhamma*s by acquiring one of *samâdhi*s, referred to as *upâcâra-samâdhi* and *appanâ-samâdhi*).  The practice was made during the fisrt part of the night to get the mind cleansed of *nîvaraņa* factors.  At midnight he went to sleep, and at dawn the arahant whiled away the time *samattha* is taken the to the heart by walking and sitting exercises.  In the early morning he carried out the duty of *cetiyasañ*-*gaņa vutta* at the *cetiya*, *bodiyañgaņa vutta* at the bo tree and water to it, filled water in pots the water for  drinking, then practiced *âcariya-vutta* due to the teachers and*  

` `*uppajjhâra-vutta*  due  to  the  *uppajjhâra*  teachers.   All  of  these  duties  are  referred  to  as *khandhaka-vutta.*   

The *bhikkhû* then washed his face, paid short and long visits, cleaned himself and entered the the monastry and made mental culture cross-legged two or three times, by which he warmed himself up.  After the  mental exercise and when time is up to  go for alms- collection rounds, he got up still exercising the *kammaţţhâna* (= taking *kammaţţhâna* to heart) picked up alms-bowl and the robe and left the monastry.  Still taking *kammaţţhâna* to heart (not forgetting his usual *parihâriya kammaţţhâna*), the *bhikkhû* went to the *cetiya*. If his *parihâriya kammaţţhâna* happened to be *buddhâ-nussati kammaţţhâna*, he would enter the compound  of  the  *cetiya*  still  concentrating  on  the  *buddhâ-nussati  kammaţţhâna*.   If  his 

exercise  happened  to  one  other  than  *buddhâ-nussati  kammaţţhâna*,  such  as  *ânâpâna* (mindfulness of in- and out-breath), then he should leave it at the start of the passage way to the *cetiya* compound, make effort to acaquire *Buddhârammana*-*pîti* having the *Buddha-guņa*  as the object of concentration.  After attaining this state, turn three round on your right around the *cetiya* and pay homage to it at four corners, if the *cetiya* is a large one.  If the *cetiya* is a small one, turn three rounds and pay homage to it at eight corners.  After completing paying homage to the *cetiya*, the *bhikkhû* came to the ground around the bo tree and pay homage to it respectfully, as if he were right infront of the Buddha. 

[N.B.  The *cetiya* and the bo tree were those located on the way of alms-collection 

round, not the ones at the monastic dwelling.] 

The *bhikkhû* then came out of the monastry back and at the entrance he picked the his usual practice of *pârihâriya* *kammaţţhâna*, took to the heart, wrapped around his robe and entered the village for the purpose of alms collection.  When the *dâyaka*s and *dâyika*s saw the arahant coming, they welcome him saying “our *bhikkhû* has come” and took the alms-bowl from him.  They would made him rest in the village house or at home and offered porridge.  The *dâyaka*s and *dâyika*s washed his legs, massaged and apply  

massaging  oil.   Sitting  at  a  proper  place   infront  of  the  rahant,  they  would  respectfully discussed various problems of their daily life, while waiting the food to get cooked.  They would listen to his preaching.  If the *dâyaka*s and *dâyika*s did not request for preaching,  *aţţhakathâ* teachers has indicated that the sermon should be in their honor. 

[*Janasañgahatta*  –  The   *aţţhakathâ*  teachers  have  stated  that  the  laiies  should  be honored with *dhamma-nuggaha* with “If I do not offer them a preaching, who will? ” in  mind (*Ma*.- *Ţî.-* 1:356).] 

*Dhammakathâ hi kammaţţhâna-vinimuttâ nâma natthi* (*Abhi*. -*Ţha*.- 2:334; Ma.- *Ţha.* - 1: 260). 

*Dhammakathâ*  –  Talks  on  (the  Buddha’s)  doctrine  are  always  associated  with *kammaţţhâna*.  So, while having alms-food concentrate on your usual *kammaţţhâna* (= taking to heart the *pârihâriya* *kammaţţhâna* you are used to practicing on).  Preach *anumodanâ dhamma* (expression of appreciation) while having the usual *kammaţţhâna* at heart.  The *bhikkhû*, with the *dâyaka*s and *dâyika*s who followed him to see him off, came out of the village, and the followers were asked to leave him at the village exist.  He  

continued his journey along the way back to the monastry. 

When the young *bhikkhû*s and novices, who left the monastry earlier than the *bhikkhû* for alms-collection, on the way back to the monastry, were having their meal  

outside the village.  When they saw him coming, they welcome him. Help carry the alms- bowl and the robe. 

The *bhikkhû*s of early times took care of their teachers, an act which has its roots in days of *buddha*s, referred to as the *poraņaka bhikkhû*s, not for special favour.  This action was taken irrespective whether or not familiar, but whoever it is they would take good care of him.  The  young *bhikkhû*s then asked the bhikkhû, who has just returned from the alsm collection rounds in the village, if those who were taking good care of him were his relatives.  Then the *bhikkhû* countered as to why they asked such a question.  The young *bhikkhû*s replied “because we noted that they paid respect and took good care  

of you.” 

“My *bhikkû*s, it is hard to carry out such duties even to their mothers and fathers.  They, however, perform these duties for us.  Our alms-bowls and robes are theirs, because of their assistance we do not have to face danger nor starvation in time of famine.  We owed them a gratitude  and there are none comparable to them.”   In this way, the *bhikkhû*s have replied in praise of the *dâyaka*s and *dâyika*s, and entered the monastry without exercising while chatting among themselves.  This kind of *bhikkhû* shouldbe  referred to as “ **practicing *kammaţţhâna* on the trip to alms-collection round, but not on the return trip from the village to the monastry**.  (*Abhi*.- *Ţha*. 2: 

333 – 335; *Ma.- Ţha*.-1: 259 – 261). 

2) **One who does not practice** ***kammaţţhâna* on the trip for alms-collection  but does on the return trip** 

A certain *bhikkhû* got up early in the morning and carried out duties due to him as mentioned above.    While doing so, he felt so hungry that he started sweating heavily.  The empty stomach was so troublesome that he had to forfeit *kammaţţhâna*.  The bhikkhû  

then picked up his alms-bowl and robe quickly, came out of the monastic dwelling and pay homage to the *cetiya*.  He procceded to the village early, got a bowl of yâgu (gruel) and drank it at the public rest place.  A two- or three-mouthful of gruel helped hin get relief from hunger, and felt the whole body cooled down.  Then with his mind set on the *kammaţţhâna*  = *kammaţţhâna* taking to the heart, continued having gruel.  Later, he washed his bowl, mouth and face, exercise on *kammaţţhâna* before alms-collection round and eating time.  At the time of having the morning meal the *kammaţţhâna* is taken to the heart.  From the time of alms- collection and of alms-food the *kammaţţhâna* has been exercised repetitively, continuing it to his way back.  Such a monk is referred to as “one who does not exercise *kammaţţhâna* on alsm-collection round, but does so on his way 

back fro the village to the monastic dwelling.” (*Abhi*-*Ţha.-* 2: 333; *Ma*.- *Ţha.-* 1: 261).** 

***GAŅANAPATHAM VÎTI VATTA***     

*Edisâ ca bhikkhû yâgum pivitvâ vipassanam ârabhitvâ Buddha-sâsane ahârattam pattâ nâma gaņanapattam vîtivatta*.  _Sîhaļadipeyyeva tesu tesu gâmesu **âsanasâlâya**_** _na tam_ _âsanam atthi, yattha yâgum vivitvâ arahattam pattâ bhikkhû natthîti_ (_Abhi_.- _Ţha_. 2: 335; _Ma.- Ţha_.-1: 259 – 261). 

After  having  the  gruel,  the  *bhikkhû*s  continued  mental  exercising  and  attained *arahatta-phala*.  Such successful individuals are innumerable in the Buddha *sâsanâ*.  In Sri Lanka, for example, there is no place without the *bhikkhû*s who had acquired *arahatta-phala* after continued meditation of *kammaţţhâna* right after *yâgu* meal  in the*  

morning (*Abhi*.- *Ţha*. 2: 335; *Ma.- Ţha*.-1: 259 – 261). 

3) **One who does not practice *kammaţţhâna* on the way   to and back from the alms-collection rounds** 

A certain *bhikkhû* leads a life in the Buddha *sâsanâ* without *kammaţţhâna* practice but not  taking  it  seriously.   A  *bhikkhû*  is  bound  by  two  compulsory  duities:  *gantha  dûra*  – teaching and learning the Buddha’s doctrine, and *vipassanâ dûra* –  to exercise *vipassanâ* meditation.  The *bhikkhû* neglected these two duties, nor did he fulfill that *vatta* a  

*bhikkhû* is bound to perform. 

1. Craving for the living and non-living meaterials = still lingered on to *raga*. 
1. Attachment to his own material body = still lingered on to *râga*. 
1. *Bahidda* = still lingered on to external material factors. 
1. Try to enjoy comfort in dosing, sleeping on the back and sides after having a full meal. 
1. Practice *sâsanahma-cariya* with an intenstion of attaining of celestial realm of no  

`      `particular plane. 

These are the five modes of obstacle to the *citta* (mind).  

With his mind wrapped in these obstacles, the *bhikkhû* remained in the *sâsanâ*.  He entered  the  village,  having  no  perception  in  mind  that  “There  is  such  a  thing  as *kammaţţhâna*,”  for  alms-  collection.   In  the  village  he  would  mingle  with  villagers,  an unbecoming *bhikkhû*’s life, chatting while going along with the villagers.  Then he would come to a public rest place and had his meal without *kammaţţhâna* exercise, and with nothing in mind the bhikkhû left the village.  Such a bhikkhû should be designated as  

“one who does not carry with hin the *kammaţţhâna* when going around for alms-collection nor on his return to the monastic premises (*Abhi*.- *Ţha*. 2: 335; *Ma.- Ţha*.-1: 259 – 261). 

4) **One who meditate both to and from the village for alms-collection** 

**round (*Gatapaccâ-gatikavatta*)** 

A  certain  *bhikkhû*  “cultivates  *kammaţţhâna*  on  the  way  to  the  village  for  alms- collection rounds, and on the way back from the village to the monastic dwelling.”  Now,  recognize such a *bhikkhû* as ***gatapaccâ-gatikavatta*.**    

A man enters the *sâsanâ* realm as a *bhikkhû* with the intention of attaining *magga*, *phala* and *nibbâna*.   Then they gather in groups of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 100 and agreed among themselves to share a monastic dwelling. 

“*Ãvuso tumhe na iņaţţhâ na bhyaţţâ*, *na* *âjîvikâpakatâ pabbajitâ*, *dukkhâ muccitukâmâ panettha pabbajitâ*.  *Tasmâ gamane uppannakilesam gamaneyyeva nigganhatha*.  *Ţhâne*,  *nisajjâya*, *sayane uppannakilesam sayaneyyeva nigganhatha*.” 

“My Lords  ---- You have entered the monkhood not because of debts you owed to others, nor have you run away from the ruler’s punishment.  You have entered the realm of *sâsanâ* not because it is difficult to make  ends meet as a laity.  In fact, it is with the intention of being delivered from the suffering of the sansâric circus that you have adopted a life in the Buddha’s Order.  Therefore, get yourself relieved of *kilesâ*  

(defilement) that would arise at the moments of walking, standing, sitting and sleeping. 

Making promises among themselves to get rid of *kilesa* whenever it arises, they  reside in the same dwelling. 

Aftr such undertaking, they went out for alms-collection.  On the way they came across large stones at every half *usabha*, one *usabha* (a measure of distance), half *gâvuta*, one *gâvuta* (a measure of distance also).  They continued their journey while concentrating on the perception of the features of the stones.  (That is to say to mark a  

stone from spot of which the meditation is started on the  way to and from the village). 

If the *kilesâ* arises in a certain *bhikkhû* at a certain moment, it is got rid of then and there.  [Picking up the routine mental exercise surrounded by the five great powers of *saddâ*), *viriya*, *sati*, *samâdhi* and *paññâ* the *kilesâ* is extinguished).  If he failed in doing so, he would sopt  and  stand  still,  and  the  pne  behind  would  also  stop.   (It  is  because  one  *bhikkhû* understands the other, it would not have occurred in his mind as “What’s wrong with this one?  He stopped while he should be continuing to the destination.”  This understanding among the *bhikkhû*s is quite helpful in curbing the *kilesâ*, an act quite respectable on the part of every *bhikkhû*.  Understanding among the meditators is of great  

help in cultivating, and is a kind of *paţipatti* (conduct).  Now continue.] 

The *bhikkhû*, in whom *kilesâ* is arising, thought to himself, “Well, the one behind kows what’s happening to you.  This *vitakka* in your *santâna* is consistent with your way of life.”  In this way, the *bhikkhû* came to himself, and picked up the routine *vipassanâ*  

exercise step by step and attained *ariya* plane.   

If the *kilesâ* couldnot be curtailed by standing still, the bhikkhû would sit down, and the one behind followed suit.  Then, while sitting he would make every effort to curb 

the *kilesâ*, by taking the previous exercise to the heart.  [The understanding that if kilesâhad been arising and toturing him, he and the one behind, would be late for alms-collection, and would have to forego the meal of the day.  Such a consideration for his colleague creates a *yonisomanisikâra* (right intention).  Because of this, the *bhikkhû*  

exercised on the mental training (*Ma.- Ţî.-*1: 356).  Though *ariya* plane could not be attained, the *kilesâ* could be eliminated for a considerable time by power of *jhâna*-*samâdhi* in the form of *vikkhambhana-pahâna*, and the *bhikkhû* started moving for the purpose of alms collecting with his own *kammaţţhâna* taken to the heart.  He would not shake his legs without mind associated with *kammaţţhâna* (= never losing the object of the exercise). If he did, however, he would return to previous place with the mind not associated with *kammaţţhâna*.  Then he started  again  with  the  mind  associated  with  *kammaţţhâna*.   Remember  the  great Mahâphussadeva Mathera (*Abhi.- Ţha.*-2: 335 – 336; *Ma*.- *Ţha.*-1: 262). 

**The Noble Mahâphussadeva Mathera** 

The Noble Mahâphussadeva Mathera has been fulfilling the *gata-paccâgatavatta* (= *gatapaccâ-gatikavatta*) for the whole of the 19 years.  The people, those ploughing their fields, those transplanting the rice plants, and those who are thrashing the paddy along the way to alms-collection rounds, noted the Mathera going to and fro.  The remark among themselves was that “Has the Mathera lost his way, or has he forgotten something at his dwelling.”   The Mathera, however, condoned their remarks, and practice hardly on the mind associated with *kammaţţhâna*.  In this way in twenty years’ time, he attained the  Arahatta-Phala. 

On the day of the attainment of Arahatta-Phala, a *yukkha-devatâ* (tree spirit) appeared standing at the start of the walk-way and offering light by burning his finger tips.  To pay homage to the Mathera, approached the four kings celestial beings of  

*Catumahârâja*, Sovereigh of heaven, and the King Sahampati-Brahmâ. 

After seeing the light from burning fingers and from the devâs, the Vanavâsî  Mahâtissa Mathera asked the Noble Mahâphussadeva Mathera as follows. 

Last night I saw light around you.  Where are they from?  “Well, light can come from an oil lamp or from a ruby,” was the answer to avoid from telling him was really  

has happened that night. 

Then Vanavâsî Mahâtissa Mathera said, “You are secretive, aren’t you?”  “Yes”  was the answer to it (*Abhi.- Ţha.*-2: 336; *Ma*.- *Ţha.*-1: 262 - 263). 

**N.B.**  The Noble Mahâphussadeva Mathera would not care whatever others say about him, but concentrate on his *kammaţţhâna* uninterrupted.  This is one of the  priceless old methods that one should follow.  Ignorant sentient beings have the habit of making frivolous talks.  If attention has been given to such talks, you will be wasting your previous time, and deteriorate the practice of *kammaţţhâna*.  If you could concentrate, take your  *kammaţţhâna* on to the heart, and lead your life with citta associated with *kammaţţhâna*, you would succeed as the Noble Mahâphussadeva Mathera one day. 

**The Noble *Mahânâgama Mathera*** 

The great Mahânâga Mathera, residing at *Kâļavulli mandâna* (= black vine *mandâna*) fulfilled  the  *gatapaccagatavatta*,  first  he  decided  to  practiced  *dukkha-cariya*,  which  the Buddha  spent  6  years  =  ***Mahâpâdha***  method,  for  7  years  as  *paţi*-*patti-pûja*  (devotional attention).  During these 7 years, standing, walking up and down (= taking the *kammaţţhâna* to the heart while walking up and down and standing).  These were carried out with self- determination.  (the Mathera never changed his body to sitting or sleeping positions, except when having alms meal and when paying long and short visits.  When the seven years of resolution has completed, the Mathera again practiced in conti- 

nuation the *gatapaccagatavatta* for 16 years and acquired the Arahatta-Phala. 

The  great  Mathera  strode  for  walking  with  his  mind  associated  with  the  *kam- maţţhâna*, and lifted the legs in the same way.  If he ever did so without *kammaţţhâna*- associated mind (= moving his legs  while his mind has lost the *kammaţţhâna*), he would  turn back to where he had started, and proceeded with *kammaţţhâna*–associated mind.   (*kammaţţhâna* here means the routine one). 

In this way the Mathera continued going and arrived near a village.  There, he chose such  a place  that  no  one  could  recognize  him,  stood  still,  wrapped  around  his  robe  and washed the alms-bowl with water carried in a container in his arm.  The Mathera then had a gulp of water and kept in the mouth without swallowing.  This is done with the intention that “if people come and offer alm-food or pay homage to me, I would have blessed them with a wish – *Dîghâyukâ hotha* =  may you live long – and I would lose my  

concentration.” 

If any one asked “my Lord what is today,” or the number of *bhikkhû*s at the monastry or a certain problem is put to him, the the Mathera would swallow the water and gave the answer.  If none is encountered on the way, then he would spit out the water on his way back at the gate of the village and proceed to the monastic dwelling  (*Abhi.-*  

*Ţha.*-2: 336; *Ma*.- *Ţha.*-1: 262 - 263). 

**An Invaluable Instruction** 

Even if he blessed the laity for a longer life, the great Mahânâga Mathera would have lost his concentration.  That is the reason he had a mouthful of water, for the great Mathera could not afford his concentration dispersing from him.  One must be careful not to lose concentration, by  chatting,  if  one  intended  to  attain *nibbâna*.   Too  much  chatting  is  not associated with the noble *sikkhâ* (training) = *sîla, samâdhi, paññâ*.   In fact, chatting is one of the root causes of losing one’s concentration.  Therefore, this is an  

invaluable instruction for you intent on contemplating. 

The Fifty *Bhikkhû*s Keep Lent at a Monastry on  the Bank of *Kalamba* River 

In  the  monastry  on  the bank  of  Kalamba,  50 *bhikkhû*s  spent  four  months  of  lent having an agreement among themselves not chat with each other until the Arahatta-phala is attined.  They entered the village with mouthful of water.  If any body enquire day of the week etc., they would clear water from the mouth to answer the query. [The chatting is not entirely stopped, but answered the enquiry that should answered, unlike a dumb  

object, because the Buddha did not like the habit a dumb-like behavior.] 

The villagers, looking at the wet earth, because of removing water in the mouth, noted one or two *bhikkhû*s have returned from the village.  It also occurred in their minds what has happened  to  their  *bhikkhû*s.   If  they  do  not  talk  to  us,  would  they  do  the  same  among themselves?  If they did not chat among themselves, then there might a certain disagreement among the *bhikkhû*s.  “Come along, we would go to them and ask them to  

foreget any disagreement and to tolerate any misunderstanding.  

With a genral concensus, the villagers went up to the monastry.  When they get there, they found the all the *bhikkhû*s, except two who were together and taking bath at a place.  Then villager, with presence of mind, told the others that “My friends, this does not look like a place where the *bhikkhû*s have had disagreement among themselves.  Look, the compounds of cetiya and bo tree have been swept clean, the sweeper after use has been well placed.  The water pots have been filled and placed properly.”  Then the villagers turned back and headed toward their village.  The *bhikkhû*s spent three months of lent, attained *Arahatta-phala*, and perform  *visuddhipavâraņa*  on  the  full  moon  *mahâpavâraņa*  day.   [Ceremony  of  the 

invitation of criticism among the *kilesâ*-free *bhikkhû*s if each is seen or suspected any wrong doing is called *visuddhipavâraņa*.  

(*Abhi*.-*Ţha.*-2: 337; *Ma*.- *Ţha.*-1: 263). 

[N.B.  The villagers understand the rule of practice, and so return without making any enquiry of the *bhikkhû*s’ behavior.  Even now, the *dâyakâ*s and *dâyikâ*s should refrain from talking too long with the *bhikkhû*s who are exercising on *samatha* and  

*vipassanâ*.] 

**Rules and Regulations that Should be Followed** 

Like the Mahânâga Mathera at Kâļavunlika and the 50 *bhikkhû*s that observed three  months of spent at a  monastry  on  the bank of Kalamba River, the  bhikkhû proceeds to the village with the mind associated with *kammţţhâna* (with mind having *kammţţhâna* always taken to heart).  (It specially refers to usual *kammaţţhâna*,  

one exercise of the 40 kinds, such as *ânâpâna* in- and out-breath). 

The village in which alms-collection round, with mouthful of water, is to be made is approached, and make a prior inspection of the road leading to it.  This road should be free of drunkards, gamblers, wild elephants or horses.  If the alms-collection round is made, the *bhikkhû* should not walk briskly.  *Paņdapâtika-dhutanga* walking with a certain speed is undesirable.  When walking on an uneven road, go in such a way as if the the surface is evenly smooth.   The alms-collection is made at every house, those willing to and those unwilling to donate alms-food is noted, and waited for an appropriate duration time.  When the collection has been completed, the *kammaţţhâna* is taken to heart at a suitable place is selected in or outside the village or in the monastry where water etc., is available.  Here *paţikûla-saññâ*  repulsiveness of food is perceived.  After 

such a perception,  food should be looked upon as by virtue of the following examples. 

1. Like *Akkhabbhañjana*, the greasing the hub of a wheel, 
1. Like *Vaņâlepana*, medicine applied to a wound, 
1. Like *puttamam* person who eat his own son’s flesh to be able to overcome  obstacles (*Sam*.-1: 233). 

After such a consideration, perceived as 

1. I am having this meal not for the purpose of playing around like village boys. 
2. I am having this meal  not  for  the  purpose  of  gaining  strength  like  a  boxer  or  a wrestler. 
2. I am having this meal not for the purpose of beautifying my self to sell by body in the palace atmosphere. 
2. I am having this meal not for the purpose of making my self good looking like  professional deancers. 

As a matter of fact, the food is consumed:  

1. For the maintenance of this body made of the four elements. 
1. For the well-being and long life. 
1. For the relief of suffering due to hunger. 
1. For the attainment of the two modes of *Brahmacariya*  such as *Sâsana-Brahmacariya* 
- the three-fold *sikkhâ* of *sîla*-*samâdhi*-*paññâ*, and *Magga-Brahmacariya* referred to as the Ariya-Magga (the Noble Path). 
5. For relief of suffering of extreme hunger. 
5. For hinderance of arising of new suffering of hunger. 
5. For better feeling of the body as a whole after having food. 
5. For a peaceful existence, but not the suffering due to *citta* in searching, receving  

and consuming, after having the food. 

`     `The *ahâra* is consumed, concentrating on its 8-fold *paccavekkhaņa* features. 

After having the alms-food, and ther alms-bowl washed, a slight tiredness due fullness could arise, which could be relieved by lying donw on your left side (or whatever  

body position is preferred). 

*Kammaţţâna* exercise is taken to heart the whole morning by sitting or walking up and down as well as after lunch, before midnight and at dawn. 

Such *bhikkhû*s, who are fulfilling the function of *gattapaccâgata-vutta*, are referred to as **those who exercise *Kammaţţâna* both on the way to from the village for  alms-collection round** (*Abhi*.- *Ţţha.-*2: 337; *Ma*.- *Ţţha*.- 1: 363-364). 

One who fulfills the *paccagatavatta* by exercising *Kammaţţâna* on the way to from alms-collection round, and so complete with *upanissaya* as to attain the *Arahatta*- 

*phala*, then he can acquire the following. 

1. He could attain the *Arahatta*-*Phala* at the first part of his life, if not, 
1. At the the *macchima* (middle) part of his life, and if not, 
1. Then at *pacchima* (the last) part of his life. 

`      `If the attainment of *Arahatta*-*Phala* is still impossible at *pacchima* existence, 

4. It can be acquired at a time prior to near death moment. Supposed *Arahatta-Phala* cannot be attained at a time prior to death. 
4. It can be acquired as deity in the realm of celestial beings. Again, suppose the *Arahatta-Phala* cannot be attained in this realm, and suppose   also that one is endowed with powerful support as a cause = *upanissaya* which is powerful enough to acquire *paccakkha*-*bodhiñâņa*.
4. If one happens to acquire the life of sentient being at a time when the enlightened *Sammâsambuddhâ*s have not arisen, then one can attain *paccekabodhi-ñâņa.* 

If *paccekabodhi-ñâņa* cannot be attained, still endowed with *upanissaya-ñâņa.* 

7. Like  Rev.  Bâhiyadâruciriya  Mathera,  if  existence  of  *Khippâbhañña*  *Bhikkhû*s, possessing  special knowledge that enables one to acquireArahatta-Magga and  

`      `*Arahatta-Phala*  in  no  time  in  the  presence  of  the  enlightened  ones  *Sammâsam-*  

*buddha*s.  In addition, if he is endowed with *upanissaya*, then one can attain 

8. Status of a recluse of great knowledge, like the Rev. Sâriputtarâ Mathera, or 
8. The status of an arahant of great power, like the Rev. Moggallâna Mathera, or  
8. The status of an ascetic with the  ability of *etadañga* (pre-eminent in position) in practice of *dutañga*, like the Rev. Mahâ-Kassapa Mathera, or 
8. The status of a recluse being *etadañga* in functioning of *dibba-cakkhu-abhiññâņa* (the Heavenly eye), like the Rev. Anuruddhâ Mathera,or 
8. The status of a recluse being *etadañga* in the practice of *vinaya*, like the Rev. Upâli Mathera, or 
8. The status of a recluse being *etadañga* in performance of a Dhamma-kathika, like the Rev. Puņņa Mathera, the son of Mantâņņi the female byahmana, or
8. Can be an recluse being *etadañga* like the Rev. Revata, the youngest borther of the Rev. Sâriputtarâ, or 
8. Can  be  an  recluse  being  *etadañga*  in  the  possession  of  *bahusuta*  (having  great knowledge) like the Rev. Ãnandâ Mathera, or 
8. Can be an recluse being *etadañga* in wishing for *Sikkhâkâma* = the 3-fold noble  morality like the Rev. Râhulâ Mathera, the son of the Buddha. 

In this *catukka* (tetrad), the recluse, practicing *kammaţţâna* on the way to and from the alms collection rounds, has acquired the *gocara*-*sampajañña* has attained it peak  

in him. 

Here – ***Abhikkante paţikkante sampajânakârî hoti*** = going forward or backward is made  with  *sampajañña  ñâņa*  the  knowledge  of  comprehension.   In  the  section  on  the explanation of this Pâļi, the three mode of *sampajañña* have been given as *sâtthasampa*- *jañña*,  *sappâya*-*sampajañña*  and  *gocara-sampajañña*.   There,  however,  still  remains  the *asammoha*-*samjañña*.   Before  writing  on  it,  ***Upanissaya-Sampanna***  and  ***Diţţhe  diţţha mattam*** will be treated with reference to explanations by previous *Aţţhakathâ* (commen- tators) and Ţîkâ sayâdaws. 

***Upanissaya-Sampanna*** 

*Tahhta paccekabodhiyâ upanissaya sampadâ kappânam dve asankheyyâni sata- satasahassañca tijjam puññañâ ñâņa-sambharaņam*, *sâvaka-bodhiyam eggasâvakânam ekam asañkheyyam kappa satasahassañca, mahâsâvakânam kappa satasahassañmeva*, *itaresam atîtâsu jâtîsu vivuţţasanissayavasena nibbattitam nibbebhâgiyam kusalam* (Dî.-***  

*Ţî.-*1: 126, *Ma.- Ţî.-* 1: 257). 

1. To  be  completely  endowed  with  *upanissaya*,  powerful  support  to  *paccekabodhi ñâņa*,  fulfilling *pâramî*s (the perfections) and acquiring meritorious deeds,  

relevant to *paccekabodhi ñâņa*, have to be practiced and cultured for innumerable years and a hundred thousand eons. 

2. Among  the  three  *sâvakabodhi  ñâņa*s,  special  *pâramî  kusala*  relevant  *aggasâva- kabodhi ñâņa –* building up of knowledge –  has to be cultivated by *aggasâvaka*s throughout the period of innu-merable years and a hundred thousand eons. 
2. To acquire *mahâsâvaka* *bodhi ñâņa*s – building up of knowledge, the *mahâsâvaka*s have to culture *pâramî kusala* relevant to the *mahâsâvaka bodhi*  

*ñâņa* for hundred thousand eons. 

4. To be possessed of the *pakatisâvaka bodhi ñâņa* the *pakatisâvaka*s have to cultivate in 

the past the *nibbedhabhâgiya* = the special *pâramî kusala* that can breakdown the massive *kilesâ*, and are said to be endowed with *upanissaya sampanna* = a powerful *upanissya* the great support.  These can be cultured  by virtue of *vivuţţa* the deliverance***  

from rounds of rebirth as its support  (Dî.-** *Ţî.-*1: 126, *Ma.- Ţî.-* 1: 257). 

To be completely endowed with *sâvaka bodhi ñâņa*, the *pakatisâvaka*s should possess special *nibbedha bodhiya kusala*.  It is cultivated in the past as good  seeds of *vijjâ* and *carana*,   such  as  the  mass  of  *lobha,  dosa,  moha*,  etc.,  having  the  penetrative  power  of breaking down these massive *kilesâ*.  This is contrast to the assertion that *pâramî* is not required in acquiring the *sâvaka bodhi ñâņa*.  According to the above explanations, culture of *dâna, sîla, samatha*, referred to here as the good seeds of *carana*, the destruction of *rûpa- nâma* to the attainment to knowledge of wisdom in the past to their ultimate realities, are all *nibbedha-bhâgiya  kusala*s  which  help  disseminate  the  mass  of  *kilesâ*.   This  attainment already of *nibbedha-bhâgiya kusala* *pâramî* is a prerequisite for acquiring the *sâvaka bodhi ñâņa*.   Pointing out Saccekka Paribâjaka and frog-devâ as examples (in story of Maņţuka- deva putta),  the Reverend Letî Sayâdaw has indicated that the *nibbedha-bhâgiya kusala* *pâramî*  fulfilled in previous two or three exsitences are adequate to acquire the  *pakatisâvaka bodhi ñâņa*.  He also exaplined that at least the exercise on the four great elements to the attainment of their ultimate realities has to be accomplished.  So much the better if one is possessed of the *nâma-rûpa pariccheda* *ñâņa*,  

*pacceya pariggaha ñâņa* and *vipassanâ ñâņa*. 

In association with the story of the Rev Bâhiyadâruciraya Mathera, the Sayâdaw has explained the process of exercise *Diţţhe Diţţhamattam*.  Since this process is relevant  

to mediation by way of Sampajañña method, a brief description will be made of it.*  

***Diţţhe* – *Diţţhamattam* Method of Meditation** *Tasamâhita te bâhiya evum sikkhatabbam* –  

“*Diţţhe Diţţhamattambhavissati, sute sutamattam bhavissati*, *mute mutamattam  bhavissati*, *viññâte viññâmattam bhavissatî”ti*.  *Evañhi te bâtiya sikkhitabbam.* 

*Yato kho te bâhiya diţţhe diţţhamattam bhavissati, sute sutamattam bhavissati*, *mute mutamattam bhavissati*, *viññâne viññâmattam bhavissati*, *tato tun bhâhiya na tena*.  *Yato tun bâhiyana tena*, *tato tun bhâhiya na tattha*.  *Yato tun bhâhiya na tattha*, *tato tun bhâhiya nevidha na huram na ubhayamantarena*.  *Esevunto dujjhassâti* (*Khu*.- 1: 85 – 86,  UdânaPâļi). 

My dear son Bâhiya …. In this *sâsanâ* you should make every effort to concen-trate as given below. 

1. If you visualized the *rûpârammana* by virtue of *cakkhu*-*viññâna*, you should practice just to see. 
1. If you hear the *saddhârammana* by way of *sotaviññâna*,* you should practice just to hear. 
1. If you come into contact with  *gandhâramana* by *ghânaviññâņa*, *rasârammana* by *jîvhâviññâņa*, *phoļabbârammanana* by *phoļabbâviññâņa*¸ you should practice just to sense the contact. 
1. If you sense the *dhammârammana* by *manoviññâņa*, you should practice just to  

have the sense of them. 

My dear son Bâhiya …. Make effort to meditate in this way.  Then, you would be able to acquire the six modes of *ârammana* which are *diţţha-suta-muta* and *viññâta* as  

given below. 

1. If you happen to visualize *rûpârammana* via *cakkhu-viññâna*, then it would be just seeing it. 
1. If you happen to hear the *saddhârammana* by way of *sotaviññâna*, then it would be just bearing it. 
1. If  you  happen  to  come  into  contact  with   *rasârammana*  by  *jîvhâviññâņa*, *phoļabbârammanana* by *phoļabbâviññâņa*¸*gandhâramana* by *ghânaviññâņa*, then it would just be sense of contact. 
1. If you happen to sense the *dhammârammana* by *manoviññâņa*, you should, it  

would then be just having the sense of them  

My dear son Bâhiya …. Then you would not have attachment on these ârammana via *râga*, commit no offence by *dosa*,  ignorant by way of *moha* the nature of the *ârammana* = no delusion.  (Vision, hearing, contact, realization do not occur in associa- 

tion with *raga dosa*, and *moha*).  Then, my dear son Bâhiya …. There exist in you no  *diţţha-suta-muta-viññâta* of *ârammana* (associated with *râga*-*dosa*-*moha*). 

My dear son Bâhiya …. If there exist no *ârammana* of *diţţha-suta-muta-viññâta*  associated with (associated with *râga*-*dosa*-*moha*), then they would not also exist in 

1. In your present life nor 
1. In your life after death, nor 
1. In both the present life and life after death. 

Their non-existance in both the present and the life after death means the 

termination of kilesa-dukkha and *samsarâ-vuţţa dukkha*.  This is what the Buddha has expounded (Khu.-1: 58, UdânaPâļi). 

1. ***Diţţhe diţţhamattanti*** *rûpâyatane cakkhuviññâņena diţţhe diţţhamattam* 

*bhavissati*.  *Cakkhuviññâņenam hi rûpe rûpamattameva passati*, *na niccâdisbhâvum*. *Iti sesaviññânehipi me ettha rûpa diţţhamattameva cittam bhavissatîti attho* (*Sam*.- *Ţţha.-* 3: 28). 

***Cakkhuviññâņena  diţţhe  diţţhamattanti**  cakkhuviññânassa  rûpâyatanam  yattako gahaņâkâro,  tatthakam*.   *Kittakam  pamâņanti  atthasamvediyam  parassana  na dissitabbam*,  *kappanâmattam  rûpam*.   *Tenâha  ”**cakkhuviññâņamhî”**tiâdi*.   ***Rûpe**ti rûpâyatane*.   ***Rûpamattamevâ**ti  nîlâdibhedam  rûpâyatanamattam*,  *na  nîlâdi*.

***pî**ti* *javanaviññâņehipi* (*Sam*.-** *Ţî.-* 2:301 – 302). 

According  to  ***Diţţhe  diţţhamattam***  seeing  the  *rûpârammana*  by   way  of  *cakkhu*- *viññâna*, try to realize its attributes.  In seeing various *rûpârammana*s the *cakkhuviññâna* does know the color brown, gold etc., nor the nature of *nicca* and *anicca*, but just that they are  colors.   In  the  same  way,   in  concentrating  by  *cakkhu*-*dvârikaviññâna*, *manodvârikaviññâna*,  on the *rûpârammana*, concentrate on (not the various colors) just the state of being colors.  This is the real meaning of *Diţţhe diţţhamattam*.  It is the first 

method.  Not satisfied with the first, a second method was explained. 

2. *Atha  vâ  diţţhe  diţţham  nâma  cakkhuviññâna*,  *rûpe-rûpa-vijjânananti  attho*.  

***Mattâ**ti pamâņam*, *diţţha mattâ assâti diţţha mattam*, *cittam cakkhuviññattameva me cittam bhavissati attho*.  *Idam vattam hoti – yatthâ âpâthagata-rûpe cakkhuviññânam na rijjati na dussati na muyhati*,  *evum râgâvirahena cakkhuviññâņam mattameva javanam*  

*bhavissati*, *cakkhuviññâņa pamâņenva javanam ţţhapassamîti* (*Sam*.- *Ţţha.*- 3: 29). 

***Diţţhamnâma cakkhuviññâņam** rûpâyatanassa dassanti katvâ*.  *Te nâha ”**rûpa rûpa- vijânenan**”ti*.  ***Cakkhuviññâņamattamevâ**ti yatthakam cakkhuviññâņam rûpâteņa gahaņa mattam*, *tammattameva me sabbam  cittam bhavissatîti attho*.  “*Râgâdihiharenâ”*  

*ti vâpaţţho* (*Sam*.- *Ţî.-*2: 302). 

*Ittha rûpâyatanam passitabbadiţţhena diţţham nâma*, *cakkhuviññâņam pana saddhim  tamdvârikaviññâņehi dassana ţţhena* (*Udâna* – *Ţţha.-* 92). 

According to ***Diţţha*** in ***Diţţhe*,**  make* sure that ***Diţţha*** acquired.  It is named** *diţţha* because *cakkhuviññâņa* bears the meaning of ability to realize the *rûpârammana* (the  material object).  (It means only the color of the *rûpârammana* is realized). 

***Matta*** refers to a measure of size. 

***Diţţhamatta*** refers to continuity of consciounsness of *javana-vîthi-citta*.  (It is the continuity of consciousness of *manodvâra-vîthi-citta* which continue to have impulsion  

of the *rûpârammana* via *cakkhu-dvâra-vîthi*). 

What is really means is ‘I will exercise in such a way that the consinuity of the consciousness of *javana-vîthi-ciita* of mine must have the speed of the magnitude of the *Cakkhuviññâņa*. 

When  the  *rûpârammana*,  acquired  through  the  eye-door,  arises,  then  the  *cakkhuviññâņa* should not have attachment* (no *raga*), nor offence (no *dosa*), nor ignorant of it real nature (no *moha*).  (The mind and mental concomitants which can arise in association during *cakkhuviññâņa* and a *cittakkhaņa* are only the seven modes of *sabba*-*cittasâdhâraņa*.  The *raga, dosa* and *moha* are not include nor associated with these *nâma*  

*dhamma*s. 

In this way the continuity of consciousness of *javana-vîthi-citta* of the magnitude of *cakkhuviññâņa* and free of *râga* etc., would be cultivated, and javana citta of *cakkhu- viññâņa* magnitude will be maintained. 

Accoding  to  this  annotation  the  term  *diţţhe  diţţhamattam*  mean  that  just  as  the *cakkhuviññâņa* is not associated with *râga*, *dosa* and *moha*, if the *rûpârammaņa* is taken as object in continuation, then these *javana-vîthi-citta* should also be free of  *râga*, *dosa* and *moha*.  (The method of exercise will be given later).  A third method has been again  annotated by by the *aţţhakkathâ*. 

3. *Attha vâ diţţham nâma cakkhuviññâņâne diţţha-rûpam*, *diţţhe diţţhamattam nâma tattheva uppannam sampaţicchana-santîraņa-voţţhabbana sañkhâtam cittattayam*. *Yathâ tam na* 

*rajjati na dussati na muyhati*, *evum âpâthagate rûpe teneva sampaţicchanâ dippamâņena javanam uppâdassâmi*, *nâham tam pamâņam atikkamittvâ rjjanâdivasena*  

*uppajjantum dissâmîti ayamittha attho*. _Eseva nayo **Sutamutesu**_** (_Sam_.- _Ţţha._- 3: 29) 

***Diţţham nâma** padatthato cakkhuviññâņena diţţham –rûpam*.  ***Atthevâ**ti cakkhu Viññâņena diţţhamatte rûpe*.  ***Cittattayam** diţţhamattam nâma cakkhuviññâņam viya  ragâdiviharena pavattanato*.  *Tenâha “**yathâ tan**”ti âdi*  (*Sam*.- *Ţî*.- 2: 302). 

*Rûpâyatanam passitabbâţhena diţţham nâma* (*Upâda*-*Ţţha*. 82), according to which the *rûpârammaņa* is in essence *diţţha* (vission) because of the fact that its realization is made via *cakkhuviññâņa*  (visual  cognition).   Therefore,  in  this third  method  the *rûpârammana* which can be perceived by way of *cakkhuviññâņa* is the *diţţha*.  It is just a *matta* (measure) in visual  cognition  of  the  *ârammaņa*,  and  in  so  doing  the  three  *citta*s,  referred  to  as *sampaţicchana-santîraņa-vuţţho*, arise free of *râga-dosa-moha*.   

Because of this, it is called ***diţţhamatta***. 

Just as the combination of the three *citta*s have non-attachment, non-offence, and the non-delusion with regard to the *rûpârammaņa*, so also in the case of the *rûpâ-rammaņa* that impinges  on  the  visual  cognition.   I  would  cultivate  by  continuity  of  consciousness  my measure of *sampaţicchana-santîraņa-vuţţho* free from *râga-dosa-moha*.   Make effort to with such determination “I would not allow the attachment, offence or delusion to arise overriding the *sampaţicchana-santîraņa-vuţţho*.  This is what it is all about.  (This is also true in case of *suta*-*muta* (what is seen and thought).  The way to exercise to get delivered from *raga-dosa- moha* will be described later) (*Sam*.- *Ţţha.*- 3: 29). 

***Viññâte Viññâtamattam*** 

***Viññâte viññâtamattam**ti ettha pana viññâtam nâma manodvârâvajjanena viññâtâ- rammaņam*, *tassamim viññâte viññâtamattanti âvijjanapanâņam*.  *Yathâ âvijjanena na rijjati na dussati na muyhati*, *evum rijjanâdivasena uppacchitom adatvâ âvijjanapamâ-* 

*neņena cittam ţhapassâmîti ayamettha attho* (*Sam*.- *Ţţha.*- 3: 29).*** 

***Manodvârâvijjanena** **viññâtârammanam** viññâtanti adhippetam râgâdiviharena  viññeyyato*.  *Tenâha “**yathâ âvajjanenâ”**tiâdi* (*Sam*.- *Ţî.*- 2: 302). 

`           `*Viññâta*, as given in *viññâte viññâtamattam* refers to the *ârammaņa* that is realized 

by  virtue  of  *manodvârâvajjana*  (advertence  to  the  threshold  of  mind).   [The  *manodvârâ vajjana* can take, as object (of thought), each of the six modes of *ârammana* correspond- dingly.   Here, the object refers to that of *vipassanâñâņa* called the *dhammârammaņa*.   The inference have been  made as *rûpârammana* from aspect of *diţţha*,  *saddârammana* from aspect  of  *suta*,  *gandhâ-rammana*,  *rasârammana*,  and  *phoļabbârammana*  from  aspect  of *muta*.  Because of this in asmuchas the *viññâta* is concerned, *pasâda-rûpa*, 

*sukhuma-rûpa*  and  *lokî-citta-cetasika*,  that  should  arise  in  your  *santâna*  ,  the  objects  of vipassanâ, the constituents of *dhammârammana*, should be firmly cultivated.  Therefore, the *diţţha-suta-muta-viññâta* refer to all the 6 modes of objects.  If complete modes of objects are taken as object of concentration, by means of *vipassanâ ñâņa*, to the attainment of ultimate reality up to elemental state, then there is no more objects of  

concentration left.] 

In  the  *ârammana*,  called  *viññâta*  which  realizes  by  way  of  *manodvâra-vajjana*, ***viññâtamatta*** is the continuity of consciousness having a measure of the *manodvâra-vaj- jana*.  As I  exercise on the non-attachment, non-offence, non-delusion of the *viññâta* factors by virtue of *manodvâra-vajjana*, so would I keep the continuity of *javana-citta* by a measure of *manodâra-vajjana*  (= continuity *manodvârika-javana-vîthi citta*).  This is what is meant by *viññâta-mattam* (*Sam*.- *Ţţha.*- 3: 29). 

‘You the gentleman should recollect the *nâma* *kamaţţhâna*’*  is the essence when the explanations above are taken in brief. 

Concentrate  once  again  on  the  collection  of  *cetasika  dhamma*s  associated  with *pañcadvâra-vajjana* (the five sense doors), *cakkhu-viññâņa*, the seeing consciousness, (*sota- viññâņa*,  *ghâna-viññâņa*,  *jivhâ-viññâņa*,  *kâya-viññâņa*),  *sampaţicchana,  santîraņa,  vattho* and *manodvâra-vajjana*.  The so associated *cetasika*s are entirely free of *raga*, *dosa*, *moha*.  Therefore,  no  mind  of  attachment,  nor  of  offence,  nor  of  delusion  will  arise  along  with *rûpârammaņa* or any other related ones.  Similar to this practice, make effort to concentrate on the *javana citta*s arising in association with the continuity of the  

thought process.  How could one practice to be free from *raga*, *dosa*, *moha*? 

***Ñâtapariññâ Tîranapariññâ*** 

*Iti  bhagavâ  bâhiyassa  samkhitta  rucitâya  sahi  viññâņakâyahi  saddhim  saţţhârammaņa- bhedabhinnam  vipassanâya  vissayam  diţţhâdîhi  catûhi  koţţhâssehi  vibhajitvâ  tatthassa ñâtatîraņapariññam  dasseti*.   *Katham?

Ayamettha adhippâyo sidâdîsupi*  (*Udâna-Ţha.-* 82,  *Anuţî-* 2: 183). 

The Buddha expatiated the *dhamma* in an abridged form to Bâhiya to his liking. The six  modes  of  *ârammaņa*  –  the   *rûpârammaņa*,  *saddârammaņa*,  *gandhârammaņa*, *phoļabbârammaņa*  and  *dhammârammaņa*  –  together  with  the  6  modes  of  *viññâņa  – cakkhuviññâņa*, *sotaviññâņa*,  *ghânaviññâņa*, *jîvhâviññâņa*, *kâyaviññâņa* and *manoviññâ-ņa*.  The six modes of *ârammaņa*, the objects of *vipassanâñâņa*, are taken as  

1. *Diţţha dhamma* 
1. *Suta dhamma* 
1. *Muta dhamma* 
1. *Viññâta dhamma* 

which are the six modes of *kuţţhâsa* = make analysis by group by group.  Bâhiya has been instructed to exercise on  *ñâtapariññâ* and *tîranapariññâ* from among the six modes  

of *viññâņa* and the six modes of *ârammaņa*. 

In way was the instruction made?  See the following 

1. Because of the fact that *rûpârammaņa* can be seen by *cakkhuviññâņa*, it is called *diţţha*.  It is a phenomenon that can be discerned. 
1. *Cakkhudvârikavîthi*,  the  eye  door  thought  process  (*manodvârikavîthi  citta*  which continued  taking  *rûpârammaņa*  as  the  object  of  concentration),  together  with *cakkhuviññâņa*,  bears  the  meaning  of  *diţţha*  because  of  its  ability  to  discern  the *ârammaņa*.  These are phenomenal groups that have the ability to discern.  (These words indicate the *nâma-rûpapariccheda*-*ñâņa* – analytical knowledge of mind and matter). 
1. The discerned and the discerning phenomena are just ones that can arise only when conditioned by relevant causes.  In these phenomena, there are no *atta* (self) that could  create  nor  the  created.   (These  words  describe  how  one  could  culture  the discerned and the discerning phenomena by virtue of *paccaya-pariggaha*- *ñâņa*.   The *nâma-rûpapariccheda*-*ñâņa*  and  *paccaya-pariggaha-  ñâņa*  are,  infact,  the  *ñâta- pariññâ*.) 
1. The discerned and the discerning groups, arising by relevant causes, are of just a phenomenal nature.  The are the *dhamma*s the bears the nature of 
1) *anicca* (impermanence) as they arise and then perish away 
1) *dukkha* (suffering) as they exert relentless torturing and suffering 
1) *anatta* (non-self) as they never arise in the way one wishes them to be. 

If you, a gentleman, have been exercising *vipassanâ* on the three-fold characters as above, there is no way the *raga*, *dosa*, and *moha* can arise in your *santâna*.  This is, indeed, the actual meaning of the terms *diţţhe* and *diţţhamattam* in this *sâsanâ*.  It is also true for *suta-muta-vita*.  (With these words the *sammasanañâņa* and *udayabbayañâņa*, referred to as *tîraņapariññâ*, have been stated).  (Transaltion has been made as  given in  

*Anuţî-* 2: 183,  ***Ayañhettha adhippâyo*, *esa nayo sutâdîsup***). 

**Meditation in Brief** 

1. ***Diţţha***  (a)  Discernible *dhamma*s or phenomena  =  *rûpârammaņa* 

(b)  Discerning *dhamma*s  =  *cakkhudvâravîthi, manodvâravîthi dhamma*s        of *nâma dhamma* groups 

2. ***Suta***       (a)  Heard *dhamma*s = *saddârammaņa* 

(b)  Hearing *dhamma*s = *sotadvâravîthi, manodvâravîthi dhamma*s of  

`      `*nâma dhamma* groups 

3. ***Muta***  (a)  Contact *dhamma*s       –   1.  *Gandhâramaņa* 
2. *Rasâramaņa* 
2. *Phoļabbâramaņa* 

(b)   Contacting  *dhamma*s    1.  *Ghânadvâravîthi*  –  *Manodvâravîthi  nâma*                                                                                *dhamma* groups 

2. *Jîvhâdvâravîthi*  –  *Manodvâravîthi  nâma*         

`                                                                       `*dhamma* groups 

3. *Kâyadvâravîthi*  –  *Manodvâravîthi  nâma*         

`                                                                       `*dhamma* groups 

4. ***Viññâta***   (a)  Realized *dhamma*s  –  *Dhammâramaņa* 

(b)  Realizing *dhamma*s  –  *Manodvâravîthi nâma-dhamma* groups   

First of all,  try to concentrate on the above four modes – *diţţha-suta-muta-viññâta dhamma*s – the massive *rûpa*s and *nâma*s to their ultimate realities, and analyze  

by virtue of *nâņa.*  (This method of concentration explained *sensu lato* in previously). 

Then try to find the causes of these *rûpa*s and *nâma*s, and concentrate on the causal relationship.  (It will be clear in *Paticcasamuppâda* and *Paccaya-pariggha nâņa* section). 

Then again exercise vipassanâ on the three characters of the cause together with *rûpa- nâma dhamma*s.  (It will be clear in section on Vipassanâ).  After this, the Buddha  

instructed Bâhiya works to be continued beginning with a phrase ***Yato kho te Bâhiya* –**  

**To the *Pahânapariññâ* Destination** 

*Idâni ñâtîraņapariññâsu patiţţhitassa upari saha maggaphalena pahânapariññam  dassetum “**yato kho te Bâhiyâ**”tiâdi âraddham* (*Udâna*-*Ţţha.-* 82*, Anuţî-* 2: 183). 

With reference to this statement when *diţţha-suta-muta-viññâta* *dhamma*s have been contemplated to the attainment of *udabbayañâņa*, *vipassanâ* concentration must be made on *bhañgañâņa*  to  acquire  higher  *vipassanâ*  *ñâņa*  and  *magga-ñâņa*  and  *phaļa-ñâņa*  (It  will become clear in section on Vipassanâ).  With a view to the attainment of the  *arahatta-phaļa-ñâņa*, the Buddha exhorted to Bâhiya the following. 

My  son  Bâhiya  ….Exert  your  effort  to  concentrate  this  this  way.   Suppose  that sometimes  you  might  just  discern,  hear,  touch,  realize  the  phenomena  *diţţha-suta-muta- viññâta*.  And also suppose the you would not have attachment with *raga*, nor offence with *dosa*  nor  *moha*  on  the  *diţţha-suta-muta-viññâta*  *dhamma*s.   (Inability  to  discern  these *dhamma*s to the attainment of their *paramatta*, or failure to acquire *viapssanâ* *ñâņa* is  

said to be deluted). 

My son Bâhiya …. Sometimes it might happen that you are not attached with *raga*, nor offend with *dosa*, nor delutioned with *moha*, on the *diţţha-suta-muta-viññâta* *dhamma*s.  Then you will not be associated with these three, then you would not have *raga*, *dosa* and *moha*  on  *diţţha-suta-muta-viññâta*  *dhamma*s.  [***Ettha  vatâ  pahânapariñâm  mattakam pâpattatvâ khîņâsavabhûmi dassitâ*** = With this much words, the Lord has shown the  plane of Arahants who have peaked in attaining the**  *pahânapariññâ*, and in  

whom *kilesâ* (defilement) and *âsava* (canker) have been eradicated (*Udâna*- *Ţţha.-*82)] 

Then, my son Bâhiya …. These will not arise in you 

1. In *paccuppana loka* (the present realm of existence) 
1. In next existence (life after death) 
1. In the present and next existences. 

The Buddha has expounded that not arising in the present and the next existences  indicate the end of suffering from defilement and of the rounds of rebirth (*Khu*.-1: 85-86). 

- The Buddha Rev Bâhiya-Dâruciya Mathera  has fulfilled his *pâramî* for attainment of *Khippabhiñña Etadañga* for a hundred thousand eons commencing from the time of the Buddha Padumuttara, especially cultivating an Arahant’s *dhamma* for twenty thousand years, and lastly exercising the  *vipassanâ* on top of a mountain at the risk of his life. One must be careful not to compare one’s newly acquired *pâramî*, still in in its young state, with the matured and longed acquired  *pâramî* of the Mathera.  In this case the *pâramî* plays an important  role.   The  Rev  Bâhiya-Dâruciya  Mathera  is  a  Khippâbiñña  Arahant  who  has acquired *Paţisambhidâ ñâņa* (discrimatory knowledge)*.*  The noble ones who have cultured *Paţisambhidâ ñâņa* have performed, during the time of early Buddhas’ *sâsanâ*, the functions of *gatipaccâgatikavatta* and have practiced *vipassanâ* meditation to  

the attainment of *sañkhâ*-*rûpakkhâ ñâņa* (Visuddhi- 2: 72). 

***Pubbayogo** nâma pubbâbuddhânam sâsane gatapaccâ-gatikabhâvena yâva anuloman* 

*gotarabhusamipam*, *tâva vipassanâ-nuyogo* (Visuddhi- 2: 72).*   

Now the section on ***Asammoha sampajaña***, the remaining portion of the Pâļi –  *Abhikkante Paţikante –* will be treated. 

***Asammohasampajañña***

Realization without confusion of the *paramatta*  in going forward or backward is known as the ***asammohasampajañña*.**  Now understand *asammohasampajañña* in the  

way as given below. 

Lacking eye of wisdom for *paramatta*,  the *andhabâla*-*puthujana* (the blind stupid worldling) would understand, with *tahnâ diţţhi*, going forward etc. as *atta* (self), *atta* would make going forward possible, or “I am going forward,I would make myself go  

forward.   

The yogâvacara (meditator) recluse who belives in the Buddha’s Sâsanâ, who has succeeded in culturing *rûpa* and *nâma* masses by breaking them down to ultimate reality by means of *ñâņa* (Ghanavitabbhogena – *Sî*-*Ţî* – 246), would not have confusion, nor wrong view like the blind stupid man.  In the recluse if realization of “going” arises in his mind together with the *cittasamuţţhâna* *vâyodhâtu*, included in the* mind-produced *kalâpa*s, will cause body behavior = *kâyaviññatta*-*rûpa* to arise in him.  Because of the spread throughout the body of  mind-produced, and having high natural powers, *rûpa*-*kalâpa*s of the *vâyodhâtu*, the *rûpa*-*kâya* = all the *rûpa dhamma*s as noted in the field of *paramatta*-*saccâ* (taken as all the *catusamuţţhânika rûpa dhamma*s in the field of *para*-*matta saccâ*), the going forward as the whole skeletal mass moves forward.  (Speaking by language of *sammuti*-*saccâ*, moving forward can happen only when the bones and the  

corresponding joints are strong.) 

1. The realization of going forward by *paramatta*-*saccâ* is forward movement of the all the *rûpa dhamma*s and of the bones and corresponding joints by *sammuti saccâ*.  In each raising of a leg = going upward, the *tiharaņa*, become inferior, weak and without force.  But *tejo dhâtu* and *vâyo dhâtu* become superior and full of strength.  (The raising and lowering of the leg in each step will be referred to as “raising.”).  the same applies to the following two. 
1. Directed forward – *atiharaņa*  
1. Swinging the leg = bring the leg back to its usual position – *vîtiharaņa*. 

[*Tejo dhâtu*, which always follows the *vâyo dhâtu*, is the cause of rasing and lowering the leg for which the two *dhâtu*s are described as being preeminent.  Indeed the *tejo dhâtu* has the nature of raising the leg up and bringing it high up.  That in rasing the *tejo dhâtu* has the nature of always following the *vâyo dhâtu* is quite evident.  The commentator has explained in  such  a  way  as  to  make  explicitly  of  the  preeminence  of  *vâyo*  *dhâtu*  and  *tejo  dhâtu*, following the former, in rasing the leg and inferiority and weakness of the *pathavî dhâtu* and *âpo dhâtu* at the same time.  Again the  *tejo dhâtu*, which always follows the *vâyo dhâtu*, are the cause of  leading forward = *atiharaņa*, swinging sideways and bringing back =*  rasing and lowering the leg = *vîtiharaņa*. In fact, there is excessive power together with anxiety in *atiharaņa* and *vîtiharaņa* of the *vâyo dhâtu* that tends to go athwart.  In this way, the fact that *tejo dhâtu* always follows the  *vâyo dhâtu* always holds true.  Going beyond the place of standing = carry forward beyond standing leg is ***atiharaņa***.  Swinging the leg from standing position  away to avoid a stumbling block or a stump is ***vîtiharaņa***.  In other words,  bring the leg back to the standing position is the ***atiharaņa***, and moving  the leg forward or sideways from the   standing position is ***vîtiharaņa***  (*Thî*-*Ţî-* 247)*.*  Designated in this way, note that the  *atiharaņa* can be shortened as “lift” and *vîtiharaņa* as “swing.”] 

***Vosajjana***  In liftng of the leg (the stepping leg), the *tejo dhâtu* and *vâyo dhâtu* are inferior, weak and are of no strtength.  The *pathâvî* and *âpo dhâtu*s are very powerful and energetic.  Note that the same applies to the action of lowering down the leg = ***sanikkhepana***, set the leg on the ground = ***sannirujjhana*** have been differentiated. (In stepping, sending off of the leg forward to press down is the *vosajjana*, the act of putting the leg on the ground or the floor is the** *sanikkhepana*.  Pressing down the leg for a next 

step is the *sannirujjhana*.  (the whole processes has been shortened as the Lift-carry- 

carrying in between-release -down-press) 

1. *Uddharaņa* = lift 
1. *Atiharaņa*   =  carry (back to place of standing) 
1. *Vîtiharaņa  =*  carrying in between (between first and second step) 
1. *Vossajjana*  =  release (lowers the lifted leg for next step) 
1. *Sanikkhepana*  =  set leg on the ground 
1. *Sannirujjhana* = press on the ground (to carry the other leg forward) 

The  *rûpa*  and  *nâma*  *dhamma*s,  the  real  *paramatta*,  arising  at  the  moment  of  the *uddharaņa* = lifting the leg off the ground, would be not carried on leading to the moment of *atiharaņa* = leg standing on the ground.  Nor the *rûpa* and *nâma dhamma*s arising at the moment of carrying on to *vîtiharaņa* = the moment of taking over.  In the same way,  the *rûpa* and *nâma dhamma*s arising at the moment of taking over to  moment are not carried on leading to *vossajjana*, nor its *rûpa* and *nâma dhamma*s to that of *sanikkhepana*, nor its *rûpa* and *nâma dhamma*s to *sanikkhepana*.  The *rûpa* and *nâma dhamma*s arising at the moment of *sanikkhepana* do not get carried to the moment of the  

*sannirujjhana*. 

Only at a particular place, at a particular moment, section by section, joint by joint the movements are arising and disappearing like sesame seeds placed on a hot iron plate. [***Khaņamattâ vaļânato*** (*Sî*- *Ţî*- 248) static only for a moment as *Upâda*-*Ţhî-Bhañga*  (arising-static-perishing away).] 

In going forward and drawing back, which is the individual or a sentient being that is making such a movement?  Who is going forward, or making a movement forward?  No one.  It is just the continuous process of the mass of *rûpa* and *nâma*  

*dhamma*s moving repetitively forward and backward in new places. 

***Rûpâ rûpadhammâ**ti uddharaņâkârena pavattâ rûpadhammâ*, *tamsamuţţhâpatâ  arûpadhammo ca* (*Sî*- *Ţî*- 247, *Ma*- *Ţî*-1 : 358). 

Here  the  *rûpa*  and  *nâma*  *dhamma*s  of  lifting  the  leg  are,  in  fact,  the  *padhâna* (essential) *rûpa dhamma* or *apadhâna* (non-essential) *rûpa* *dhamma*,  i.e. the *rûpa dham* *-ma*s, in which are *citta* *samuţţhâna* *dhamma*s and which have the nature of the lifting, and those which are being lifted. And these are the *nâma dhamma*s.  what it means is that the *rûpa* and *nâma* *dhamma*s arising at each moment of the lift-carry-carrying in between-release -down-press process,  section by section, joint by joint process should be  

analytically discerned individually by virtue of *ñâņa*. 

For this reason the *Aţţhakathâ* has explained as given below. Indeed, moving when viewed from *Paramattha-dhamma-sabhâva*: 

1. In moving it is the *rûpa dhâtu*s and *nâma* *dhâtu*s only which are going.  
1. In standing it is the *rûpa dhâtu*s and *nâma* *dhâtu*s only which are standing still. 
1. In sitting it is the *rûpa dhâtu*s and *nâma* *dhâtu*s only which are sitting.  
1. In sleeping it is the *rûpa dhâtu*s and *nâma* *dhâtu*s only which are sleeping.  

The moving, stopping, sitting and sleeping are *kuţţhâsa*s in which the *rûpa* and  *nâma dhamma*s to gether with –  

1. Other *citta* has ceased. 
1. Still other *citta* has arisen anew. 

Take to heart, and concentrate by analytical knowledge that the process takes  

place continuously in this way.   Understanding of the moving forward and backward of the *rûpa  dhamma*s  and  *nâma  dhamma*s  to  the  attainment  of  their  *paramattha*  is  called *asammuyhana*  = realization without confusion = realizing the true nature.  Then be sure to understand that realizing the *paramattha* of these *dhamma*s without confusion is the  ***asammoha-sampazañña***. 

Here  then,  explanation  on  the  real  meaning  of  the  *abhikkante  paţikkante sampazânakâri hoti* =  the action of going forward or backward is usually made with *sampazañña* *ñâņa* has come to an end (*Abhi.*- *Ţţha* – 2: 339, *Ma*- *Ţî*-1 : 265). 

The method of meditation is similar to that of *Irriyâpatha* described in section on *Nâma* Kammatthâna. 

***Âlokite vilokite sampajânakâri hoti*** 

Looking straight and looking sideways are made with *sampajañña ñâņa*.    

Looking to front = looking straight ahead is termed *âlokita*.  Looking sideways = glancing is known as *vilokita*.  Looking up, down or back do not conform to devotion and respectable grace of a recluse, for which reason the Buddha did not expatiated.  Only these two kinds of looking conforms to an Arahant’s life.  In other words, all kinds of looking are led by the forward looking and looking sideways, are taken collectively as 

seeing (*Abhi.*- *Ţţha* – 2: 339 - 340, *Ma*- *Ţî*-1 : 265 - 266).   

**1.  *Satthakasampajañña***  

In the act of looking forward or sideways, if a will arises in one to do so, one should  be careful to consider if the seeing (the object) is of fruitful or not before actually doing so.  The ability to discriminately discern in this way is termed the  ***satthaka-sampajañña***.  How this *sampajañña* come into being should be understood by referring to  

Rev Ãnanda Mathera.  With regard to this, the Buddha has expounded as given below. 

Bhikkhûs ---- Suppose a *nanda* *Aranhant* (dear recluse) is about to look toward the east.  He did so first of all realizing that he has no intention of attaching to the *rûpâ*-*rammaņa* 

- *abhijjhâ* (wrongful thought) factor, grief = *domanassa* factor which are of inferior nature and *akusala dhamma*, would not arise in him.  After taking all these serially appearing factors to the heart, then he would look toward the east.  In this way, the recluse is endowed with the *sampajañña* *ñâņa* by which discrimination of beneficial or not of looking east is made.  The beneficial aspect is discriminated by the *sampajañña*  

*ñâņa*. 

Bhikkhûs ---- if a *nanda* *Aranhant* is 

1. About to look west.  R. 
1. About to look north. R. 
1. About to look south. R. 
1. About to look up. R. 
1. About to look down. R. 
1. About to look to corner. R. 

`   `Suppose a *nanda* *Aranhant* is about to look to a corner .  He did so first of all realizing that he has no intention of attaching to the *rûpâ*-*rammaņa* = *abhijjhâ* (wrongful thought) factor, grief = *domanassa* factor which are of inferior nature and *akusala dhamma*, would not arise in him.  After taking all these serially appearing factors to the heart, then he would look to the corner.  In this way, the recluse is endowed with the *sampajañña* *ñâņa* by which discrimination of beneficial or not of looking east is made.   

The beneficial aspect is discriminated by the *sampajañña* *ñâņa* ( *Am-* 3: 14, *Abhi.*- *Ţţha* –  

2: 340, *Ma*- *Ţî*-1 : 266). 

When the venerable Nanda Mathera exercising *vipassanâ bhâvana*, he has in mind “I have come to a state where I fail to observe these *indariya*s and consciousness based on which I have the perverted thought of unhappiness in the *sâsanâ*.  It  has been a shame.  From now on, I would relinquish these failures.”  In this way, he become possessed of *ussâha* (diligence),  powerful  shamefulness  and  frightfulness  the  *hiri-uttappa*  phenomena.   In observing that *indriya*, he has fulfilled the *paramî* for hundred thounsand eons for which he has come to possess *adhikâra kusala*.  Because of this possession, he has attained the peak in *indriyasamvara* the observation on the *indriya*.  For this reason  

the Lord has expounded to *nanda*-*arahants* as follows. 

*Etadaggam bhikkave mama sâvakânam bhikkhûnam indriyeysu guttadvârânam yadidam  nando* (*Am*.-1: 26). 

Bhikkhûs …. Among my disciples, who are mindful of and who observed the security of the *indriya*, the recluse Nanda is the best and the noblest of all.  He is regarded  

as the *Etadañga* (*Dî*-*Ţî-* 1: 249). 

2. ***Satthakasampajañña – Sappâyasampajâñña* In Another Way** 

In another way, as in going forward and backward, understand ***satthakasam-pajañña*** as well as ***sappâyasampajâñña*** by virtue of seeing a *cetiya* (shrine) etc.   (*Abhi*-*Ţţha*-2: 340). 

3. ***Gocarasampajañña*** 

*Kamaţţhâņassa  pana  avijahanameva  **gocarasampajaññam***.   *Tassamâ  khandhâ- dhâtuâyatanakamaţţhâņikehi attano kamaţţhâņavaseneva*, *kasiņâdikammaţţhânikehi vâ pana kamaţţhâna siseneva âlokanavilokanam kâtabbam* (*Abhi*-*Ţţha*-2: 340, *Ma*- *Ţţha*-1:  

266). 

Not  abandoning  the  *kamaţţhâna*  that  you  are  always  exercising  only  is  the *gocarasampajañña*.  Therefore –  

1. A  recluse  contemplating  on  the  five-fold  *khandhâ*,  the  *khandhakammaţţhânika* individuals, when looking straight forward or sideways, should concentrate only  

`      `on the five-fold *khandhâ* 

2. A recluse contemplating on the 12 modes of *âyatana*, the *âyatana kammaţţhânika* individuals, concentrate  on 4 *âyatana*s when looking straight forward, 4 *âyatana*s when looking sideways.   (It will be clear in later sections). 
2. An  arahant  contemplating  on  the  18  modes  of  *dhâtu*,  the  *dhâtukammaţţhânika* individuals, concentrate on the 4 *dhâtu*s when looking straight forward, the 4 *dhâtu*s when looking sideways. (It will be clear in later sections). 
2. An arahant concentrating on *kasiņa* (sign), *kasiņâdika* individuals,  concentrate on only the usual *kasiņakamaţţhâna*. 
2. If  a  meditator  contemplating  on  *ânâpânassati  samâdhi,*  the  *ânâpânakamaţţhânika*  individual, then look straight forward or sideways led by *ânâpânasatipaţţhâna*  

`      `(mindfulness of in-breathing and out-breathing). 

`      `What the above all mean is that if your meditation is at *samatha* stage only, then concentrate  on  the  *samatha*  *kamaţţhâna*  you  are  cultivating  when  you  looking  front  or sideways.  In the same way, if your meditation is at *vipassanâ* stage, then concentrate on any one the five-fold *khandhâ*, 12 modes of *âyatana*, the 18 modes of *dhâtu* etc., that you are culturing.  If you are meditating in this way, then you are a competent *gocara*-*sampajañña*.   According to these explanations, one can be said to be competent in  

*gocarasampajañña* as given below.    

Suppose a gentleman only at the stage of cultivating *samâdhi*, is concentrating on his *samatha* *kamaţţhâna* while moving to the front or the back, then he can be as  

competent with *gocarasampajañña*. 

If  a  gentleman  has  acquired *samâdhi*, based  on  which  he progressed  towards  the *vipassanâ*.   By exercising *vipassanâ* he moved to the front or to the back while discerning the *khandhâ*, *âyatana*, and *dhâtu*s – discerning on the *khandhâ*, *âyatana*, and *dhâtu*sa stage of acquiring the knowledge in their *paramatta*,* then the  *gocarasam-* 

*pajañña* and *asamohasampajañña* will be established in his *santâna*. 

**4.  *Asamohasampajañña*** 

Within the body there is no such a thing as *atta* that is forward-looking, nor the backward-looking *atta*.  If a consciousness arises having an intension of looking straight forward, then together with that consciousness arise the mind-produced *citta* *samuţţhâna* a *viññatta rûpa*, caused by *vâyo* *dhâtu*  which is  highly powerful with natural energy, will arise.   In this way, by virtue of the mind-derived *citta*, the lower eye-lid is pulled down, the upper eye-lid pulled up (= rises, blown out of course).  There, indeed is no one who has opened (make it open) the eye mechanically.  Then, the *cakkhu-viññâņa* arises making the function  of  vision  accomplished.   Understanding  discriminatively  in  this  way  is  called *asamohasampajañña* in *âlokite* (looking forward) and *vilokite* (looking  

backward) (*Abhi*-*Ţţha*-2: 340, *Ma*- *Ţţha*-1: 266). 

[N.B.  It is said that *cakkhu-viññâņa-citta* arises following the function of seeing. So this *cakkhu*-*viññâna* cannot arise without *pañca-dvâra* preceding it, without *sampaţic-chana- santiraņa-vuţţho*  following  it,  if  it  is  *mahantâramman*  without  *javana*  and  if  it  is *atimahantaja*-*vana* without *javana tadârammana*.  So, cultivate in your *cakkhu*-*viññâņa* the *cakkhudvâravîthi* *nâma* collections and *rûpârammaņa* which are not free from the  *avinâbhâva* ways.  The Aţţhakathâ Sayâdaw, willing you to cultivate this way, has once  again indicated as given below.] 

***Mûlapariññâ***  

**(The Root of Analytical Knowledge)** 

In another way –  

1. By virtue of *mûlapariññâna* 
1. By virtue of *âgantu =* of a guest 
1. By virtue of *mûlapariññâ* 
1. By virtue of *tâvakâlika* = of momentary existence  

Understand the ***asamohasampajañña*** in looking ahead and sideways.  First of all how the  ***asamohasampajañña*** arises by virtue of *mûlapariññâ* will be described. 

In looking straight or glancing at the *rûpârammana*, (*Bhavañaga*) the thought process arise in order of *pañcadvâra-vajjana*, *cakkhuviññâna*, *sampaticchana*, *santîraņa*,  

*vuţţho, javana*. 

Among those *citta*s, the *bhavañga* is the *vîthimutta*-*citta*  free of *vîthi*.  The *bhava* (life) between the period of birth to death is called *uppapatti bhava*.  The *bhavañga* arises at a time when the *vîthi*-*citta*s of the *bhava*, called *uppapatti*, have not arisen yet.  They  

help accomplish continuity  memtal processes of the causal factors of a *bhava*. 

When  the  *rûpârammaņa*  falls  on  the  *cakkhudvâra*  and  *manodvâra*,  the  *mano- dvârâvajjana citta*, called *kiriya*-*manodhâtu citta*, arises completing discerning *âvajjana*  

by activating (= stop) the *bhavañga*. 

The *cakkhuviññâņa* arises by discerning this *rûpârammaņa* following perishing  aways of the *cakkhuviññâņa*. 

The *sampaticchana*,* called *vipâka-mano dhâtu*, arises after completing discerning the same *rûpârammaņa*, which is the function of *sampaticchana*, and following the  

cessation of *cakkhuviññâņa citta*. 

Because of the cessation of *cakkhuviññâņa*, the  *santîraņa citta,* called *vipâka- mano citta dhâtu* arises after completing the investigating of the same *rûpârammaņa*. 

Because of the cessation of, the *vuţţho citta*, called *kiriyamano viññâņa dhâtu*,  arises following the determination of the *rûpârammaņa*  either as *iţţha* or  *aniţţha*. 

The seven modes of *javana* are apperceived after cessation of *vuţţho* *citta*. 

Among the seven *javana*, looking straight and sideways as “this is the woman, this is the man” by virtue of attachment, defilement and delusion, have not arisen even in the first, nor the second nor the 7th *javana*s.  If the 7 *javana*s got disarrayed, upside down, then looking  straight  and  sideways,  as  “this  is  the  woman,  this  is  the  man,”  by  virtue  of attachment, defilement and delusion, arises.  In looking to the front or sideways, realization of *asammoha sampajañña* must be made by virtue of ***mûlapariññâ*** (*Abhi*-*Ţţha-*2: 341). 

What the above means is as follows.  In *cakkhudvâravîthi* etc. of the *pañcadvâra*- *vîthi*,  the  understanding  and  realization,  such  as  “  woman  and  man,”   by  way  of  the attachment etc. has not occurred yet.  In that *pañcadvâravîthi*, there occurred the rising of just the *lobha* such as the *iţţha*  *rûpârammaņa* of a woman by virtue of *ayoniso manasikâra* (unwise  attention)  of  the  *pañcadvâravajjana*  and  *vuţţho*.   In  discerning  the  *aniţţha rûpârammaņa* of a woman, just the obdurateness of mind *paţigha* arises.  (It is not that realization of man and woman induce *raga*, *dosa* and *moha*, but just that the color as the *rûpârammaņa* resulting in the appearance of *lobha*, *dosa*  and *moha* do  

happen). 

*Manodvâre pana* “*iţţhî puriso*”*ti* *rajjanâdi hoti*.  *Tassa pañcadvâravajjanam mûlam*.  *Yathâvuttam vâ sabbam bhavañgâdi*.  *Evum manodvâravajjanassa mûlavasena*  

*mûla pariññâ vuttâ* (*Dî- Ţî-*1: 250).*  

But in *manodvâravîthi* attachment, offence and delusion arise by realization such as “this is the man, this is the woman.”  (Only at the *manodvâravîthi* did the realization, by way of attachment by *raga*, offence by *dosa* and delusion by *moha*, arise as  

discrimination of “the woman, and man.”  Refer to earlier parts of this section). 

The root of the causal factors for the arising of the *manodvâravîthi*, in which are included the *lobhajavana*, *dosajavana* and *mohajavana* such as the attaching, offending and deluting, are the *javana*.  In other words, they are the process of *pañcadvâravîthi* together with the *bhavañga*.  The realization analytically of *pañcadvâravîthi*s by virtue of  

roots of the causes of the *manodvâra javana* is called ***mûlapariññâ***. 

In  *âlokite*  and  *vilokite*  =  looking  to  the  front  and  sideways,  the  *aţţhakathâ*  has instructed to realize the formation of *asamoha-sampajana* by virtue of the *mûlapariññâ*.   

In looking this way, the following have to be concentrated analytically to the knowledge  

of their *paramatta*. 

1. *Cakkhudvârvîthi*  = *citta* + *cetasika* (mind and mentalconcomitants) = *nâma dhamma*s 
1. *Manodvâravîthi nâma dhamma*s which still take *rûpârammaņa* as the *ârammaņa* (the object of meditation).

If the meditator can concentrate in the way given above, then he has acquired the *asamoha-sampajana* by virtue of the *mûlapariññâ*. 

***Upalakkhaņa* method and *Nidassana* Method** 

As the components were to be appreciated, so are the composite of the compo-nents and such a method of realization is termed the ***upalakkhaņa*** method.  As a distinct part was indicated to be taken, the way of taking the whole of the parts are termed  the  

***nidassana*** method. 

In *sampajañña*, the Buddha has instructed to concentrate on *cakkhudvâravîthi* and *manodvâravîthi nâma dhamma*s which take *rûpârammaņa* as the object when looking  straight or sideways.  The instruction is as follows. 

The instruction was made to meditate on a certain obvious component referred to as *nâma dhamma* group which have the *rûpârammaņa* as the object.  This *desanâ*, there- 

fore,  expounded in *upalakkhaņa* way which can take all the six modes of *ârammaņa* as objects in a befitting way, that all the *nâma dhamma*s as a composite have to be concen- trated.  This is the *lakkhaņâhârenitti* method given in Nittipâļi as follows.  

*Vuttamhi ekadhamme*, *yedhammâ ekalakkhaņâ tena, Vuttâ bhavunti sabbe*, *iti vutto lakkhaņo hâro*. 

Among the six modes of *ârammaņa, nâmarûpa dhamma* groups which take *rûpâram-maņa* as the object, are instructed to concentrate on the *nâma dhamma* groups which takes the six- fold *ârammaņa* as object.  In one way it means that, being similar in taking *ârammaņa* as object, the *nâma dhamma* groups such as *sotadvâravîthi* etc., should also  

be concentrated upon in meditation. 

***Avinâbhâva* Way**.  As the instruction has been made to concentrate on the *nâma dhamma*  groups  which  take  on  *rûpârammaņa*  as  the  object,  this  is  the  way  in  which *rûpârammaņa* and the corresponding objects, not free from *vipassanâ bhâvanâ*, are to be cultivated.  It is because, in a realm of the five-fold *khandhâ*, called *pañcavokâra*, they are not  free  from  respective  objects  and  from  dependent  materials.   For  this  reason  the commentator himself will again instruct in *âlokite vilokite* that the five-fold *khandhâ* are  

to be concentrated.  (It will become clear later).  Concentrate on the following when –  

1) In discerning on the *rûpârammņa* as indicated in *âlokite vilokite* 
1) The *rûpârammņa* and corresponding material phenomenon 
1) Similar to the way to concentrating on the *cakkhudvâravîthi* – *manodvâravîthi*,        the *nâma dhamma* groups, which take *rûpârammņa* as object 
2) In hearing = *saddârammņa* 
1) The *saddârammņa* and corresponding material phenomenon 
1) Concentrating on the *sotadvâravîthi* – *manodvâravîthi*, the *nâma dhamma*        groups, which take *saddârammņa* as object 
3) In smell = *gandhârammņa* 
1) The *gadhârammņa* and corresponding supporting material phenomenon 
1) Concentrating on the *ghânadvâravîthi* – *manodvâravîthi*, the *nâma dhamma*        groups, which take *gandhârammņa* as object 
4) In sensation of taste = *rasârammņa* 
1) The *rasârammņa* and corresponding supporting material phenomenon

**The Nature of *Ãgantuka*  (The Nautre of Avisitor)** 

Again, if the the *rûpârammņa* has attained stage of being discerned at the *cakkhu*- *dvâra* (and *manodvâra*), the moving *bhañga* = at later stage above the  formation of the *bhavañga*-*calana*  (it  means  the  ceased  *bhavañga*  =  stationary  *bhavañga*  = *bhavañgupaccheda*),  and  their  respective  functions  accomplished, by  virtue  of  which  the *pañca*-*dvâravajjana*, *cakkhuviññâņa*, *sampaţicchana, santîraņa*, and *vuţţho* all have arisen and perished away.  At the end of all these, *javana* (impulsion) arises.  This *javana* is like the home  to  the  previously  arisen  *pañca*-*dvâravajjana*,  for  which  it  is  like  a  visitor  to  the *cakkhudvâra*.   If  the  hosts  remain  silent  towards  the  visitor,  who  came  into  to  ask  for something,  he  should  not  make  a  demand  for  what  he  wanted.   In  the  same  way,  the *cakkhudvâra*, the home for these *âvajjana* (*pañcadvâravajjana*) etc., the *vîthi*-*citta*s (thought 

processes) should not be attached, nor offend, nor delusioned towards the *rûpâ-rammaņa*, and  so  should  the  *javana*  be  towards  these   *ârammaņa*s.   Understand  the  *asammoha*- *sampajjaññâ* in the way what happened to the visitor (*Abhi*-*Ţha*-2: 341; *Ma-* 

*Ţha*-1: 267). 

*Pañcadvâravajjana*,  *cakkhuviññâņa*,  *sampaţicchana,  santîraņa*,  and  *vuţţho*  could realize just the color of a *rûpârammaņa*, and *javana vîthi*s could also arise having the same properties.  If the concentration can be made of the *javana* together with *cakkhudvâravîthi nâma  dhamma*  groups,  which  can  realize  just  these  colors,  to  the  attain-ment  and disintegration of the masses to their *paramatta*, then one said to have acquired the *asamoha- sampajañña*.  A meditator should make every effort to acquire the *asamoha*-*sampajaññâņa*.  As a visitor did not have attachment nor offence other’s material things, so should a meditator attempt concentration.  In addition, if *âvajjana* and *vuţţho*, included in the *cakkhudvâravîthi*, is taken to heart these *rûpârammaņa* by *ayonisomanasikâra* (wrong attention), then, it will be  influenced by *lobha-vajjana*, *dosa-javana*, and *moha-javana*, as the case may be.  The arising of these *javana*s is not due to *lobha-vajjana*, *dosa-javana*, and *moha-javana* produced by realizations as “this is the woman or the man.”  This is only due to attachment, offence, or delusion  based  on  the  realization  by  *ayonisomanasikâra*  of  only  the  color  of  the *rûpârammaņa*.  It is also not like attachment, offence or delusion on the living and non-living material bodies of a house owner on his possessions.  It is but like those of a visitor on the possession  of  his  host.   If  contemplation  could  be  made  by  a  meditator  of  these *cakkhudvâravîthi*, in which are included the *lobha-vajjana*, *dosa-javana*, and *moha-javana*, to their  ultimate  realities  (*paramatta*),  then  *asamoha-sampajaññâņa*  would  be  attained.   A meditator should make every possible effort to acquire this *asamoha-sampajaññâņa*.  This is what is meant by  

the above paragraph. 

**Nature of *Tâvakâlika* (The Temporary Nature)** 

At the *cakkhudvâra* arise, starting with *pañcadvârâvajjana* ending with *vuţţho*, the *citta*s.  These *citta*s, in association with corresponding *cetasika sampaytta dhamma*s, perish away  themoment  they  have  perform  their  respective  functions.   They  have  so  short  a durations  of  existence  that  they  did  not  realize  each  other.   They  are  related  to  their *tâvakâlika* the duration of their functions = a momentary period.  If all the occupants of a house died except one, then at that instant (= a condition of near death), dancing, singing by the remaining individual is not relevant.   In same way, the related *citta*s like *âvajjana* etc., which appears one after the other at the any one *dvâra* (door), perishd away as soon as their corresponding functions have been accomplished.  So also it is irrelevant to be attached, offended or delusioned towards the *ârammaņa* by *javana*-*citta*s at the remaining moment of the accomplished functions.  Understand the *asamoha-sampajaññâņa* by realizing that  there is a relationship between the functioning and time *tâvakâlika* =  

temporary moment. (*Abhi*-*Ţha*-2: 341; *Ma-Ţha*-1: 267). 

The *vîthi*-*citta*s within the corresponding *vîthi*s, such as *cakkhudvâravîthi*, toge-ther *sampayutta*-*cetasika* *dhamma*s accomplish their respective functions and perish away in the short moments.  This phenomenon should be discerned via *ñâņa*. The *vîthi*-*nâma dhamma* groups  appearing  at  the  six  *dvâra*s  (the  six  doors)  should  be  concentrated  and  if  the concentration could be promoted to vipassana meditation, then the *raga*, *dosa*, *moha* would not have the chance to made their appearance.  This means realization of the  

truth without delusion, the *asammoha*-*sampajjañña* could be acquired. 

Also understand *asammoha*-*sampajjañña* by virtue of *khandhâ*, *âyatana*, *dhâtu*,  *paccaya*-*paccavakkhaņa*. 

**Attainment of  *Asammoha*-*Sampajjañña* by  Virtue of Five-Fold *Khandhâ*** 

In looking straight ahead or sideways (during *cakkhu*-*viññâņa citta-kkhana*, a  thought moment of visual consciousness) 

1. *Cakkhu*-*viññâņa*  (visual  cognition)  and  *rûpârammaņa*  is  the  *rûpa*-*kkhandhâ aggregate clinging to material qualities*). 
1. *Cakkhu*-*viññâņa* which can discern the *rûpârammaņa* is the *viññâņâ-kkhandhâ*. 
1. *Vedanâ* associated* with *cakkhu*-*viññâņa* is the *vedana*-*kkhandhâ*. 
1. *Saññâ* associated with *cakkhu*-*viññâņa* is *saññâ*-*kkhandhâ*. 
1. *Phassa-cetanâ-ekaggatâ-jîvita-manasikâra* associated with the *cakkhu*-*viññâņa* is  the *sañkhâra*-*kkhandhâ*. 

If  these  five-fold  aggregates  get  united,  the  looking  straight  ahead  or  sideways  arise distinctly.  If so what person or the sentient being looks straight ahead and who looks  sideways? (*Abhi*-*Ţha*-2: 342; *Ma-Ţha*-1: 267 – 268).  

***Atthâ**ti pacakkhandhavasena âlokana-vilokene paññâyamâne tabbinimutto **ekâ eko  âloketi***, ***ko viloketi*** (*Dî*.- *Ţî.-*1: 250). 

If looking straight ahead or sideways have arisen by virtue of combination of the five- fold *khandhâ*, then who would look straight or sideways free from that five-fold *khandhâ*?  There is no such a person or sentient being lookin straight or sideways.  There   

only is the the five-fold *khandhâ*. 

The way the explanation are given in the above *Aţţhakathâ* are referred to as  ***Uppalakkhaņa method and Nidassa method*.** 

The five-fold *khandhâ* are meditated during *cakkhu*-*viññâņa citta-kkhana*.  So 

also each of the five-fold *khandhâ*  are concentrated  at every thought  moment located in *manodvâra*-*vîthi*s, which take as the *ârammaņa* the *manodvâra*-*vîthi* and *rûpârammaņa*.  If the five-fold *khandhâ* could be concentrated at every thought moment, then *asammoha  sampajjañña-ñâņa* is acquired.  The same applies to *sotadvâra*-*vîthi* etc. 

**Arising of *Asammoha Sampajjañña-ñâņa* by  Way of *Ãyatana*** 

In looking straight ahead or sideways (during a thought moment of visual cons- 

ciousness) 

1. The visual clearness element is termed *cakkhâyatana* (the eye-base) 
1. The *rûpârammaņa* is termed the *rûpâyatana* (visible object base). 
1. *Cakkhu*-*viññâņa* which can discern is termed the *manâyatana* (mind base). 
1. The seven modes of *sampayutta cetasika* associated with *cakkhu*-*viññâņa*, such as 

`      `*vedanâ* etc., are termed *dhammâyatana* (mental object base). 

`            `If  the  four  *âyatana*s  become  distinctly  united,  then  the  act  of  looking  straight  or sideways will appear clearly. If that is the case, what person or the sentient being looks  straight ahead and who looks sideways? (*Abhi*-*Ţha*-2: 342; *Ma-Ţha*-1: 267 – 268).  

If the looking straight or sideways clearly appear by virtue of the four modes of *âyatna*, then who would be looking straight and who sideways?  In fact, what it means is that there none looking straight nor sideways, but only the four modes of *âyatana*.  Here too understand that it is the *Uppalakkhaņa method and Nidassa method*.  At every *citta*-*kkhaņa*, situated in *cakkhudvâra*-*vîth*i and *manodvâra-vîthi*, if each of the four *âyatana* can taken as object  of  concentration,  then  the  *sampajjañña-ñâņa*  is  acquired.   The  same  applies  to *sotadvâra*-*vîthi* (the eye-door cognition process).  In this way the 12 modes of  

*âyatana* (sense-bases) will be completely covered. 

**Arising of *Asammoha Sampajjañña-ñâņa* by  Way of 18 Dhâtu*** 

In looking straight ahead or sideways (during a thought moment of visual cons- 

ciousness) 

1. The visual clearness element is termed *cakkhu-dhâtu* (visual element). 
1. *Rûpâyatana* (visible object base) is termed the *rûpa*-*dhâtu* (visible element). 
1. *Cakkhu*-*viññâņa*  which  can  discern  is  termed  the  *cakkhu*-*viññâņa*  *dhâtu*  (seeing consciousness element). 
1. The seven modes of *sampayutta cetasika* associated with *cakkhu*-*viññâņa*, such as 

`      `*vedanâ* etc., are termed *dhamma dhâtu* (mental element). 

`            `If  the  four  *dhâtu*s  become  distinctly  united,  then  the  act  of  looking  straight  or sideways will appear clearly. If that is the case, what person or the sentient being looks  straight and who looks sideways? (*Abhi*-*Ţha*-2: 342; *Ma-Ţha*-1: 267 – 268).  

If the looking straight or sideways clearly appear by virtue of the four *dhâtu*s, then who would be looking straight and who sideways?  In fact, what it means is that there none looking straight nor sideways, but only four the *dhâtu*s.  Here too understand that it is the *Uppalakkhaņa method and Nidassa method*.  At every *citta*-*kkhaņa*, situated in *cakkhudvâra*- *vîth*i and *manodvâra-vîthi*, each of the four *dhâtu*s must taken as object  

of concentration. 

In  this  way,  if  the  each  of  the  four *dhâtu*s  can be  concentrated  at  every  thought moment  during  the   *cakkhudvâravîthi*-*manodvâravîthi*,  then  the  *sampajjañña-ñâņa*  is acquired.  This is also true for *sotadvâra*-*vîthi* etc.  If concentration can be made in this  

way, all the 18 modes of *dhâtu* would have been completed. 

**Arising of *Asammoha Sampajjañña-ñâņa* by  *Paccya*-*Paccavekkhaņa* (Meditation on the Cause**) 

*Tathâ cakkhu nissaya-paccayo rûpam ârammaņa-paccayo*, *âvajjanam anantara-samantara- anantararûpanissaya natthiviugatapaccayo*, *âloko upanissayapaccayo*¸ *vedanâdayo sahajâtâdipaccayâ*.  *Evametesam paccayânam samâvâye âlokavilokanam* 

` `*paññâyati*.  *Tattha ko eko âloketi*, *ko viloketi* (*Abhi- Ţha.-*2: 342; *Ma. Ţha-*1: 268). 

“***Upanissayapaccayo**”ti idam suttantanayeyna pariyâyako vuttam*.  ***Sahajatapaccay**ti nidassnamattametam aññamañña-sampayutta-atthiavigatâdipaccayâ nampi labbhanato*  (*Dî*.- *Ţî*.-1: 250).***  

In looking straight or sideways (during a thought moment of visual consciouness) 

1. The visual clearness is the *pûrejâtanissaya paccaya* (a cause which renders support in the formation of *cakkhu*-*viññâņa* by competition between very early *atîtabhavañga* and  visual  clearness  and  among  *uppâda*s  before  the  *cakkhu*-*viññâņa*  made  its appearance). 
1. The *rûpârammaņa* is the *ârammaņa paccaya* (the *rûpârammaņa* is  the object of the *cakkhu*-*viññâņa citta*.  On when there is discernible object could the *viññâņa*, which can discern the object, be formed.  There would be no *viññâņa* without discernible object.  Therefore, for the appearance of *cakkhu*-*viññâņa* the *rûpârammaņa* presents itself as a cause and support in the form of object that is to discerned.) 

`      `The *pañcadvâra*-*vajjana* is the (a) *anantara*, (b) *samantara*, (c) *anantarûpanis-saya*, and (c) *vigata paccaya*.  These are the causes. 

(a)  It is unusual for two *citta*s to arise simultaneously.  One arises after the formation and perishing away of the another.  Therefore, only when *pañcadvâravajjana citta* has ceased can the *cakkhu*-*viññâņa citta* arise.  As long as the *pañcadvâravajjana citta* is still there, the *cakkhu*-*viññâņa  citta*  cannot  arise  as  yet.   The  *cakkhu*-*viññâņa  citta*  ceases  only  after supporting  the  arising  of  the  *cakkhu*-*viññâņa  citta*.    In  between  the  supporting  *pañca- dvâravajjana citta* and the supported *cakkhu-viññâ citta* there exist no separating phenol- menon. 

***NÃMARÛPAVAVATTHÃNA*** DETERMINATION OF ***NÃMA*** AND ***RÛPA*** 

**4.  *Nâmarûpavavatthâna* = Determination of *Rûpa* + *Nâma*** 

*So  evum   phassâdînam   vasena  upatthite  cattâro  arûipno  khandhe  nâmanti,  tesam  aramman abhûtâni  cattâri  mahâbhûtâni,  catunnañca  mahâbhûtâni  upâdâyarûpam  rûpanti vavatthapeti*.  *Iti at t hârassa dhâtuyo dvâdasâyatanâni pañcakkhandhâti sabbepi tebhûmake dhamme khaggena samuggam vivaramâno viya yamakakâlakandam  phâlaya-mâno viya ca nâmañca rûpañcâti dvedhâ vavatthapeti*.  *Nâmarûpamattato uddam  añño*  

*satto vâ puggalo vâ devo vâ byahmâ vâ nattîti nittam  gacchati* (*Visuddhi-*2: 227 - 228). 

When the meditator has clearly discerned the *rûpa* phenomena in his conscious-ness, so would the *nâma* phenomena be.  In such a discernment of the *nâma* factors, there are three ways: 

3. The method of concentration starting with *phassa* (contact), 
3. The method of concentration starting with *vedanâ* (suffering), 

\3.  The method of concentration starting with  consciousness *viññâņa* (perception). If the meditator concentrated on the *nâma dhamma*s via one of these three ways, then *vedanâ-saññâ-sañkhâra-viññâņa*, referred to as the four-fold *nâmakhandhâ*, are recog-nized as the ***nâmadhamma*s** which** will be acquired in his conscious mind.  *Mahâbhûta* = the four great elements and all the *upâdârûpa*s which take the four great elements as their object, are recognized as ***rûpa dhamma***s.  In this way the 18 elements, 12-fold *âyatana*s, the five-fold *khandhâ*s and all those factors in the three planes of existence = these innumerable *rûpa*- *nâma dhamma*s have been definitely and clearly defined.  It comes to the realization that there are just the *nâma* and *rûpa* in the three planes of life, above which there exist no higher ***individuality-sentient being-life-self-human-devâ-byahmâ***  

(*Visuddhi-*2: 227 - 228). 

According to the above instruction, when one is able to discern both *rûpa*+*nâma* at every thought along the path of cittaniyâma, then these *rûpa* + *nâma* are taken as object of concentration to discern that in these there are **no** **“individuality-sentient  being-life-self-human-*deva*-*byahmâ***, but **just the *rûpa* + *nâma***. 

The determination is made of the *rûpa*+*nâma* as explained above.  (When one has acquired the ability to extend his consciousness to *bhahiddha* and collectively meditate on the *bhahiddha rûpa*+*nâma* in the 31 planes, then one would clearly realize the non- 

existence of human-*devâ*-*byahmâ*). 

**An Invaluable Resolution** 

The Venerable Sayâdaw Mathera, referred to respectfully by the *desanâ* as  **Ãcariyadhammapâla**, has made an invaluable resolution in the domain of meditation in his Mahâtîkâ with respect to the above opening commentary. 

***Sabbepi  tebhûmake  dhamme  nâmañca  rûpañcâtî**ti  ittha  kiñcâpi  sabba  saddo anavasesapariyâdâyako*,  *nâmarûpabhâvo  pana  aññamaññavidhuyoti  na  tadubhayam samudâyavasena  parissamâpayetabbam*,  *tasmâ*  “*yadatthe  namanlakkhanam*,  *tam  nâman.

“*Sabbam  bhikkhave anabhijânam  aparijânam*  (*tattha cittam*) 

*Avirâjayam  appajaham  abhabbo dukkhakkhayâya*. R. 

*Sabbañca kho bhikkave abhijânam  parijânam*  (*tattha citta*) 

*Virâjayam pajayam bhabbo dukkhakkhayâyâ*”*ti.* 

(*Sam.*-2:249 - 250 Parijânana Suttana; *Mahâţî*-2: 358).

*Iti  imassamim   sutte  tissopi  pariññâ  kathitâ  hunti*.   “*Abhijânan*”*ti  hi  vacanena ñâtapariññâ kathitâ*, “*parijânan*”*ti vacanena tîrana pariññâ*, “*virâjayam pajahan*”*ti dvîhi  pahânapariññâti* (*Sam.*- *Ţţha*-3: 6). 

The commentator in the above Visuddhimagga commentary has explained as: *Sabbepi tebhûmake dhamme nâmañca rûpañcâti dvedhâ vavatthapeti =* *tebhûmaka*s, within the three planes of life referred to as all of the *kâma-rûpa-arûpa*, are recognized as *rûpa dhamma*s as well as *nâma dhamma*s (mental factors, material factors) as two  

distinct groups.*  

`           `Here, the word *sabba* = completeness = all is meant to include the entire *dhamma*s of the *sañkhâra* phenomena.  *Nâma* and *rûpa*, however, are taken to be far apart from one another.  (They are not the associated *sampayutta dhamma*s, but are dissociated *vippayutta dhamma*s).  Therefore, the *nâma* and *rûpa dhamma*s should not be analyzed  

together as a composite group,  but be recognized as two distinct groups, and are to be  

taken as given below: 

3. The *dhamma*s that are of the nature of being attracted towards the object are *nâma*, 
3. The *dhamma*s that are subject to change are the *rûpa*. 

Only when so recognized can the non-existence of a certain *dhamma* (such as the living being, soul, *viññân*.*a* , self) of the *tebhûmaka dhamma*s present in the three planes of life and being free from both *nâma* and *rûpa* — the entire *tebhûmaka dhamma*s of the three 

planes of life are recognized as two distinct *nâma* and *rûpa dhammas*.  And this is what the commentator has stressed in his explanation.  

The expression “*Nâmañca rûpañca*” = *nâmadhamma* and *rûpadhamma* is an adequate indication that the *nâma* and *rûpa* are two distinct words, yet they are further expressed as *dvedhâ vavatthapeti* = recognized as two distinct groups.  It was expressed so to vindicate the non-existence  of  a  certain *dhamma*  (such  as  the  living being,  soul, *viññâņa*,  self)  of  the *tebhûmaka dhamma*s present in the three planes of life and being 

free from both *nâma* and *rûpa.*  

It  was  expounded  in  this  way  to  arrive  at  the  determination  that  there  exist  no individual--sentient being-life-self-human-*deva*-*brahmâ* beyond the *nâmarûpa*. 

Again, it was expatiated as ***sabbepi tebhûmake dhamme*** = ***tebhûmakadhamma*** — in the word *sabba*  =  all is used for purpose of concentration on the three general  

characters *anicca*-*dukkha*-*anatta* = so as not to leave any of *sammasanupaggadhamma*. 

Indeed, the *tebhûmakadhamma* in the three planes of existence is the *dhamma* which should entirely be understood analytically; the attachment on to these *tebhûmaka*-*dhamma*s via craving should be eradicated through practice.  By practicing to eradicate the craving on these, one should acquire freedom.  That is the reason why the Buddha has admonished as follows: 

“Bhikkhus .... if the craving for the entire *rûpanâma* phenomena 

7. are not understood penetratively by *ñâtapariññâ paññâ*, 
8. are not known analytically by *tîranpariññâ*, 
8. cannot practice to eradicate and be relieved of the attachment to them by craving, then one is not worthwhile to be relieved of the sorrows of the sansâric circus. 

“Bhikkhus .... in fact, if the entire *rûpanâma* phenomena 

10. are understood penetratively by *ñâtapariññâ paññâ*, 
10. are known analytically by *tîranpariñâ*, 
10. has practiced to eradicate the attachment to them by craving, then one is worthwhile to be relieved of the sorrows of the sansâric circus (*Sam*.-2: 249 -   . 

`     `250). 

This resolution has been made in Mahâtîkâ with reference that of Aparijânanasuttana of  Samyuttapâli Salâyatanavaggasamyutta. 

4. A statement that Nibbâna can be attained by meditating on just a single *rûpa* element, 
4. A  statement  that  Nibbâna  can  be  attained  by  meditating  on  just  a  single  *nâma* element, and 
4. A statement that Nibbâna can be attained by meditating on just a single *rûpa* element and just a single *nâma* element. 

These  three  statements  are  definitely  the  opposite  of  the  resolution  described  in Mahâtîkâ.   He who is in search of the right dhamma, however, should not turn his back on the resolution made in Mahâtîkâ.  In fact he should obediently follow that resolution which has been made with reference the Buddha’s verbally delivered discourse. [The three kinds of *Pariññâpaññâ* have been explained in Bhuddekarata.]

***Dhâtu*** = **element** - *attano sabhâvum  dhâretîti dhâtu* 

It is named *dhâtu* because it possesses its own natural character (*Visuddhi*-2:116). 

The *atta* (self), which is the thought of wrong viewers and whose way of thinking is outside the *sâsanâ*, when investigated by *paramattha* eye of wisdom, does not clearly exist.  Its  non-existence becomes  more  clearly  realized  especially  when  the *rûpa*  and *nâma*  are investigated by way of the eye of wisdom after realization of their ultimate truth.  Nothing other than *rûpa* and *nâma* is realized, nor is there the *atta*, as visualized by *ñâna*.  *Atta* is functionally *karaka* (producer); *atta* can appreciate *vedaka* (feeling).   In this way *atta* has been designated to be *karaka* and *vedaka*, but they are not to be.  It cannot function nor feel.  It is because the *atta* itself, is claimed to have functioning or feeling property, is non-existent.  

The ultimate truth, such as *cakkhu* (eye) etc., are capable of performing and  

existing their own nature.  For instance 

*Rûpâbhighâtârahabhûtappasâdalakkhanam ,* 

*Dalukâmatânidânakammasamutthânabhûtappasâdalakkhanam vâ cakkhu*        (*Visuddhi-*2: 74). 

` `Element of vision (= eye clear element), upon which impinges on the *bhûtarûpa* (mental qualities of sense-fields) = possesses nature of giving clear vision on the Four Great 

Elements.  In other words, it has the nature of giving clear vision of the Four Great 

Elements caused by *kamma* arising from wishing to see the material object which are 

based on *kâmatahnâ*. 

As  indicated  in  Section  on  Rûpakammatthâna,  *rûpa*  phenomena  are  made  up  of subatomic particles called *kalâpas*.  The *kalâpa* is the smallest particle of *rûpa* factors in the sphere of *rûpaparamatta*.  Element of vision too does not exist as individuality but according *rûpakalâ* called *cakkhudasakakalâpa*.  Included in this *cakkhudasaka kalâpa* are 10 *rûpa* phenomena.  These *rûpa dhamma*s are  the *kamma*-produced corporeality  which resulted from  *kamma*  cultivated  in  the  past  based  on  causes  *avijja-tahnâ-upâdâna*.  The  Four Mahâbhûta Elements are also included in these 10 *rûpa*s of the *cakkhudasaka kalâpa*. These Mahâbhûta Elements are the *dhamma*s on which impinges the *rûpa* objects  It is the natural character of element of vision which causes the clearness of the *mahâbhûta* factors; in every element of vision is present this natural character. Therefore, element of vision has its own nature, and performs in its own nature, and existed in the nature of its own.  Note that it also applies to other elements.  Since all these 18 *dhamma*s can exhibit the  phenomena  of the  natural characters  of their own,  they are,  therefore, 

` `nominated as “*dhâtu* = element.” 

Among these 18 elements, the element of vision etc., are by now clearly explained A slight treatment on those still not clear will be made.  First, mind element, *pañcaviññâ*- 

*dhâtu* (the five mind element) element of mental cognition will be described. 

***MANODHÃTU*  (ELEMENT OF APPRECIATION)** *Tîni manodhâtucittâni ekâ manodhâtu*. (*Visuddhi*-2: 224). 

*4.  Pañcadvârâvajjan*;  (2)  *Ahitakusalavipâkasampatcchan*;  (3)  *Ahitaakusala vipâkasampatcchan*, the three kinds of mind are called the *manodhâtu* (element of appreciation). 

*Antâdikâ manodhâtu*, *manoviññânadhâtuyâ*. 

*Pavesâpagane dvâra-pariyâyene titthti* (*Nâmarûpapariccheda*).* 

Among  the  three  *citta*  named  the  *manodhâtu*,  the  *bhavañga*  referred  to  as  the *manoviññâna*  (mind  cognition)  get  dissolved  when  *pañcadvârâvajjâna*  is  attained  and  is thought to have entered into the state of *pañcadvârâvajjâna*.  Therefore, *pañcadvârâvajjâna* is the *dvâra* (door) through which *bhvañgamanoviññâna* enters.  Again, the *manoviññâņa* called  the  *santîrana*  (investigation,  decision)  made  its  appearance  following  the *sampaticchana* (acceptance).  *Sampaticchana*, again, functions  

as  the  outlet  for  *manoviññâņa*.   With  reference  to  instructions  of  this  nature,  the  three*  *manodhâtu* can be taken as the doors for the  *manoviññâņa*.   In other words, it means it  unusual appreciation. 

It is explained in the earlier pages of the section on *Nâmakamma*.*t*.*t* *hâna* etc. that 

4. Element of *bhavañgamano* clearness is the *manodvâra* (mind door), 
4. *Bhavañgamano* together with *âvajjana* (adverting mind) is the *manodvâra*, 
4. From point of view of *T t hânûpacâra* (by way of place) or *phalûpacâra* (by way of contact,  the  *hadayavatthu*  (heart-based  corporeality)  is  called  the  *manodvâra*  too.  (see pages   etc.).  Taking of *bhavañga* as the *manodvâra*, and of *bhavañga*  
\*
`      `together with *âvajjana* as *manodvâra* is the usual way of appreciation. 

In  *pañcadvârâvajjana*  (five  door  contemplation)  and  *sampaticchânadve*  named  as *manodvâra* (mind door), *pañcadvârâvajjana*, when taken as object, is not effective as taking object of concentration following others nor as repetitively taken object of concentration, because the newly formed object in earlier stage of concentration has been taken only once.  That  is  why  the  *manodvâravajjana*  and  *sampaticchanadve*  are  —  *mano   evadhâtu manodhâtu*— referred to as the *manodhâtu* because it is an element which  

could bring about just the consciousness. 

*PAÑCAVIÑÑÂNADHÂTU* 

The *panñviññâna*s have to simply capture the object which directly appear on the receptive  corporeality.   Therefore,  the  force  of  concentration  is  more  than  that  of  the *manodhâtu*, and that is the reason why it is nominated as the *viññânadhâtu*.   It is also named *visesanajâtîti viññânam**  = takes the object more forcefully than the *manodhâtu*.  Because it is supported by *anan tara* force from the *âvajjana* (adverting mind), having different objects, and has to support the *sampaticchana* having different object, it used to  

be  less  forceful  than  the  *manoviññâna*  supporting  the  *viññâna*  of  similar  objects.   As instructed in Vibhañga Pâli referred to as Aññatara Abhinipâtamatta  it is just that falling  upon the respective object of the five-fold object. 

[***Anantara**—***Someone becomes successful at the expense of someone else**.  As this statement goes, two *citta*s (consciousnesses) cannot come about simultaneously, but one after another.  (The earlier consciousnesses disappear after facilitating the appearance of the later).  The  early  *citta*s  arose  and,  after  facilitating  the  rising  of  the  later, perish  away.   Before dissolution of the former, the later *citta*s have no chance to arise.  Remember that an old president would relieve himself only after handing over his duties to the new one.  The support of the former *citta* for the appearance of the next one is called *anantarapaccaya*.] 

THE *MANOVIÑÑÂDHÃTU* 

Literally *mano* (mind) refers to “knowledge”, and so also the *manoviññâna* (mental consciousness) to “special knowledge.”  The combination of the two explicitly gives the essence of a “wide knowledge, a very high knowledge and very high and wide knowledge.”  The way the realization is acquired by the very high and wide knowledge is  

this.  Unlike the *citta*s described above, it does not take the new object at very early state (even though the capture has to be made in a way similar to *manodvâravajjana*), supported by  anantara  force  of  the  citta  having  similar  object,  supports  the  later  citta  of  the  same material object by  force of  *anantara* support.  Hence the capture on  the object is very effective.  Therefore, it is a nominated, from *manoviññânadhâtu* point of view, as  

*mano* with *viññânam* (see Compendium of Buddhist Philosophy, p.182). 

THE 12 *ÃYATANA*S 

Inner Six *Ãyatana*s  Outer Six *Ãyatana*s 

1. *Cakkhâyatana*  (The Eye Base)  1*.  Rûpâyatana* (Visible Object Base) 
1. *Sotâyatana*  (Sense Field of the Ear)  2*.  Saddâyatana* (Sound Base) 
1. *Ghânâyatana* (Nose Base)  3.  *Gandhâyatana*  (Smell/Scent  Object Base) 
1. *Jivhâyatana* (Sense of Tongue)  4.  *Rasâyatana*  (Taste Object Base) 
1. *Kâyâyatana* (Sense Field of the Body)  5.  *Pholabbâyatana* (Tangible Object Base) 
1. *Manâyatana* (Mind Base Sense)  6.  *Dhammâyatana* (Mental Object Base) 
1. The eye clearness element  = the visual sensitivity is called *cakkhâyatana*. 
1. The ear clearness element  = the sound sensitivity is called *sotâyatana*. 
1. The nose clearness sensitivity   = the nasal sensitivity is called *ghânâyatana*.  
1. The tongue clearness sensitivity  = the taste sensitivity is called *jâyatana*. 
1. The tactile clearness sensitivity  = the tangible sensitivity is called *pholabbâyatana*. 
1. The seven *lokî* cognition elements are the *manâyatana*. 

[*Lokiya satta* *viññânadhâtuyo* “*manâyatanan*”*ti.*] (Visuddhi 2:224). 

1. *Rûpârammana* (visible object) is the *rûpâyatana* (visible object base). 

   2. *Saddârammana* (sound object) is the *saddâyatana* (sound base). 
1. *Gandhâramman* (scent object) is the *gandhâyatana* (smell/scent base). 
1. *Rasârammana* (taste object) is the *rasâyatana* (taste base). 
1. *Pholabbârammana* (tactile object) is the *pholabbâyatana* (tangible base) 
1. The 52 *cetasika* (mental concomitants) and 16 *sukhumarûpa* (subtle material forms)      are all *dhammâyatana* (mental base). 

NOMINATION AS *ÃYATANA* 

*Visesato pana âyatanato, âyânam tananato, âyatassa ca **nayanato** **âyatanam**ti Veditabbam* (*Visuddhi*-2: 112). 

It is so named  

1. Because of the functions performed by each and every *citta cetasika* (mind and mental concomitants) on their own. 
1. Because  of  the  capability  of  *âya*  (lengthening)  the  stretched  mind  and  mental concomitants due to exerting effort by each and every one of them. 
1. Because of bearing full suffering of the rounds of rebirth along the *sansâric* circus. 
4. ***Ãyatana***.  It means *âya* (cause) according to the meaning of the terms.  If there is no eye sensitivity and visible object, there can be no *cakkhudvârikavîthicitta* (mind door thought process).  If there are no *cakkhudvârikavîthicitta*, each and every mind and men-tal  concomitant,  appearing  every  *cittakhana*  (thought  moment)  within,  these cannot  per-form  their  respective  functions.  Thus,  the  *cakkhupasâda*  and *rûpârammana*  are  the  causes  for  *cakkhudvâravîthicitta*  and  of  carrying  out  the respective functions by the *cakkhudvârika nâma dhammas* (mental phenomena arising through the eye door).  This is the reason why the name *cakkhâyatana* — *rûpâyatana* is given.  Note that the same applies to the remaining *âyatana* pairs. 
4. Only when there are *cakkhudvâra* (eye door) and *rûpâyamana* (physical object), can there be *nâma dhamma*s (mental factors).  Without these there be no *cakkhu*-*dvâra nâma dhamma*s.  Note that it is also true for *sotadvâra saddârammana* etc.  Each mind and mental concomitant appearing with reference to the corresponding *dvâras* (doors) are stretched by the *âyatana*s.  Like a photographic enlarger which enlarges the small photographs, the *âyatana*s enlarge the mind and mental conco-mitants.  If any one (*ayonisomarikâra* = one having unwise attention) comes across a pleasant sound and agreeable beauty, he would exaggerate on what he has just encountered.  But he comes across a disagreeable sound or a feature, he would exaggerate on what he has seen with a wry face.  He would be smiling within himself and reflecting in his mind of minds. He would be reminiscing on it. This a kind of enlarging the mind mental concomitant.  In the life-continuum of a good man of a *yonisomanasikâra* (= one having wise attention) the *akusala dham-ma*s (unmeritorious deeds) do not get enlarged on the basis of these *dvârâ-rammana*s.  The mind and mental concomitants associated  with  the  insight  know-ledge,  such  as  *aniccanupassanâñana*, *dukkhanupassanâñana*,  *anattaanupassanâ-ñana*  etc.,  however  become  enlarged.  Such a kind of enlargement leads one to the nibbâna, and is worth culturing. 
4. In the infinite rounds of rebirth (*sansâra*), with no beginning, the long suffering of *sansâravatta* (sansâric function) has not yet ceased with non-reappearing cessation, the *anupâdanirodha*.  As long as they remain, these *âyatana*s would be bearing the full-fledged suffering of the sansâric circus.  And hence, they are 

`      `referred to as the *âyatana*s (Visuddhi. 2:112). 

*Manâyatana — Dhammâyatana* Mind based sense — Mental object base 

*Dvârammana bhedena, bhavañtâyatanani ca, dvârammana taduppanna, pariyâyena  dhâtuyo* (*Abhidhammattasañgaha*) 

*Attano sebhâvum  dhâretîti dhammo* = because they their own specific characters, they are named the *dhamma*.  This being so, since all the *paramattha dhamma*s bear their own specific characters (= the characters), they should be taken as a single “*dhammâ-yatana*.”   A question  would  then  arise  as  to  why  it  is  expatiated  as  12  *âyatana*s  but  treating  each separately.  The answer follows. 

This *âyatana desana* is exhorted to clearly differentiate the doors and object of the six kinds of *viññânakâya* (tactile cognition).  Since there are six *dvâra*s and six *âram-* 

*mana* *âyatanas*, it was expounded as 12 *âyatana*s instead of a single *dhammâyatana*. 

7. The door, at which all the *viññâna* (cognition) included in the *cakkhuviññânavîthi* (eye consciousness process), is just the *cakkhâyatana*, and the *rûpârammana* (visible object) is the only object domain. 
8. The door, at which all the *viññâna* (cognition) included in the *sotaviññânavîthi* (ear consciousness process), is just the *sotâyatana*, and *saddârammana* (acoustic object) is the only object domain. 
8. The door, at which all  the *viññâna* (cognition) included in the *ghânaviññânavîthi* (nose consciousness process), is just the *gandhârammana* (olfactory object) is the only object domain. 
8. The  door,  at  which  all  the  *viññâna*  (cognition)  included  in  the  *jivhâviññânavîthi* (tongue consciousness process), is just the *rasârammana* (taste object) is the only object domain. 
8. The door, at which all the *viññâna* (cognition) included in the *kâyaviññânavîthi* (body consciousness process), is just the *phothabbârammana* (tactile object) is the  

`      `only object domain.

*asâdhâranañca dhammâratanam ârammanti* (*Abhi. Ttha.* 2: 43 - 44; *Visuddhi* 2: 113).

12. The door is the plane where all the *viññâna*s* (cognition), which are included in the *manoviññânavîthi*, arise and part of the *âyatana* referred to as *bhavañgacitta*  

`      `arising after being vibrated twice. 

(This is a translation with reference to Mahâtîkâ.  According to speeches made by successive generations of teachers, the plane of formation of all the *viññânas*, included in the *manoviññânavîthi*, is just a part of the *âyatana* referred to as *bhavañgacitta* arising after vibrating twice.  According to the Subcommentary (Tîkâ), the *bhavañgaclana* (vibration of life-continuum),  which  arises  after  vibrating  twice,  is  the  *manodvâra*.   Generations  of teachers  have  said  that  the  vibrating  *bhavañga*  =  vibration  of  life-continuum  =  arising completely later = *bhavañgupaccheda* (cessation of life-continuum)  The only difference is the usage of *bhavañgacalana* and *bhavañgupaccheda*.  In essence, however, note that the main *desanâ* is the same.  The vibrating *bhavañga* = *bhavañga*-*calana* by the power of which the *bhavañga* distinctly arises, and *âvajjana* can only arise when *bhavañga* arises.  *Ãvajjana* will not arise when the *bhavañgacalana* does not arise.  With *bhavañga* as the cause of *âvajjana* in mind, the commentator has explained that *bhavañgacalana* (= *bhavñgupaccheda*) referred to as *bhavañgamana*, which is a part of *âyatana*, is the plane of *dvâra* where all the *viññâna* included in the *manoviññânavîthi* are  

formed.) 

***Ekadesayûpaca** - Lokiyasattaviññânadhâtu manâyatanam* (*Visuddhi* 2: 224). 

It has been explained that all the seven *lokiviññâdhâtu*, i.e., all the *lokîcitta* (the object of  insight  knowledge)  are  *manâyatana*.   Note  that  *bhavañga*  *citta*,  which  is  a  part  of *manâyatana*, is taken by way of *ekadesayñpacâya* as *manâyatana*, and again this  *bhavañgamanâyatana* as the *manodvâra* the support of all *manoviññâna*. 

***Dhammâyatana —** Tasampayuttâ phassâdayo sesarûpañca* “*dhammâyatanan*”*ti* (*Visud*- *dhi* 2: 224). 

All *âyatana*s, except the *lokîviññânadhâtu* and *phassa* etc. of 25 mind and mental concomitants  occurring  in  each  *cittakhana*  and  *cakkhâyatana*  etc.  of  the  above  10 *rûpâ*- *yatana*, the remaining 16 *sukhumarûpa*s are the *dhammâyatana*s.  These *dhammâyatana*s  

are not associated either as *dvâra* or object with *cakkhuviññâna* etc. of the *pañcaviññâna*. 

Another way of taking *Manodvâra*.  “*Ayam nâma mano manâdvâram na hotî*”*ti (Abhi.  Tha.* 1: 129). 

According to this commentary, the early *mana* (= mind) is beneficial to the later *mana* (mind).  Therefore, all the early *mana* can be taken as the causative *dvâra* of the later ones.  With reference to this commentary all the *citta* called *manâyatana* are *mano*-*dvâra*.  Taking only the *bhavañga* as the *manodvâra* is routine way.  Note that all the *citta* as *manodvâra* is by way of *pariyâya*. (A kind of *pariyâya* refers to the *anantara*, the  

proximate cause). 

***Dhammâyatana  also  is  a  pariyâya***.   *Rûpâyatana*  etc.  are  usually  (customarily) referred  to  as  *rûpâyatana*.   *Dhammâyatana*  and  *dhammâramana*,  however,  are  slightly different.  As mentioned under *Dhammâyatana* (see earlier pages of this vol.),  *pasâda-rûpa* (clear  sensitivity),  *sukhumarûpa*  (subtle  forms),  mind,  mental  concomitant,  nibbâna  and *paññatti* (concept) are included in the phenomena called *dhammârammana*.  Exhorta- tion has been made to selectively include the object of insight knowledge in the *dhammâ*-*yatana*.  But nibbâna and *paññatti* cannot be included.  The five clear sensitivity, which have been specially  designated  as  *cakkhâyatana*  etc.,  cannot  be  included  in  the  *dhammâ*-*yatana.*  Because all the *lokicitta*s have been given a special name *manâyatana*, they are not included in  the  *dhammâyatana*.   Therefore,  it  must  be  noted  that  designating  *dham*-*mâyatana*  as *dhammârammana* — the six *dvârayatana*, the six *ârammanâyatana* — differentiating 12 *âyatana*s is because of a kind of *pariyâya* (conditioned cause). (The *âyatana desanâ* was expounded for *rûpasammûlâ* and *majjimarûci* individuals.  See  

section on *Rûpakammatthâna*). 

[**Special Note**.  Among the 16 subtle forms named *dhammâyata* is also included the very  important  *hadayavatthurûpa*  (heart-based  corporeality,  which  also  is  the  *dham*- *mâyatana*.  This is a factor very important in concentrating on the 12 *âyatana* objects and  

the 18 element objects.] 

Again, the six doors, the six objects and the six concepts, developed dependent upon the six objects of concentration, together come to 18 in all — the six each of the doors, the objects and the concepts.  It should be noted that, as described in  

*dhammâyatana*, the *dhammadhâtu* is called *dhammârammana*. 

CULTURING *RÛPA* — *NÂMA* BY WAY OF 18 ELEMENTS 

In section on *Rûpakammatthâna*, the *cakkhudvâra* = 54 kinds of visual sense (the  eye), the true *rûpa*s have been described in tables.  Among these 54 

1) 1.  Clear sensitivity is the visual element, but the remaining 53 are not. 
5. *Rûpârammana* (visible object base) is the *rûpa* element. 
5. Depending on the *cakkhudhâtu*, and taking the *rûpadhâtu* as the object, there 

arises the mind which is the *cakkhuvññânadhâtu*. 

2) 1.   *Sotapasâda*  (clear  sensitivity  of  ear)  is  the  *sotadhâtu*  (sound  element),  but  the   remaining 53 are not. 
2. *Saddârammana* is the *saddâdhâtu* 
3. The *citta* (mind) which arises depending on and taking *saddahâtu* as the object, is  the *sotaviññânadhâtu*. 
3) 1.  *Ghânâpasâda* (nose clear sensitivity) is the *gânadhâtu* (the scent element), but the remaining 53 are not. 
2. *Gandârammana* is the *gandadhâtu*. 
2. The  *citta*  (mind)  which  arises  depending  on  *ghânadhâtu*  and  taking  the *gandârammana* as the object, is  the *ghânaviññânadhâtu*. 
4) 1.  *Jivhâpasâda* (tongue clear sensitivity) is the *jivâdhâtu* (the scent element), but the remaining 53 are not. 
2. *Rasârammana* (*taste object)* is the *rasadhâtu*. 
2. The *citta* (mind) which arises depending on *jivhâdhâtu* and taking *jivhârammana*  as the object, is  the *jivhâviññânadhâtu*. 
5) 1.  *Kâyapasâda* (clear sensitivity of body) is the *kâyadhâtu* (the body element), but the remaining 53 are not. 
2. *Pholabbârammana* (*tactile object)* is the *pholabbadhâtu* (tangible element). 
2. The *citta* (mind) which arises depending on *kâyadhâtu* and taking *pholabba*  as the object, is  the *kâyaviññânadhâtu.* 
6) 1.  *Pañcadvâvajjana* - *sampatichannadve* is the *manodhâtu*.  
2. The 52 *cetasika* (mental concomitants) and 16 *sukhumarûpa* (subtle material forms) are the *dhammadhâtu*. 
2. The *citta* (mind) which arises depending *manodhâtu* and taking *dhammadhâtu*  as  

`           `the object, is  the *manoviññânadhâtu*. 

[Note.  As a good man the *manoviññânadhâtu*, which can acquired at a *tihita* (3-rooted condition) worldling stage, in your life-continuum are of the following kinds: 

1. *Akusalacitta* (karmically unwholesome consciousness)   12 
1. *Santîranacitta* (investigating consciousness)   3 
1. *Manodvâravajjana*   (advertence)     1 
1. *Mahâkusalacitta* (great, wholesome consciousness)   8 
1. *Mahâvipâkacitta* (result of great deed)               8 
1. *Rûpâvacarajana* (*kusala*) (fine material sphere consciousness)   4 (*catukka* method) They all come to a total of 36 kinds. 

If raised to *rûpâvacara* (world of forms) by way of *pañcaka* (five-fold), there will be 37 kinds of *viññânadhatu* (consciousness element).  If all the eight *samâpatti* (sus- 

tained deep mental absorption) have been acquired, there will be 40 or 41 *viññânadhâtu*.] 

In this way the various  *dhâtu*  (elements)  are discerned to attain the visual  knowledge of their ultimate truth: 

7. *Cakkhudhâtu, rûpadhâtu, cakkhuviññânadhâtu ,* 
7. *Sotadhâtu, saddadhâtu, sotaviññânadhâtu,*  
7. *Ghânadhâtu, gandhadhâtu, ghânaviññânadhâtu ,* 
7. *Jivhâdhâtu, rasadhâtu, jivhâviññânadhâtu,*  
7. *Kâyadhâtu, pholabbadhâtu, kâyaviññânadhâtu,*  
7. *Manodhâtu, dhammadhâtu, manoviññânadhâtu*.  (Note that it is not citation        *kammatthâna*). 

DISCERN THE *RÛPA* - *NÂMA* 

When  you  are  able  to  concentrate  on  and  take  up  the  rûpa  and  nâma  by  your 

knowledge as 

3. *Cakkhudhâtu,  rûpadhâtu,  sotadhâtu,  saddâdhâtu,  ghânadhâtu,  gandhadhâtu, jivhâdhâtu,* the 16 *sukhumarûpa* (a part of *dhammadhâtu*), called the *dhammadhâtu*, are the *rûpadhamma*s.  
3. *Cakkhuviññânadhâtu, sotaviññânadhâtu* -------------- *manoviññânadhâtu,* the (52) mind and mental concomitants, called the *dhammadhâtu*s, are the *nâma-* 

`         `*dhamma*. 

In this way take up and discern the *rûpa* and *nâma dhamma*s (*Visuddhi* 2: 224). 

DISCERNING *RÛPA - NÂMA* BY WAY OF 12 *ÃYATANA*S 

`  `A   1.  *Cakkhupasâda* is the *cakhâyatana*.  

\2.  *Rûpârammana* is the *rûpâyatana.* 

`  `B   1.  *Sotapasâda* is the *sotâyatana*. 

\2.  *Saddârammana* is the *saddâyatana*. 

C.  1.  *Ghanapasâda* is the *ghânâyatana*. 

\2.  *Gadhâyatana* is the *gandhâyatana*. 

4. 1.  *Jivhârammmana* is the *jivhâyatana*. 

\2.  *Rasârammana* is the *rasâyatana*. 

5. 1.  *Kâyapasâda* is the *kâyâyatana*. 

\2.  *Pholabbâyatana* is the *pholabbâyatana*. 

6. 1.  The seven *lokâviññâdhâtu* is the *manâyatana*. 

\2.  the 52 mind and mental concomitants, the *dhammârammana* called the 16 subtle   

`            `material forms are  the *dhammâyatana*. 

The  *cakkhâyatana-rñpâyatana,*  the  *sotâyatana-saddâyatana,*  the  *ghânâyatana- gandhâyatana,*  the  *jivhâyatana-rasâyatana,*  the  *kâyâyatana-pholabbâyatana,*  the *dhammâyatana*, called the* 16 subtle material forms, are all ***rûpadhamma***. 

The *manâyatana* and *dhammâyatan* (called the 52 *cetasika*) are all ***nâmadham-*** 

***ma***. 

In this way concentrate on the *rûpa-nâma* and discern the *rûpa-nâma* (*Visuddhi* 2: 224 - 225). 

Here too it is important that the *kammatthâna* is not a citation.  One has to understand that the instruction is made to concentrate on these *âyatana*s as object to attain the ultimate truth via perfect knowledge (insight knowledge).  The method is to combine the 18 *dhâtu*s and the 12 *âyatana*s and to discern on the sum total of these.  The discernment analytically of these into finer details is given in Mûlapannasa Commentary as follows.  They are the ways of discerning the four *âyatana*s and the four *dhâtu*s that arise at every *vîthicittakhana* (mental process moment) along the course of *cittaniyâma* (mental certainty). 

**A WAY OF DISCERNING *DHÂTU* — *ÂYATANA*** 

*Tatthâ cakkhu cakkhâyatanam, rûpam rûpâyatanam, dassanam manâyatana vedanâdayo sampayuttadhammâ dhammâyatanam.  Evametesam catunnam âyatanânam samavâye âlokanavilokanam paññâyati.  Tattha ko eko âloketi, ko viloketi.  Tathâ cakkhu cakkhu-dhâtu, rûpam rûpadhâtu, dassanam cakkhuviññânadhâtu, tamsampayuttâ vedanâdayo dhammadhâtu.  Evametâsam cakkhunnam dhâtunam samavâye âlokanavikkanam*  

*paññâyati.  Tatthako eko âloketi, ko viloketi* (*Ma-Ttha.* 1: 268). 

If the following four  *âyatana*s  happen to come together there occurs the state of  looking straight and looking askance. 

5. Eye clear element is the eye base* 
5. Visible object is the visible object base 
5. Visualizing visual concept is the mind base 
5. The associated mind and mental concomitant *sampayutta dhamma* groups, such as *phassa-vedanâ-saññâ-cetanâ-ekaggatâ-jîvita-manasikâra*,  are  the  *dhammâ-yatana* (mental object base). 

Now who would see this way?  Which living being would look straight forward or askance?  (It means there is neither straight forward looking nor looking askance ones).   

A similarly situation holds true for the following. 

5. *Cakkhupasâda* (the eye sensitivity) is the *cakkhudhâtu* (the element of vision) 
5. *Rûpârammana* (the visible object base)* is the *rûpadhâtu* (the mental element)*.* 
5. Realizing *cakkhuviññâna* (the eye consciousness) is the *cakkhuviññânadhâtu* (the eye consciousness element). 
5. The  associated  mental  concomitants,  such  as  *phassa*  etc.,  the  *phassasampayutta*- *dhamma* (associated tangible factors) are *dhammadhâtu* (mind element). 

(*Ma.Ttha*.1: 261). 

The  opening  of  these  documentaries  explained  in  such  a  way  that  the  manifestations become vividly materialized using the *upalakkhanâ* and *nidassana* methods. 

Now you good man, discern the *nâmakammatthâna* tables again.  Pay attention to them as the object of concentration.  Pay attention on the corporeality and mentality once again.  In the above commentary it is explained that the four *âyatana*s and the four *dhâtu*s are realized as the  *rûpârammana*  at the instance of the  *cittaviññâna*  (mental consciousness) *cittakkhana* (thought moment). 

The  mental  consciousness cannot  arise  without *pañcadvâravajjana*  (apprehension through the five sense doors) arising before it.  If it is the *cakkhuviññâna* (eye consciousness), a  series  of  thought  processes  do  not  halt  during  the  interval  of  *cakkhuviññâna*,  or  of *sampaticchana*,  nor  *santîrana*.   It  will  continue  at  least  up  to  *vuttho*  (determining consciousness).  Even then, the *ârammana* has to be weak *parittârammana* for it to halt the mental  processes  and  come  to  a  *bhavañga*  (rapt.).   If  the  *ârammana*  (the  object)  is  the *mahantarâramma*, it is usual to continue up to the attainment of *jo* (impulsion), if *atirâm mana* up to *tadârammana* (registering). 

Therefore at a consciousness moment of *cakkhuviññâna*, the four *âyatana*s and the four *dhâtu*s are formed, so also at the *pañcadvâravajjana, sampticchana, santîrana*, *uttho, tadârammana* etc., there are four *âyatana*s and four *dhâtu*s respectively.  A few examples will be cited here.  At each thought moment, there will be four  *âyatana*s  and  

four *dhâtu*s respectively, where — 

5. Supporting heart-based corporeality is the *dhammâyatana* (mental object). 
5. *Rûpârammana* (visible object) is the *rûpâyatana* (visible object base). 
5. *Pañcadvârâvajjana  citta*  (conscious  mind  through  the  five  sense  doors)  is  the *manâyatana* (mind-based sense). 
5. The associated mental concomitant *sampayutta* (association) groups are *dhammâ*- *yatana* (mental base). 
5. The supporting heart-based corporeality is the *dhammadhâtu.* 
5. The visible object is the *dhammadhâtu*. 
5. The *pañcadvârâvajjana citta* is the *manodhâma*. 
8. The associated mental concomitant *sampayutta* groups are *dhammadhâtu*. 

`           `However, the heart-based corporeality and associated  mental  concomitant *dhamma* groups are both the  *dhammadhâtu*.  If such similar *dhamma*s are combined, there will be three *âyatana*s and three *dhâtu*s.  Note that this hold true for the remaining thought processes  (*vîthicitta*).  Whether small or large in numbers,  all the associated mental  

concomitant *sampayutta dhamma*s are the *dhammâyatana* and *dhammadhâtu* only. 

There still remain some distinct cases.  For example, though *sampaticchana* is named *manâyatana* (the mental object base), but as an element it is *manodhâtu* (the mental element).  It is not nominated as *manoviññânadhâtu*.  Note that the remaining thought processes are *manoâyatana* as well as *manoviññânadhâtu*.  For those still with immature knowledge the *jocittakhana* (moment of consciousness impulsion) , which includes *nâmadhamma*, is given as an illustration. 

In each and every *jocittakhanâ* (character of consciousness impulsion), under- 

stand the four *âyatana* 

5. The supporting heart-base corporeality is the *dhammâyatana* (= *dhammadhâtu*). 
5. The *rûpârammana* is the *rûpâyatana*. 
5. The *kusalajoviññâna* (meritorious consciousness impulsion) is the *manâyatana*  (= *manoviññânadhâtu*). 
8. The associated mental concomitant, the (33) association *dhamma* groups are the  

`      `*dhammâyatana* (= *dhammadhâtu*). 

In other words, if the heart-base corporeality and mental concomitant *dhamma* are combined as they have similar âtatana, there will be  three *âyatana*s and three *dhâtu*s.  In this way concentrate on the four *âyatana*s and the four *dhâtu*s at every thought process moment.  Discern on all the good and bad groups in accordance with process series.  Contemplate covering all the six lines.  Concentrate on row after row given in the *Ñâmakammattha* tables.  When one is able to also discern *patisandhe-bhavañga-cuti*,  

continue in a similar way as above. 

If  one  wants  to  discern  another  way,  after  successfully  concentrating  on  the  four *âyatan*s and the four *dhatu*s at every thought moment as mentioned above, one may culture the whole row through and through.  Lest use see the first row (good group table) of line showing the *rûpârammana* of the good group table.  Here, there are *pañcadvârâvajjana, cakkhuviññâna, sampticchana, santîrana, vuttho*, seven impulsions, two   *tadârammana* — *manodvârâvajjana*,  seven impulsions, two  *tadârâmmana*  

respectively.  The at every thought process moment, discern as given below. 

5. The  supporting  heart  base  corporeality  as  object  concentrate  as  *dhammâyatana*, *cakkhâyatana, dhammâyatana, dhammâyatana* ..... 
6. Taking rûpârammana as object concentrate as *rûpâyatana, rûpâyatana,* ..... 
7. Taking each consciousne mind as object collect as *manâyatana*, *manâyatana*. 
7. Taking the associated mental concomitant *sampayutta dhamma* groups as object,  

`       `concentrate as *dhammâyatana*, *dhammâyatana*. 

In this way collect each row four times. 

In supporting corporeality, all the *cakkhuviññâna dhamma* groups are  upon  *cak*- *khuvutthurûpa* (visual corporeality).  All the remaining thought processes arise dependent upon the heart base corporeality called the *dhammâyatana* and *dhamma-dhâtu*.  So note that in the supporting corporeality, the *dhammâyatana*s are for the remaining thought processes, and the *cakkâyatana* is for the *cakkhuviññâna*.   In con- 

tinuation, a hint on collection by the 18 *dhâtu* way will be described. 

5. Taking  the  supporting  corporeality  as  the  only  object  discern  as  *dhammadhâtu, dhammadhâtu, dhammadhâtu, dhammadhâtu* .... 
6. The *ârâmmanarûpa* only is taken as the object and discern as *rûpadhâtu, rûpa-dhâru* .... 
7. Taking  each  conscious  mind  as  the  object  discern  as  *manodhâtu,  cakkhuviññâna- dhâtu, manodhâtu, manoviññânadhâtu*. 
8. The associated mental concomitant *sampayutta dhamma* groups are taken as the  

`       `object and discerned as *dhammadhâtu, dhammadhâtu* ..... 

The  above  1  -  4 belong  to  the  eye  door  thought process  and  mind  door  thought 

process. 

The *pañcadvârâvajjana* and *samptaticchana*  are the *manodhâtu, cakkhuviññâna* is the *cakkhuviññâna dhâtu*, and the remaining thought processes are the *cakkhuviññâna dhâtu*.  In  contemplating  on  the  *cetasika*,  each  is  taken  with  reference  to  its  associated  *cetasika* arising at each thought moment, and collectively taken as the *dhammâyatana* or  

the *dhammadhâtu*. 

Collect all the bad and good groups in each row in the line showing *rûpârammana*.  Discern in the *saddârammana*, etc. in a similar way.  In this method the discernment on  

both *âyatana* and *dhâtu* phenomena are the same. 

Reside singly in *arañña* (in the forest), *rukkhâmûla* (under a tree), *suññâgâra* (in a quiet place) happily, as the Lord has instructed.  With the mind set at the nibbâna with *appamâdadhamma*  (mindfulness) called the vigilance on the object  *rûpanâmadhamma  sañkhâra*, a vigorous concentration is to be made with unyielding zest and zeal. 

Now  collection  of  the  five-fold  corporeality  will  be  described.   To  begin  with, *khandhâ* (corporeality) and *upâdânakkhandhâ* (the five clinging aggregate) will be presented. **EXTRACTS FROM KHANDHÂ-SUTTANA**

Bhikkhus .... I shall now admonish to you as regard five-fold corporeality and  the  five-fold clinging aggregate.  Now you all listen. 

Bhikkhus .... What are the five-fold corporeality?  Bhikkhus .... There are such *dhamma*s as 

7. The *rûpa* dhamma (corporeality phenomena) of the past, future and present, all those that are internal and external, all those that are coarse and subtle, all those that are low and lofty, all those that are far (from the consciousness of the meditator) and near (close to the consciousness of the meditator).  All these (11) categories of material forms are the *rûpakkhandhâ* (the aggregate of the matter or of corporeality). 
7. R.   All  the  *vedanâ  dhamma*  (phenomena  of  suffering)  are  the  *vedanakkhandhâ* (aggregate of sensation or feeling group). 
7. R.  All the *saññâ dhamma* (phenomena of perception) are the *saññakkhandhâ* (the aggregate of mental formation or perception group). 
7. R.  all the *cetasika sankhâra dhamma* (mental formation phenomena) are *sankhâ- ranakkhandhâ* (aggregate of mental formation). 
7. All the *viññâna dhamma* (consciousness factor) of the past, future and present, all those that are internal and external, all those that are coarse and subtle, all those that are low and lofty, all those that are far and near.  All these (11) categories of   

`      `are the *viññâna dhamma*. are *viññânakkhandhâ*  (the aggregate of consciousness).   

Bhikkhus .... These are the five-fold *khandhâ*s 

(*Sam*. 2: 39; *Khandhâsuttana*). 

Bhikkhus .... What are the five-fold *upâdânakkhandhâ*? There are such *dhamma*s as 

12. 1.  All the *rûpa* phenomena of the past, future and the present, to which are attached as “I, mine” by *tahnâ, ditthi* and which are the object of the four *âsava dhamma* (moral intoxicants), all those that are internal and external, all those that are coarse and subtle, all those that are low and lofty, all those that are far (from consciousness) and near (to consciousness).  All these physical phenomena  are  

`      `the *rûpupâdânakkhandhâ*  (the aggregate as the object of grasping), existing as     (11)  

categories, and attached as “I, mine” by means of *tahnâ, ditthi,* the object of  

`      `the four immoral intoxicants. 

6. R.  All the *vedanâ dhamma* are the *vedanupâdânakkhandhâ* (clinging to the aggregate of sensation). 
6. R.  All the *saññâ dhamma* are the *saññupâdânakkhandhâ* (clinging to the aggregate of perception). 
6. R.  All the *cetasika sañkhâra* dhammas are the *sankârupâdânakkhandhâ* (clinging to the aggregate of formation). 
6. R.  All the *viññâna dhamma* (concept phenomena) are the *viññânupâdânakkhandhâ*  

`      `(clinging to the aggregate of sensation) (*Sam*.-2:39, *Khandha-suttana*) 

***KHANDHÂ* AND *UPÂDÂNAKKHANDHÂ***  

**(THE AGGREGATES AND THE AGGREGATES AS OBJECT OF**  

**CLINGING)** 

*Chatthe rûpakkhandho kâmâvacaro, cattâro khandhâ catubhûmakâ.*  R.  *Idhâpi rûpak- khandho kâmâvacaro, avasesâ tebhûmakâ vipassanâcâravasena vuttâ.  Evmettha rûpam râsatthena khandhesu pavittham, sasavrâsatthena upâdânakkhandhesu*.  *Vedanâdayo*

3. In the five-fold *khandhâ*, *rûpakkhandhâ* is the *kâmâvacara* (the realms of sensual pleasures).  The *vedanâ-saññâ-sankhâra-viññâna*, called the four-fold *nâmakkhandhâ* (the mental aggregate) are the *kâma-rûpa-arûpa-lokuttarâ* (the sensual existence-deva corporeal-formless  existence),  the  *dhamma*s  of  the  four  *bhavana*  (planes)  of existence.  The first *Khandhâdesanâ* was expounded to show that, whether in the mundane  or  supra-mundane,  all  the  *dhamma*s  that  can  be  taken  collectively  as aggregates   
3. In the *upâdânakkhandhâ,* expounded as the second *desanâ*, corporeal aggregate is the *kâmâvacara dhamma*.  *Vedanâ-saññâ-sankâra-viññâna*, the four *nâmak-khandhâ*, are those *tebhûmaka dhamma*s formed in the three planes of existence as *kâma-rûpa- arûpa*.   The  Buddha  has  to  again  expatiate  the  *upâdânakkhandhâ*  (the  clinging aggregate) as the object of *vipassanañâna* (insight knowledge)  

`       `referred to as the *vipassanacâra* (vipassanâ exercise). 

For a meditator still at the three-root plane of mundane mind and mental concomitant, called  the  *lokuttarakhandhâ*  are  the  *dhamma*  he  has  not  acquired  yet.   Therefore  the *vipassanâbhâvanâ kammatthâna*, taking the lokuttarakhandhâas the object, cannot be made by analytical knowledge.  But those who have acquired the *lokuttara* *dhamma* can.  The  *lokuttara*  mind and mental concomitant, however, the  *sañkhata*  

(results produced by specific action) *dhamma* too.  With reference to — 

*Tînimâni bhikhave sañkhatassa sañkhatalakkhanâni.  Katamâ tîni, uppâdo paññâyatti,  vayopañâyati, tthitassa aññatthattam paññâyati* (*Am.* 1: 150). 

the  *sañkhata  suttana  desanâ*,  formation-static-dissolution  =  *upâdâ-tthî-bhañga*,  there  are definitely three *sañkhata* (results produced by specific action) characters.  Because of these three, they  are also the *sañkhata* *dhamma*s.  They are the *dhamma*s dependent upon the phenomena of *anicca*, *dukkha* and *anatta* of the *sañkhata* *dhamma* — arising only when supported  by  the  forceful  object  of  *upanissaya*  property  of  insight  knowledge  called *dhammaditthi*.   Also  when  supported  by  the  force  of  *ârammana  paccaya*  (the  object condition)  of  *asañkhata  dhâtu*  (the  unconditioned  and  absolute  element)  only  can  these *dhamma*s arise.  They are the *sañkhâra dhamma*s too.  Therefore, it is true that they are  

the *anicca, dukkha* and *anatta dhamma*s. 

Although  these  *lokuttarâ  citta-cetasika*  (the  supra-mundane  mind  and  mental concomitants) are the *sañkata* and *sañkhâra dhamma*s included in the *anicca-dukkha-anatta dhamma* groups, the *magga dhamma*s (the Path factors) are those that relieve one  from the suffering of the rounds of rebirth = the good *niyânika* (leading to salvation) *dhamma*s.  The *phala*  (Fruit)  *dhamma*s  are  also  the  good  causes  definitely  leading  to  enjoyment  of  the *santisukha* of the *nibbâna* = the great peacefulness.  Therefore the discernment on these *lokuttarâ citta* and *cetasika* by *vipassanâ* as *anicca-dukkha-anatta* are not meant to become wearied of worldly life by *nibbinda ñâna* (knowledge of tedium) But when the vipassanâ exercise  is  made  taking  as  object  only  on  the  *lokî  citta-cetasika*-*rûpa*,  recognized  as  the causes for suffering of the *sansâr*ic circus, then the nature of *citta-cetasika* will vividly be understood.   Then  the  *nibbinda  ñâna*,  which  become  entirely  tedious  of  the  five-fold *upâdânakkhandhâ*, referred to as the suffering of the *sansâr*ic circus, will arise.  That is why only  the  *lokî  khandhâ*s  (mundane  aggrgate)  taken  as  object  in   exercising *vipassanâkammatthâna*.  With a view to contemplate in this way,  

the Buddha has to admonish *upâdânakkhandhâ desanâ* solely of the *lokî khandhâ*s. 

Since the *rûpa dhamma* means aggregate, it is also included in the *khandhâ*s.  It also bears the meaning of aggregate as the object of  *âsava*  (canker, fetter)  *dhamma*s,  

hence it is included in the *upâdânakkhandhâ*s too. 

The four-fold *nâma khandhâ*s, such as *vedanâ* (feeling) etc., are the *khandhâ*s that are the object of the *âsava dhamma*s.  There are those *khandhâ*s which are not the object of the *âsava dhamma*s.   The  *lokî citta-cetasika*  included in this four-fold  *khandhâ*s  are  

the object of *âsava dhamma*s, but *lokuttarâ citta-cetasika* are not. 

Included  in  the  three  planes  of  life,  *kâma-rûpa-arûpa*,  are  the  *lokî  citta-cetasika- vedanâ-saññâ-sañkhâra-viññâna*.  These are included in *upâdânakkhandhâ* because it bears the meaning of being the object of *âsava dhammas*. 

The of the *lokî citta-cetasika-rûpa*  included in the three planes of life — 

5. The 28 species of *rûpa* are *rûpupâdânakkhandhâ*. 
5. *Vedanâcetasika* is the *vedanupâdânakkhandhâ*. 
5. *Saññâcetasika* is the *saññûpânakkhandhâ*. 
5. The remaining (50) *cetasika*s are all *vedanupâdhânakkhandhâ*. 

[N.B.  To make it easier, the five-fold upâdânakkhandhâ are sometimes expressed as the *rûpakkhandhâ,  vedanâ-kkhandhâ,  saññâ-kkhandhâ,  sañkhârakkhandhâ*  and  *viññânak- khandhâ*,  or  *rûpa*-*vedanâ-saññâ,  sañkhâra-viññâna*  respectively.  When  you  come  acroos such  usage,  note  that  they  all  refer  to  the  *upâdânakkhandhâ*s,  the  object  of  vipassanâ meditation.  In the *viññânakkhandhâ* is mentioned *lokîcitta*.  These *lokîcitta*s, however, refer only to those that can arise in one’s *santâna*s (life continuum).  Note also that the cetasika refers to those associated with the corresponding *citta*s.]  

DISCERN *NÂMA-RÛPA* SEPARATELY 

*Iti rûpakkhandho rûpam, cattâro arûpno khandhâ nâmanti evameko  pañcakkhandhavasena nâmarûpam vavatthapeti* (*Visuddhi* 2: 225). 

Discern *rûpa* and *nâma* separately as “*rûpadhamma* and *nâmadhamma* as follows 

3. *Rûpakkhandhâ* is the *rûpadhamma*. 
3. The four-fold *nâma khandhâ* is the *nâmadhamma* 

This is the way the *rûpa-nâma* are discerned by method of the five-fold *khandhâ*s.  This is the way all the *rûpadhamma*s and *lokî nâma khandhâ*s are collectively concentrated upon. 

4. *Arûpasammûlhâ* = he who lacks clear consciousness on the *nâmadhamma*.* 
4. *Samkhittaruci* =  he who enjoys any thing concise. 
4. *Tikkhapaññâvâ* = intelligent and sharp-minded person 

With reference to the above three kinds of person, the Buddha has to expound the  vipassanâ meditation by method of *khandhâ desanâ*. 

Discerning  collectively  in  this  way  can  be  accomplished  only  by  sharp-minded person.  The following meditation method is given for slow-minded persons. 

DISCERNING IN DETAIL — THE FIVE-FOLD *KHANDHÂ* METHOD 

*Ittha hi cakkhu ceva rûpañca rûpakkhandho, dassanam viññânâ-kkhandho, tam-sampayuuta vedanâ vedanâ-kkhandho, saññâ saññâ-kkhandho, phassâdikâ sañkhârakkhando*.  *Evametesam pañcannam khandhânam sammavâye âlokanavilokanam*  

*paññâyati*.  *Tattha ko eko âloketi, ko viloketi* (*Ma.-Ttha.-*1: 267 - 268). 

In the *pañcadvâravîthi* (the five-door consciousness process) at a thought moment of consciousness by way of sight, the straight visualization and visualization at a glance vividly appear when the five-fold corporeality are captured together as 

6. The eye clear element and *rûpârammana* are the *rûpakkhanda* (aggregate of matter), 
6. The  consciousness  by  way  of  sight,  having  visual  capability,  is  the  aggregate  of consciousness, 
6. The  *vedanâ*  (suffering)  associated  with  the  aggregate  of  consciousness  is  the aggregate of sensation or feeling group., 
6. The perception is the aggregate of perception, 
6. The contact etc., of the five-fold mind and mental concomitant are the aggregate  

`      `of mental formation. 

`     `Now which individual would have straight visualization and which one has 

glancing ability? (What it means is that there is neither any individual of straight visualization nor glancing, it is only the phenomenon of the five-fold aggregate coming  

together.) 

As explained in many places above, the consciousness by way of sight cannot arise without  the  *pañcadvâravajjana*  (apprehension  through  the  five  sense  doors),  nor *sampaticchana, santirana, vuttho*, nor impulsion if it is *mahantârammana*, nor the impulsion- *tadârammana* (the then object) if it is *atimahntârammana*.  Because of this, the five-fold aggregate as the object of concentration, at the thought moment of consciousness by way of sight, has been  indicated by the Commentator.  Note that it is described as an instruction made via *upalakkhana* (way of distinguishing) and *nidassana* (compartive way).  Therefore, the five-fold aggregate is taken as the object of meditation on consciousness by way of sight, so also is it in the following. 

7. The five-fold aggregate in *pañcadvârâvajjana*, 
7. The five-fold aggregate in *sampaticchana*, 
7. The five-fold aggregate in *santîrana*, 
7. The five-fold aggregate in *vuttho,* 
7. The five-fold aggregate in *javana* (impulsion), 
7. The five-fold aggregate in *tadârammana*, 

Again in *manodvâravîthi* (in *manodvâravîthi*s that follows) 

4. The five-fold aggregate in *manodvârawajjana*, 
4. The five-fold aggregate in each *javana*, 
4. The five-fold aggregate in each *tadârammana*s, 

` `Note that it is the same in cases of *sotadvâravîthi* etc. 

A GOOD DISCIPLINE 

In meditation on *rûpa-nâma* by way of the five-fold *khandhâ*,  practice along the rows have been found to have a clearer consciousness.  Refer back to the good groups along the *rûpârammana*  rows  in  the  table  of  *Kammatthâna*.  Take  *cakkhu-dvâravîthi*  and *manodvâravîthi*  (eye-door thought process and mind-door thought process),  influenced by *mahâkusala*  (great moral)  impulsion, which occupy the first row of the table as an example.  The concentration is made described below. 

6. The 54 species of corporeality as object together with *rûpârammana* of each and every *cittakhana* (thought moment) in the *cakkhudvâravîthi* and *manodvâravîthi* are understood by wisdom as ***rûpa***, ***rûpa*** …….. 
6. Every  *vedanâ*  (suffering)  associated  with  each  *cittakhana*  are  taken  as  object  and understood by wisdom as ***vedanâ**, **vedanâ*** …. 
6. Every *saññâ* (perception) associated with each *cittakhana* are taken as  object and understood by wisdom as ***saññâ*,** ***saññâ*** …. 
6. All *cetasika*s (mental concomitants), other than *vedanâ-saññâ*, are taken together as object and understood by wisdom as ***sañkhâra*,** ***sañkhâra*** …. 
6. Every  *citta*  (consciousness)  associated  with  each  *cittakhana*  are  taken  as  object       and understood by wisdom as ***viññâna*,** ***viññâna*** …. 

The good and bad groups in *rûpârammana* are meditated in similar ways.  Note that the same applies to those along the *saddârammana* (sound base). 

WHAT TO CONCENTRATE UPON WHEN UNDERSTOOD 

If you have successfully practiced up to stage mentioned above, you should be  

able to answer the question.  If not, the answer follows. 

At  every  thought  moment  of  *manodvâravîthi*,  that*  continue  taking  as  object *cakkhudvâravîthi rûpârammana* that appears while discerning on the *rûpârammana*, the  ultimate truth and *dhâtu* essence of the *rûpa-nâma* should be understood by  wisdom as follows. 

4. **Four each of *âyatana*** according to *âyatana desanâ* ways. 
4. **Four each of *dhâtu*** according to *dhâtu desanâ* ways. 
4. **Five each of *khandhâ*** according to *khandhâ desanâ* ways. 

Now this is the answer to the above query.  This answer is just made  refering to  *nâma- rûpapariccheda ñâna* (insight knowledge of mind and matter)* = *ditthivisuddhi* (purification of views). 

` `Suppose you have come up to *paccayapariggaha ñâna* (knowledge of discerning the cause and result), you must discern the cause and result at every thought moment. (This will be appreciated well in section on Paticcasamppâda). 

A meditator ultimate reality of every individual of the ultimate element of the  five- fold aggregate, by way of *lakkhana-rasa-paccupatthâna*-*padatthâna*, at individual thought moment  of  the   *cakkhudvâravîthi*  and  *manodvâravîthi*  ,  when  he  has  come  up  to Lakkhanâdicatukka.  (This will be clear in section on Lakkhanâdicatukka). 

Again, if the meditator has attained the stage of *viappsanâ* he will have to concentrate on the three general characters, *anicca-dukkha-anatta*, of the ***khandhâ**, **âyatana*** and ***dhâtu***, which are present at every thought moment of the *cakkhudvâravîthi* and *manodvâravîthi*.   (This will be clear in section on Vipassanâ).   It is the same in the case of concentration on sound. 

All these are instructions of the Pâli-Atthakathâ-Tîkâ indicating how, when and what to discern regarding the *paramatta* elements while at seeing and hearing stages. 

For  the  meditators  who  are  searching  for  the  true  *dhamma*s  of  the  Buddha  the Sabbaññuta Sammâsambuddha, those who are willing to penetratively understand, even in this existence, *asankhatadhâtu*, the element of peacefulness leading to the Path and the Fruit, those who are eager to be delivered from the *apâya* (miserable existences), those who are willing to be relieved entirely of the miserable ageing, death and decay, these are  

the instructions to take to heart, follow carefully and obediently. 

HE WHO DEFIES ABHIDHAMMÂ 

*Abhidhammam patibâhunto imassamin jinacakke pahâram deti, sabbaññutaññânam patibâhati, satthu vesârijjañânam patinivatteti, sotumâkam parisam visamvâdeti, ariya- magge âvaranam bandhati*.  *Atthârasasu bhedakaravatthusu ekassamin sandissati, ukkhepanîyakammakijjanîyakammâraho hoti*.  *Tam tam lammam katvâ uyojetabbo “gaccha vighâsâdo hutvâ jîvissatî”ti* (*Abhi.-Ttha*.-1: 30). 

The above descriptions in the Atthakathâ are a warning to those who deny that the Abhidhammâ is not admonished by the Buddha, and to those who are under the impression that the *vipassanâ* exercise need not be made on the ultimate truth of *rûpa* and *nâma*, called the *khandhâ*, *âyatana* and *dhâtu*, as instructed in the Abhidhammâ.  What it  

really means is as follows. 

One who rejects the fact that Abhidhammâ is Buddha’s expatiation and hinders it, and that the *rûpa* and *nâma*, called the truth of *khandhâ*, *âyatana*, and *dhâtu*, that have been expounded in the Abhidhammâ should not and need not be meditated, is in fact hindering and deviating from the Buddha’s noble *sâsanâ*.  He is preventing the Buddha’s *sabbaññnuta ñâna* knowledge of Omniscience.  He lets down the Buddha’s brave *vesârajja ñâna* (the brave knowledge of perfect self-confidence).  He misleads those who are willing to listen to and practice the Abhidhamma dhamma (= *rûpa-nâma* in Abhi-dhammâ are not concerned with *sâvaka*s but are for Sabbaññ Sammâsambuddha and the *Arahant*s—those who are willing to listen to the Abhidhammâ are misled in this way to an erroneous concept).  It is the same as blocking the Path leading attain nobleness; it is one of distinct the factors that causes that brought about dissention among the Sanghâ 

` `called *bhedakara* (causing disunion in the Sanghâ). 

That  *Mahâthera* should neglected from daily affairs by the Sanghâ and to relieve him from the Buddhist order = an act of *upakkhepaniyakam*.  He should be censured by Sanghâ by way of *tajjniyakam*.   [What it means is: the argument that Buddhabhâsita (Buddha’s utterances) Abhidhamma is not the Buddhabhâsita is referred to as *vivâda* (contention).  “The Buddha Abhidhammâ would not bestow any benefit on human beings, the *sâvaka*s cannot meditate on the ultimate truth of the *rûpa* and *nâma*, how could any one concen-trate on these hundreds of millions of  *nâma dhamma*s which would have arisen and perished away within a blinking moment.” The demerit of the Abhidhamma are again indicated in this way.  Now the argument  on  the  Abhidhammâ  from  negative  side  means  committing   *dhamma  avannabhâsana*  (speaking bad of  

dhamma).  The *ukkhepaniyakam* as well as *tajjaniya* action should be taken on him.]. 

By taking these actions he should be sent off ordering him “Eater of others’  remainder—Make your living as a pauper.” (*Abhi.-Tha*.-1: 30). 

Gentlemen,  if  you  are  willing  to  attain  nibbâna,  be  careful  not  criticize  the Abhidhamma  without  reason  and  be  obedient  to  the  warnings  contained  in  the  above Atthakathâ. 

**THE FOUR-FOLD *VESÂRAJJA ÑÂNA*** 

Bhikkhûs ….  The Buddha’s brave knowledge called *vesârajja ñâna* are of four-fold.  The Lord fully endowed with these *vesârajja ñâna*s has declared himself to be the highest and possessed of sabbaññuta ñâna.  He possesses self-confidence in preaching of the way leading to salvation to the people.  He sets into Motion the Wheel of Truth.   

These four are as follows. 

5. The Buddha who declares himself to have penetratively realized, without any one’s help, by *sayambhû ñâna* (self-dependent knowledge) and to be the Sammâsambuddha (the perfectly enlightened one), said “I have acquired peace and tranquility, freedom and bravery, because no one, be a *sâmana*, a *byamana*, a *devâ*, a *mâra*, in this world can argue as there still are *dhamma*s that I have not realized.” 
5. To the Buddha, who has declared himself to be a *khinâsava* (one whose mind is free from the mental obsessions), in whom all the *âsava dhammas* have been extinguished 
   1. an *Arahant*,  it  has been  asserted  as  “such  and  such *âsava*  still  remained  to be extinguished.”   I  have  not  come  across  any  *nimitta*  (sign),  in  either  *samana*,  or *byamana*, or *deva*, or *mâra* or any one in this world, who could have the right reason to indicate so.  For this reason I have attained the peace and tranquility, freedom and bravery. 
5. “The* assertion that the *dhamma*s that I have admonished are impediment to *jâna- magga-phala* is, in fact, not so to those who practice these *dhamma*s.”  I have not encountered any *nimitta* in either the *samana*, or *byamana*, or *deva*, or *mâra* or any one in this world, who could have the right reason to indicate so. For this reason I have come to acquire the peace and tranquility, freedom and bravery. 
5. “The indications that the *dhamma*s that I have given for purpose of cessation of the suffering from the rounds of rebirth, in fact, cannot afford deliverance to any one practicing  on  these  *dhamma*s.”  I  have  not  encountered  any  *nimitta*  in  either  the *samana*, or *byamana*, or *deva*, or *mâra* or any one in this world, who could have the right reason to indicate so. For this reason I have come to acquire the  

`      `peace and tranquility, freedom and bravery. 

Bikkhus ---- These are the 4-fold *vesârajja nanas* causing bravery.  The Buddha, endowed with these *vesârajja nanas* and admitting to possess *sabbaññuta ñâna*,  delivered the *dhamma*s bravely and set the wheel of *dhamma* into motion (*Am*.-1: 315.  *Vesârajja-Suttana*). 

Of these four-fold *vesârajja ñâna*, pay a careful attention to the fourth *vesârajja ñâna*. 

As  has  been  repeatedly  explained  previously—in  Salâyatanavagga  Samyutta  Pâli Aparijânana-Suttana  that  if  the  *rûpa*  and  *nâma  dhamma*  not  completely  understood analytically by means of the 3-fold pariñña paññâ to attain the *magga* and *phala*, there is  

no way of liberating from the suffering of sansâric circus (*Sam*.-2: 249 – 250). 

The eight noble *dhamma*s, called pubbbhâga satipatthâna magga preceding the *ariya magga*  (the  Noble  Path)  have  to  be  meditated,  by  the  three-fold  *pariññâ  paññâ*   to analytically realize the *rûpa* and *nâma* so as to attain *magga* and *phala*.  The 8-fold magga, the noble practice, are the *niyyânika dhamma*s (sanctifying factors) leading to salvation.  In other words, if these 8-fold *magga dhamma*s are practiced step by step, the *rûpa* and *nâma* are analytically realized by the 3-fold *pariñña paññâ* to have attained the *magga* and *phala*.  Such a realization itself is the *niyyânika dhamma* delivering one from  

the suffering of sansâric circus* (the rounds of rebirth). 

Suppose you are under the impression that “the *rûpa* and *nâma* given in the Abhi- dhammâ are not to be concentrated, but such and such phenomena, other than *rûpa* and *nâma*,  are to be concentrated in such and such a way.”    With reference to such a person  

the Atthasâlini Atthakathâ Sayâdaw given an explanation. 

“An individual who hinders the Abhidhammâ is infact defying the noble dhamma called Buddha sasanâ.  He is reproving the *sabbaññuta ñâna* of the Buddha.  He is letting down the Buddha’s very brave *vesârajja nana*.  He is misleading those gentle persons who are  willing  to  listen  to  and  to  practice  the  good  *dhamma*.”  (*Abhi.-Ttha*.-1:  30).  **Even a learned can err sometime**. 

**THE *ITTHÂRAMMANA*-*ANITTHÂRAMMANA* CONCEPT** 

\2.  *Samâsana Vâda* (Theory of Similar Concept) 

To begin with, similar statements made by honorable teachers, called the *Samâsana vâda*, is be presented. 

The *ârammana* (the object) that is unpleasant and should not be sought (*rûpa-vedanâ- saññâ-sankhâra*) is the anitthârammana.  Whoever seeks that ârammana, in fact, it is the ârammana that should not be concentrated upon.  It is the kind of ârammana that is not acceptable,  unglamorous,  not  to  be  taken  to  heart,  that  is  not  conducive  to  *kusala  citta* (meritorious mind). 

In fact, it is completeness = far from pleasantness and hence an* unpleasant *âram- mana* that should not be accepted nor sought after.  [The *Sampatti* here refers to *sampatti*  *bhava* (blissful life) of sentient beings and *devâ*s.] 

In fact, the *anitthârammana* (physically), among the *kamma*-produced corpo-reality, are the results of karmically unwholesome deeds.  (These are the *vipâka nâma*  

groups that have arisen from the *akusala kamma* of *nâma dhamma*). 

Because  it  not  the  cause  for  the  *sukhavedanâ*,  this  *ârammana*  should  not  be acceptable.  Because it is not the true cause for the *sukhavedanâ* in the kind of *citta* that is  not conducive to mental faculty. 

In  this  mind-produced  corporeality,  the  five-fold  *ârammana  karmaguna*  (5-fold craving) produced by *akusala kamma* are all *anitthârammana*.  There is not such a thing as *anitthârammana*  in  *kamma*-produced  corporeality  arising  from  *kusala  kamma*.   All  the *kamma*-produced corporeality following the *kusala kamma* are the *itthârammana* (Abhi.- Ttha.-2: 8-9). 

The  arising  of  the  *kamma*-produced  *ittha-anittha*  is  related  to  the  sentient  being bringing about that *kamma*-produced corporeality.  If a living being has cultivated *akusala kamma*, then it will encounter an *anittârammana kamma*-produced corporeality. If it is the *kusala kamma* that is cultivated, an *itthârammana kamma*-produced corporeality will be the result in due course.  ***Tasmâ kammajanam itthanitthatâ kamma-kârakasatthassa vasena yojanârahâ siya***. (*Mûlatî*.-2: 8). 

**A CUP OF PRICELESS MEDICINE** 

The explanations given by this Atthakathâ-tîkâ are a priceless medicine for a gentle man.  The encounter of various unpleasant *anitthârammana* is the result of the cultivation of *akusala kamma* in the past.  One should not grumble by various sorts reasons as “It is because of something that it has occurred.  If so, then you are committing  

a great blunder referred to as *ayoniso manasikara* (a purposeless attention). 

When the *kusala kamma* is still in force, then that *kamma* will always be creating encounters with discontent *ârammana* and the discontent sentient beings.   Whenever the anitthârammana are encountered, and if they can be taken heart as “well, every body is the nmaker of his own future,” then in your *santâna* (life-continuum) *yonisomanasikara* ( a wise attention), the true basic causes of *kusala*, has made its appearance.  If the three characters of anitthârammana are concentrated by vipassanâ until their ultimate truth is acquired, then it is a kind of *yonisomanasikara* which has attained the peak of *vipassanâ*  

*ñâna* (insight knowledge). 

**AN EXPLANATION BY *MÛLATÎKÂ*** 

`            `The above *atthakathâ* has explained—***kusalakammajam anittham nâma natthi*** =  as a rule, *kamma*-produced corporeality resulting from *kusala kamma* never is an *anitthâ*- *rammana*.  The explanation does not include ***Akusalakammajam nittham nâma natthi*** = 

as a rule, *kamma*-produced corporeality resulting from *akusala kamma* never is an *itthâ*- *rammana*.   Because of this situation, if *akusala kamma*-produced *rûpa* happens to be pleasant (even though it is an *anitthârammana* for you who have cultivated *akuso kamma* beforehand), it may be *itthârammana* for other sentient beings.  Again other teachers are of the opinion that all the *kuso kamma*-produced corporealities are *itthârammana* for both  

self and others. 

As a continuation further explanations will be given.  Some sentient beings do not appreciate nor like the human features and his appearance.  Because of this dislike they would run away from his presence.  In the same way humans are frightened by the appearance and features of the *devâ*s.  Though the humans and sentient beings are scared away, the *cakkhuviññâna* (visual perception) etc. of *vipâkaviññâna* (resultant perception) takes that corporeality as object (physical object) that has arisen in the *santâna* of these frightened beings, appear as just the *kusalavipâkaviññâna*.  Similarly, in living beings scared of humans and humans scared of the *devâ*s, these features as *ârammana* cannot be pleasant because they lack the power resulting from good deed.  This is the opinion of the some *kecisayâ*s.  (The idea of *kecisayâ*’s is that all *kusala kamma*-produced corporealities are *itthâramman*.   Those who do not have adequate power in their *santâna* find these not charming when they come across these *itthârammana*. As the mûlatîkâsayâdaw disagrees  with these assertions, he has retorted as follows.) 

The explanation of the *Atthakathâ sayâ* is that the absence of *anitthârammana* in all  *kusala*   the   *kamma*-produced  corporeality  as  well  as  the  absence  of  the  pleasant *itthârammana* in all the *akusalakamma-produced* corporeality, is an apt explanation. 

Indeed, the *kamma*-produced corporeality in the *santâna* of the sentient beings,  

like elephant etc. during the start of life, are the result of *akusala kamma* performed during a certain  past  existence.   The  encounter  by  humans  of  the  *akusala  kamma*-produced corporeality of these beings, such as elephant etc., are the *akusalavipâkacitta* that appear due to taking these as object in their *santâna*.  (It means *Pañcaviññâna-sam- paticcha-nasantîrana-tadârammana*). 

When  such beings  as  elephant  etc.  has  grown  into  adult  after  growing  gradually, called *pavatti* (formative stage), however, after period of rebirth stage, (to become a *mangala hsin* (lucky elephant) the *kuso kamma*-produced corporeality have the chance to make its appearance.  (The elephant, before attaining an elephant’s life when *akusala* *dhamma*s are cultivated to attain such a life on one hand, while on the other hand *kusala* meritorious deeds, such as *dâna* (alms-offering), were made so that both *kusala* and *akusala* are amix.  If rebirth resultant occurs because *akusala* has acquired more chance, the *kusala kamma* result can also arise so that *pavatti* results may occur in continuation.  By the power of *kusala kamma*, which could produce *pavatti* results, *kusala kamma*- produced corporeality in the form of a white elephant etc. may make its appearance.) 

By taking as object the *kusala kamma*-produced corporeality of sentient beings, such elephant etc., called *itthârammana*, which have gradually grown at the time of *pavatti* period, *kusalavipâkacitta*  can  arise  in  humans.   (*Pañcaviññâna-sampaticchana-  santîrana- tadârammana-citta* is meant here.) 

The encounter by humans of *itthârammana* is also related to their *kusala kamma*,  

but not to that sentient beings such as elephant etc.  

Although it is true that the *kamma*-produced corporeality of sentient beings such as elephants etc. can be an object of the human *kusalavipâkaviññâna*, but in the santâna of the sentient  beings  can  there  be  *itthârammana  kamma*-derived  corporeality  as  well  as  the *anitthârammana kamma*-derived corporeality.  It means that as there can be *kusala kamma*- derived  corporeality  referred  to  as  *itthârammana*,  so  can  there  be  the  akusala-  kamma- produced  corporeality,  called  the  *initthâramma*.   Therefore,  the  *itthârammana*  and *anitthârammana* are mingled.  In such a mingled state in the elephant etc., *anitthâ*-*rammana rûpa* called the *akusala kamma*-produced corporeality is only a minor case in the *santâna* of it when maturity is attained at a time of *pavatti* period. The *itthârammana*, the *kusala kamma*- derived corporeality (adequate enough to have attained the state of a *mangalâ* elephant) of the previous and present, however, is an overlapping major case. Therefore, however mingled the *itthârammana* of *kusala kamma*-produced and *anitthâ-rammana* of *akusala kamma*-produced corporealities may be, the *akusala kamma*-produced *anitthârammana*, as a minority, cannot be  the  real  cause  for  arising  of  the  many  *akusalvipâkacitta*  in  the  *santâna*  of  humans.   Probably, it could be asserted this way.  (In the *santâna* of elephant etc., during the time of *pavatti* period, only the *itthâramma*, which are the majority, is taken as object.  In the *santâna* of humans, concentrating on the *itthârammana*, *kusalavipâkacitta* has the chance to arise.  For this reason, *akusala kamma* produced-corporeality-*anitthârammana* cannot be the cause for the appearance of the *akusalavipâkacitta* in the humans.  This is what the whole idea is meant).  (Mûlatî-2: 8). 

**THE OUTSTANDING FRATURES OF THE TWO *VÃDA***S** 

According to the *kecivâda* the splendid material forms, arising in the sentient beings such elephants when they have gradually attained maturity, are only the *anitthâ-rammana* *rûpa akusala kamma*-produced corporeality due to their cultivation in the past  

of the *akusalakamma*. 

According  to  Mûlatîkâsayâdaw,  the  *patisandhe  kammaja  rûpa*  (*kamma*-produced rebirth  phenomena)  of  the  elephant  etc.  are  only  the  *akusala  kamma*-produced  *anitthâ- rammana rûpa*.  It has been exsaptiated that the splendid *rûpa*s, which appear at *pavatti* period  when  maturity  is  attained,  are  the  *kusokammajarûpa*s  =  the  *itthârammana  rûpa*s, which were cultivated in the past existence of these sentien beings.  (That is to mean that the ugly and inferior *rûpa*s are the *akusalakammaja rûpas*.  It is consistent with Añgutta- ranikâya Dassakanippâtti Jânusoni-suttana.  See *Am*. 3: 478 – 482). 

***So tattha lâbhî hotî**ti so tattha hatthiyoniyam nibbattopi mañgalahatthitthânam patvâ  lâbhî hoti*. (*Am.- Ţha.* 3: 339). 

In the *santâna* of elephant etc., during pavatti period, although the *itthârammana rûpa* 

- *akusalakammaja rûpa* and *anitthârammana rûpa* = *akusalakammaja rûpa* are intermingled, the  latter  are  infinitesimal,  but  *kusalakammaja  rûpa*s  are  of  considerable  magnitude.  Therefore, the Mûlatîkâsayâdaw is of the opinion that such an infinitesimal *akusalakammaja rûpa*s cannot be the cause for the arising of *akusalavipâkacitta* in the *santâna* of sentient beings like humans.  The sayâdaw once again expounded as given below. 

*Vipâkam pana kattaco na sakka vañcetunti vipâkavasena itthânitthârammanava-vatthânam sutthu vuttam*.  *Tasmâ tam anugantvâ sabbattha itthânitthatâ yojetabbâ.* 

` `(*Mûlaţî*- 2: 8). 

Again  in  whichever  *ârammana*  it  may  be,  the  *vipâkviññâna*  cannot  be  deceived.  Because  of  this  determination  of  *itthârammana*  or  *anitthârammana*  by  virtue  of *vipâkaviññâna*    (*Abhi.Ttha.-*  2:10),  as  explained  by  Tipitakasûlâbhayathera,  has  been mentioned  in  attakthâ.   Therefore,  the  determination  *ittha*  and  *anittha*  by  power  of  that *vipâkaviññâna*  only,  the  formation  of  *ittha*  and  *anittha  ârammana*  should  be  associated (Mûla*ţ*î.-2: 8). 

Now this is the similarity of meaning by all the *atthakathâ sayâdaws*, the similar *attakathâ* = *samanavâda*. 

*VITANTA VÂDÎ VÂDA* 

SOPHISTRY 

An individual who would make fallacious speech that could disheartened the men  

of wisdom is the vitandavâdî (a sophist).  He would speak oout as 

***Itthânittham** nâma pâtiyekkam pativibattam natthi*,  *tesam tesam rûcivasena kathitam*  (Abhi.-Ttha.-2: 9). 

There is no such a thing a the *itthârammana* and *anitthârammana* which can be analyzed individually  as  a  single  item  each.   Determination  of  an  *ârammana*  as  either  the *itthârammana* or the *anitthârammana* is related to individual living being’s like or dislike of it (that *ârammana*).  To the Great King Kosala the Buddha himself has admonished as  follows. 

- The Great King …. Among the five-fold *kâmaguna ârammana*, I have indicated that 

only the *ârammana* that is attractive and the heart’s liking is the extreme determinant and is noble.  The Great King …. Even that individual *årammana*s can be a heart stimula-ting for some, but not for the others.  The Great King …. A single kind of sounds, smells, tastes and touches can be the balm to the heart of some, but not to that of others.”  This what the Lord has expatiated in Sagâthâ-vaggakosala-samyutta Pañcarâja-suttana (Sam.- 

1: 80). 

With  reference  to  the  method  as  indicated  above,  a  single  *rûpârammana,  saddâ*- *rammana,  ganfhârammana,  pholabbârammana*  etc.  may  be  pleasant  and  attractive *ârammana* for one, and cause the arising of clinging, attachment and *lobha* (greed) to that *ârammana*.  To the other these *ârammana*s could cause anger, a feeling of sorrow, and hate.  These *ârammana*s themselves may be the attractive, pleasing and adorable *itthâramman*s for one.  These may again be the disgusting, disagreeable and unadorable  

*anitthârammana*s for the other. 

The same *ârammana*s are taken  by optimist as pleasing and adorable, on the other hand, they displeasing unadorable for a pessimist.  Therefore, there no such a thing  

as *ittârammana* separate from *anitthârammana* in its own entity. 

In  fact   countrymen  living  in  the  extreme  periphery  *paccantavâthî*)  of  the Majjhimadesa (the Middle Region) would find even the earthworms to be *itthârammana*, *attractive* and *adorable*.  For those living right inside the Majjhimadesa, however, would find these earthworms to be *anitthârammana*, irritable and rejectable.  Again the *paccan-tavâthî*, the countrymen, would find the meat of peacock to be irritable, inedible and unpleasant.  This is the the way of thinking of vitantavâdî with regard to itthârammana  

and anitthârammana (Abhi.-Ttha.-2: 9). 

THE REPLY 

In response to the idea of *vitantavâdî*, the *atthakathâ* has retored as follow. Ask the vitantavâdî as 

Do you mean there is no such a thing as *itthârammana* and *anitthârammana*  in its entity to determine separately? 

Suppose his answer was “*âma natthi* = well, no, there is not.”  Ask him the same question three times, and make  him answer *âma natthi* three times admittedly.  After- wards give him a problem to see what his answer would be. 

The question is “Is the *Nibbâna atta* or *anatta*”?  The *vitanta vâdî* might answer,  through knowledge of his own, indeed nibbâna is the *itthârammana*. 

He might remain silent, but in fact nibbâna is the *itthârammana*. 

Some people are sensitive and become angry when the merits of the nibbâna are mentioned, and would angrily answer as follow. 

Well now you are talking about the merits and goodness of the *nibbâna*.  I would like to ask you if there were adequate and various kinds of eatables, flowers, perfume, essence, cosmetics, clothings and place to sleep—the five-fold *kâmaguna ârammana* in  

the nibbâna?  

The answer to question put by the *vitanda vâdî* would simply be “No.”  If such an answer is given by *sakavâdî*, a person whose idea is with the framework of the *sâsanâ*, and in continuation the *vitanda vâdî* should be told: You would close your ears and say  

“No.  *Alam tava nibbânena* = your nibbâna would be not advantageous.” 

The great noble *nibbâna dhamma* is indeed an *itthârammana*.  Even though it is so, there are no five-fold *kâmaguna ârammana*s to enjoy, for which the *nibbâna* when  

viewed from the *vitanda vâdî*’s standpoint comes to be known as *anitthârammana*. 

*Anitthârammana* it may be for those who does not want, the great noble *nibbâna dhamma* should not and must not be taken as *anitthârammana*.  A person who implied the nibbâna  to  be  anittha  is  one  who  possesses  *viparitasaññâ*  (altered  perception)  =  wrong perception associated with the *lobha* (greed) associated with the enjoyment of the five-fold *kâmaguna ârammana*s.  Because of this wrong perception, he has asserted the remark “Hold it.  There is no benefit derivable from your nibbâna.” 

Because  of  changes  of  perception  =  *vippanlâsa*  (transposition)  alteration  in  the perception, an *ârammana* may be *itthârammana* for one who is in search of it.  At the same time that *ârammana* may be disagreeable and unacceptable for another (Abhi.- Ttha.-2: 9 – 10). 

Now these are the assertions in atthakathâ made in response to that of the *vitanda* 

*vâdî*. 

***SAÑÑÂVIPALLÂSA*** 

(**THE CONCEPT TRANSPOSITION**) 

The perceptions associated with *lobha* clinging to the *kâmaguna ârammana*s, which are  not  the  true  *ittha*,  and  believe  them  to  be  the  *ittha*,  the  *nibbâna  dhamma*  and  other *ârammana*s which are wrongly taken to be the true *anitth*—the perceptions which  here are said  to  be  *viparitasaññâ*  =  perceptions  subject  to  changes.   That  *viparitasaññâ*  is  again explained  as  *saññâvipallâsa*.   Because  of  the  *viparitasaññâ*  the  nibbâna,  which  lacks *kâmaguna ârammana*s inform of food and enjoyable substances, he simply honestly said “alam tava nibbânena = That is enough. There is no benfit in your nibbâna.”  The majority of the present day persons wishing for “immediate attainment of *nibbâna*” are, infact, usually have one thing in mind and another in the mind.  They want to acquire the nibbâna in no time.  They, however, do not practice in the right way to attain the nibbâna following the right  path.   Having  a  heart  of  acquiring  nibbâna,  though  they  cannot  practice  presently, should be said to have a great merit. 

**THE THREE-FOLD *VIPALLÂSA*** 

***Vipallâsâ**ti anicca-dukkha-anatta-asubhesuyeva vatthûsu iccam sukhan attâ subha”ti  evum pavatto saññâvipallâso cittavipallâso ditthivipallâso ime tayo* (Visuddhi-2: 324). 

In the five-fold *upâdânakkhandhâ rûpa-nâma dhamma*s, which are the true *anicca, dukkha,  anatta*  and  *asubha*,  in  other  words  in  the  *dukkha-saccâ*  and  *samudaya-saccâ dhamma*s, there are three-fold *vippllâsa*s: 

4. Wrong perception as (a) *Nicca*, (b) *Sukha*, (c) *Atta*, (d) *Subha*  =  *Saññâvipallâsa* 
4. Wrong notion as (a) *Nicca*, (b) *Sukha*, (c) *Atta*, (d) *Subha*  =  *Cittavipallâsa* 
4. Wrong view as (a) *Nicca*, (b) *Sukha*, (c) *Atta*, (d) *Subha*  =  *Ditthivipallâsa.* 

In  this  way  there  are  three-fold  *vippllâsa*s  as  *Saññâvipallâsa,  Cittavipallâsa,*  and *Ditthivipallâsa.*  There are four categories in each making it 12-fold of *vippllâsa* *dham-* 

*ma*s (Visuddhi-2: 324). 

Perceptions subject to change = *viparitasaññâ* arise because the *vippalâsa dhamma*s distinctly do exist from which no deliverance has been attained.  Based on the *viparita saññâ*, the living beings wrongly perceived *ittha* as *anittha* and vice versa.   They are having wrong notions and wrong perceptions and these are, indeed, the *ayoniso manasikâra* (the unwise attensions).  There is every possibility that *akusala dhamma*s  

could arise based on these *ayoniso maniasikâra*. 

**DETERMINATION OF *IŢŢHÂRAMMANA* AND *ANIŢŢHÂRAMMANA*  ACCORDING**  

**INDIVIDUALS OF MEDIOCRE LIVING BEINGS** 

*Iţţhânitthârammanam pana pâtiyakkam vibhattam aţţhîti*.  *Kassa vasena vibhattanti*?  *Majjhimakasattassa* (*Abhi.- Ţţha*.-2: 10). 

Determination of *iţţhârammana* and *iniţţhârmmana* is given in the *Aţţhakathâ*. It is not  ture  that  there  never  exist  *iţţhârammana*  and  *aniţţhârammaņa*  as  asserted  by  the *vitandavâdî*.   Then  how  is  it  determined  which  are  *iţţhâramaņa*  and  which  are *aniţţhârammaņa*?  The explanation in the Aţţhakathâ is that it is made by virtue of wish a Mediocre person. 

Further explanation.  Determination of an *ârammaņa* as either *iţţha* or *aniţţha* should, however, be made by virtue of the great president, the King Mahâsudassanasak-kâya, King Dhammâsoka etc., who are of great  power.   Indeed, these powerful rulers, belonging to the higher strata, are not contended with nor appreciate an *ârammana* like ordinary foods, of celestial origin, comparable to the five-fold *ârammana karmaguna*, though the food is an *itthâramman*.  In their mind  this *ârammana* is taken to heart as not 

appreciable nor stumlating to their heart. 

For very poor, and of low strata, humans and sentient beings for whom getting a daily meal is hard effort, even the meal made broken rice, foul rice and curry would be delicious and will be *ittha* though it is indeed *anittha*. 

In dertermining whether an *ârammana* is *ittha* or *anittha*, it should be according to the middle class humans’ (Pâmokkha, Minister, rich man, merchant etc.) definition. 

Therefore,  good  *rûpa-sadda-gandha-rasa-pholabba-dhamma*  for  middle  class humans are all *itthârammana*s.  The hard-to-come-by physical appearance and the sound of the Sammasambuddha etc. and those of man and woman are very pleasant and adorable *ati- itthârammana*s.    The smell of faecal materials, rotten dead dog and man are of repulsive 

kinds;  disturbing  sounds,  unpleasant  smell,  disagreeable  tastes  and  touches  are *anitthârammana*s. This is how determination is made regarding the *itthârammana* and  *anitthârammana*.  This is the *atthakathâvâda*; the *samânavâda*. (*Abhi.-Ttha*.-2: 10).   

In this *vâda*, note that the formation of *ittha* or *anittha* on an object among the upper. Medium and lower strata humans does not occur during the *vipâkaviññâna*, but during by ***javanasena*** = the force of *javanna* (impulsion)   

***TIPIŢAKACÛLÂBHAYATTHERA VÂDA*** 

*Tipiţakacûļâbhayatthero panâha — “Iţţhâniţţham nâma vipâkavasena paricchinnam, na javanavasena.  Javanam pana saññâvippallâsavasena iţţhassamim yeva rijjati*, *iţţhas-samim yeva dussati*.  *Aniţţhassamim yeva rijjati*,  *aniţţhassamim yeva dussatî"ti*.  *Vipâkavaseneva panetam ekantato paricchijjati*.  *Na hi sakkâ vipâkacittam vañcetom*.  *Sace ârammaņam iţţham hoti*, *kusalavipâkam upajjati*.  *Sace aniţţham*, *akusalavipâkam*  

*upajjati* (*Abhi-Ţţha-*2: 10). 

The Venerable *Tipiţakacûļâbhayatthera* has indicated as follows. 

The *iţţhârammaņa* and *aniţţhârammaņa* are determined not by the force of *javana* (impulsion) but by the force of *vipâkaviññâņa* (consciousness acquired through practice).  Because of wrong concept = the clinging, the attachment = may result in *lobha*, and also *dosa*, can be formed within a single *iţţhârammaņa* by force of *vipaļâsa*.  Within a single *aniţţhârammaņa*  can  be  formed  the  attachment  =  *lobha*,  and  also  *dosa*.   Therefore,  the *iţţhârammaņa* and *aniţţhârammaņa* should not be determined on the basis of the force of *javana*. 

Therefore,  the  *iţţhârammaņa*  and  *aniţţhârammaņa*  should  be  determined  only  by virtue  of *vipâkaviññâņa*.   In  fact *vipâkacitta*  never  deceives.   An *ârammaņa*  may be  an *iţţhârammaņa*—(let  the *javana*  dominated by  any  one  of  *kusla*,  *akusala*, *somanassa*,  *do- manassa*,  *upakkhâ*),  then  the  *vipâkaviññâņa*s  are  definitely  *kusalavipâka,  pañcaviññâņa*, *sampaţicchana*, *santîrana* of *tadârammaņa*s.  An *ârammaņa* may be an *aniţţhâram-maņa*— (let the *javana* dominated by any one of *kusla*, *akusala*, *somanassa*, *do-manassa*, *upakkhâ*), then  the  *vipâkaviññâņa*s  are  definitely  *akusalavipâka,  pañcaviññâņa*,  *sampaţicchana*, *santîrana* of *tadârammaņa*s.  For this reason, the determination of the  

*iţţhârammaņa* and *aniţţhârammaņa* should, in deed, be made by virtue of *vipâkaviññâņa*. *Kiccâpi hi micchâdiţţhikâ Buddham vâ samgham vâ mahâcetiyâdîni vâ uļârâni âram-manâni disvâ  ekkhîni  pidahanti*,  *domanassam  âpajjanti*,  *dhammasaddam  sutvâ  kaņņe  thakanti*, *cakkhuviññâņasotaviññâņâni pana nesam kusalaviâkâneva honti* (*Abhi-Ţţha-*2: 10). *Micchâdiţţhi* (wrong viewers), those with conception outside the bounds of the *sâsanâ*,turn their blind eyes when they encounter *Sammâsambuddha* (the Enlightened One), or Ariya- Sanghâ (the Noble Sanghâ) or Mahâ-Cetiya (e.g. Shwedagon) etc. of noble *ârammaņa*s; feel unhappy at heart.  They would close their ears when the Buddha's sermon is heard.
