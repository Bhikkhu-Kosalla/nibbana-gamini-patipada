ū
When the meditator has clearly discerned the _rûpa_ phenomena in his conscious-ness, so would the _nāma_ phenomena be. In such a discernment of the _nāma_ factors, there are three ways:

1. The method of concentration starting with _phassa_ (contact),
1. The method of concentration starting with _vedanā_ (suffering),
1. The method of concentration starting with consciousness _viññāṇa_ (perception).
   ūūūūū
   If the meditator concentrated on the *nāma dhamma*s via one of these three ways, then _vedanā-saññā-sañkhāra-viññāṇa_, referred to as the four-fold _nāmakhandhā_, are recog-nized as the ***nāmadhamma*s** which** will be acquired in his conscious mind. _Mahābhûta_ = the four great elements and all the *upādārûpa*s which take the four great elements as their object, are recognized as \***rûpa dhamma***s. In this way the 18 elements, 12-fold *āyatana*s, the five-fold *khandhā*s and all those factors in the three planes of existence = these innumerable *rûpa*- *nāma dhamma*s have been definitely and clearly defined. It comes to the realization that there are just the *nāma* and *rûpa* in the three planes of life, above which there exist no higher ***individuality-sentient being-life-self-human-devā-byahmā\*\*\*

(*Visuddhi-*2: 227 - 228).
ūūū
According to the above instruction, when one is able to discern both _rûpa_+_nāma_ at every thought along the path of cittaniyāma, then these _rûpa_ + _nāma_ are taken as object of concentration to discern that in these there are **no** **“individuality-sentient being-life-self-human-_deva_-_byahmā_**, but **just the _rûpa_ + _nāma_**.
ūū
The determination is made of the _rûpa_+_nāma_ as explained above. (When one has acquired the ability to extend his consciousness to _bhahiddha_ and collectively meditate on the _bhahiddha rûpa_+_nāma_ in the 31 planes, then one would clearly realize the non-

existence of human-_devā_-_byahmā_).

**An Invaluable Resolution**

-   . ūūūūūū

The commentator in the above Visuddhimagga commentary has explained as: _Sabbepi tebhûmake dhamme nāmañca rûpañcāti dvedhā vavatthapeti =_ *tebhûmaka*s, within the three planes of life referred to as all of the _kāma-rûpa-arûpa_, are recognized as *rûpa dhamma*s as well as *nāma dhamma*s (mental factors, material factors) as two

distinct groups.\* ūū

 Here, the word _sabba_ = completeness = all is meant to include the entire *dhamma*s of the _sañkhāra_ phenomena. _Nāma_ and _rûpa_, however, are taken to be far apart from one another. (They are not the associated *sampayutta dhamma*s, but are dissociated *vippayutta dhamma*s). Therefore, the _nāma_ and *rûpa dhamma*s should not be analyzed

together as a composite group, but be recognized as two distinct groups, and are to be

taken as given below:
ū

1. The *dhamma*s that are of the nature of being attracted towards the object are _nāma_,
1. The *dhamma*s that are subject to change are the _rûpa_. ūūū

Only when so recognized can the non-existence of a certain ūdhamma* (such as the living being, soul, *viññān*.*a* , self) of the *tebhûmaka dhamma*s present in the three planes of life and being free from both *nāma* and *rûpa* — the entire *tebhûmaka dhamma\*s of the three

planes of life are recogniūed as two distinct _nāma_ andū*rûpa dhammas*. And this is what the commentator has streūsed in his explanation.

The expression “_Nāmañca rûpañca_” = _nāmadhamma_ and _rûpadhamma_ is an adequate indication that the _nāma_ and _rûpa_ are two distinct words, yet they are further expressed as _dvedhā vavatthapeti_ = recognized as two distinct groups. It was expressed

3 ūū

so to vindicate the non-existence of a certain _dhamma_ (such as the living being, soul, _viññāṇa_, self) of the *tebhûmaka dhamma*s present in the three plaūes of life and being free from both _nāma_ and _rûpa._

It was expounded in this way to arrive at tūe determination that theūe exist no individual--sentient being-life-self-human-_deva_-_brahmā_ beyond the _nāmarûpa_.

Again, it was expatiated as **_sabbepi tebhûmake dhamme_** = **_tebhûmakadhamma_** — in the word _sabba_ = all is used for purpose of concentration on the three general

characters _aniccū_-_dukkha_-_anatta_ = so as not to leave any of _sammasanupaggadhamma_. ū

Indeed, the _tebhûmakadhamma_ in the three planūs of existence is the _dhamma_ which should entirely be understood analytically; the attachment on to these _tebhûmaka_-*dhamma*s via craving should be eradicated through practice. By practicing to eradicate the craving on these, one should acquire freedom. That is the reason why the Buddha has admonished as follows:

“Bhikkhus .... if the craving for the entire _rûpanāma_ phenomena

1. are not understood penetratively by _ñātapariññā paññā_,
1. are not known analytically by _tīranpariññā_,
1. cannot practice to eradicate and be rūlieved of the attachment to them by craving, then one is not worthwhile to be relieved of the sorrows of the sansāric circus.

“Bhikkhus .... in fact, if the entire _rûpanāma_ phenomena

4. are understood penetratively by _ñātapariññā paññā_,
5. are known analytically by _tīranpariñā_,
6. has practiced to eradicate the attachment to them by craving, then one is worthwhile to be relieved of the sorrows of the sansāric circus (_Sam_.-2: 249 - .

 250).

This resolution has been made in Mahātīkā with reference that of Aparijānanasūttana of Samyuttapāli Salāyatanavaggasamyutta.

1. A statement that Nibbāna can be attained by meditating on just a single _rūpa_ element,
1. A statement that Nibbāna can be attained by meditating on just a single _nāma_ element, and
1. A statement that Nibbāna can be attained by meditating on just a single _rûpa_ element and just a single _nāma_ element.

These three statements are definitely the opposite of the resolution described in Mahātīkā. He who is in search of the right dhamma, however, should not turn his back on the resolution made in Mahātīkā. In fact he should obediently follow that resolution which has been made with reference the Buddha’s verbally delivered discourse. [The

three kinds of _Pariññāpaññā_ have been explained in Bhuddekarata.]

**_D_._I_ ._T_ _THIVISUDDHI_ (PURITY OF VIEW)** ū

_Lakkh_._a_ _na-rasa-paccūpaṭṭhãna-padaṭṭhānavasena nāmarûpapariggaho **diṭṭhivisuddhi** nāma_. (Abhidhamm..a tthasañgaha).

-   Cultivation of _nāmarûpa_ by the power. . of the _lak_._k_ _hana-rasa-paccuppaṭṭhāna-_

_padaṭṭhāna_ (salient feature-taste-manifestation-proximate cause) is .t he purity of the _paramattañān_.. _a_ view = _di_._t_._t_ _hivisuddhi_. (Abhidhammat.t.h asañgaha).

It is the word explained on the basis of the Atthakathās such as Dīghanikāya Mahāvagga Atthakathā = (_Dī-ṭṭha_-2: 53), Sayuttanikāya Nidānavagga Atthakathā = (_Sam_.-

. ū

_ṭṭha_.-2: 44) etc. Therefore, _diṭṭhivisuddhi_ = for the sake of the purity of _paramat_-_thañaa_ view _nāmarûpa_ factors have still to be cultivated via the power of the _lakkhana_-_rasa-_ . _paccupaṭṭhāna-padaṭṭhāna_. The way of such cultivation will be described in separate section

**_Dhātu_** = **element** - _attano sabhāvum dhāretīti dhātu_

It is named _dhātu_ because it possesses its own natural character (_Visuddhi_-2:116). ūū

The _atta_ (self), which is the thought of wrong viewers and whose way of thinking is outside the _sāsanā_, when investigated by _paramattha_ eye of wisdom, does not clearly exist. Its non-existence becomes more clearly realized especially when the _rûpa_ and _nāma_ are investigated by way of the eye of wisdom after realization of their ultimate truth. Nothing other than _rûpa_ and _nāma_ is realized, nor is there the _atta_, as visualized by _ñāna_. _Atta_ is functionally _karaka_ (producer); _atta_ can appreciate _vedaka_ (feeling). In this way _atta_ has been designated to be _karaka_ and _vedaka_, but they are not to be. It cannot function nor feel. It is because the _atta_ itself, is claimed to have functioning or

4

5

feeling property, is non-existent.

The ūltimate truth, sūch as _cakkhu_ (eye) etc., are capable of performing and existing their own nature. For instance

. _Rûpābhighātārahabhûtappasādalakūhanam,_

_Dalukāmatānidānakammasamutthānabhûtappasādalakkhanam vā cakkhu_

(*Visuddhi-*2: 74). ūū

 Element of vision (= eye clear element), upon which impinges on the _bhûtarûpa_ (mental qualities of sense-fields) = possesses nature of giving clear vision on the Four

Great Elements. In other words, it has the nature of giving clear vision of the Four Great Elements caused by _kamma_ arising from wishing to see the material object which are

based on _kāmatahnā_. ūūūū

Asū indicated in Section on Rûpakammatthāna, _rûpa_ phenomena are made up of suūatomic particles called ūkalāpas*. The *kalāpa* is the smallest particle of *rûpa* factors in the sphere of *rûpaparamatta\*. Element of vision too does not exist as individuality but accordingūūūūū

_rûpakalā_ called _cakkhudasakakalāpa_. Included in this _cakkhudasaka kalāpa_ are 10 _rûpa_ phenomena. These *rûpa dhamma*s are the _kamma_-produced corporeality which resulted from _kamma_ cultivated in the past based on causes _avijja-tahnā-upādāna_. The Four Mahābhûta Elements are also included in these 10 *rûpa*s of the _cakkhudasaka kalāpa_. These Mahābhûta Elements are the *dhamma*s on which impinges the _rûpa_ objects It is the natural character of element of vision which causes the clearness of the _mahābhûta_ factors; in every element of vision is present this natural character. Therefore, element of vision has its own nature, and performs in its own nature, and existed in the nature of its own. Note that it also applies to other elements. Since all these 18 *dhamma*s can exhibit the phenomena of the natural characters of their own, they are, therefore,

 nominated as “_dhātu_ = element.”

Among these 18 elements, the element of vision etc., are by now clearly explained A slight treatment on those still not clear will be made. First, mind element, _pañcaviññā_-

_dhātu_ (the five mind element) element of mental cognition will be described.

**_MANODHÃTU_ (ELEMENT OF APPRECIATION)** _Tīni manodhātucittāni ekā manodhātu_. (_Visuddhi_-2: 224).

_1. Pañcadvārāvajjan_; (2) _Ahitakusalavipākasampatcchan_; (3) _Ahitaakusala vipākasampatcchan_, the three kinds of mind are called the _manodhātu_ (element of appreciation).

_Antādikā manodhātu_, _manoviññānadhātuyā_. ū

_Pavesāpagane dvāra-pariyāyene titthti_ (_Nāmarûpapariccheda_).\*

Among the three _citta_ named the _manodhātu_, the _bhavañga_ referred to as the _manoviññāna_ (mind cognition) get dissolved when _pañcadvārāvajjāna_ is attained and is thought to have entered into the state of _pañcadvārāvajjāna_. Therefore, _pañcadvārāvajjāna_ is the _dvāra_ (door) through which _bhvañgamanoviññāna_ enters. Again, the _manoviññāṇa_ called the _santīrana_ (investigation, decision) made its appearance following the _sampaticchana_ (acceptance). _Sampaticchana_, again, functions

6

as the outlet for _manoviññāṇa_. With reference to instructions of this nature, the three\* _manodhātu_ can be taken as the doors for the _manoviññāṇa_. In other words, it means it unusual appreciation.

It is explained in the earlier pages of the section on _Nāmakamma_._t_._t_ _hāna_ etc. that

1. Element of _bhavañgamano_ clearneūs is the _manodvāra_ (mind door), ū
1. _Bhavañgamano_ together with _āvajjana_ (adverting mind) is the _manodvāra_,
1. From point of view of _T_.. _thānûpacāra_ (by way of place) or _phalûpacāra_ (by way of contact, the _hadayavatthu_ (heart-based corporeality) is called the _manodvāra_ too.

(see pages etc.). Taking of _bhavañga_ as the _manodvāra_, and of *bhavañga\*\* together with *āvajjana* as *manodvāra\* is the usual way of appreciation.

In _pañcadvārāvajjana_ (five door contemplation) and _sampaticchānadve_ named as _manodvāra_ (mind door), _pañcadvārāvajjana_, when taken as object, is not effective as taking object of concentration following others nor as repetitively taken object of concentration, because the newly formed object in earlier stage of concentration has been taken only once. That is why the _manodvāravajjana_ and _sampaticchanadve_ are — _mano evadhātu manodhātu_— referred to as the _manodhātu_ because it is an element which

could bring about just the consciousness.

_PAÑCAVIÑÑāNADHāTU_

The *panñviññāna*s have to simply capture the object which directly appear on the receptive corporeality. Therefore, the force of concentration is more than that of the _manodhātu_, and that is the reason why it is nominated as the _viññānadhātu_. It is also named

_visesanajātīti viññānam_ = takes. th. e object more forcefully than the _manodhātu_. Because it is supported by _anantara_ force from the _āvajjana_ (adverting mind), having different objects,

and has to support the _sampaticchana_ having different object, it used to

be less forceful than the _manoviññāna_ supporting the _viññāna_ of similar objects. As instructed in Vibhañga Pāli referred to as Aññatara Abhinipātamatta it is just that falling upon the respective object of the five-fold object.

[***Anantara**—***Someone becomes successful at the expense of someone else**. As this statement goes, two *citta*s (consciousnesses) cannot come about simultaneously, but one after another. (The earlier consciousnesses disappear after facilitating the appearance of the later). The early *citta*s arose and, after facilitating the rising of the later, perish away. Before dissolution of the former, the later *citta*s have no chance to arise. Remember that an old president would relieve himself only after handing over his duties to the new one. The support of the former *citta* for the appearance of the next one is called *anantarapaccaya*.]

THE _MANOVIÑÑāDHÃTU_

Literally _mano_ (mind) refers to “knowledge”, and so also the _manoviññāna_ (mental consciousness) to “special knowledge.” The combination of the two explicitly gives the essence of a “wide knowledge, a very high knowledge and very high and wide knowledge.” The way the realization is acquired by the very high and wide knowledge is

7

this. Unlike the *citta*s described above, it does not take the new object at very early state (even though the capture has to be made in a way similar to _manodvāravajjana_), supported by anantara force of the citta having similar object, supports the later citta of the same material object by force of _anantara_ support. Hence the capture on the object is very effective. Therefore, it is a nominated, from _manoviññānadhātu_ point of view, as

_mano_ with _viññānam_ (see Compendium of Buddhist Philosophy, p.182).

[*Lokūya satta* *viññānadhātuyo* “*manāyataūan*”*ti.*] (Visuddhi 2:224).

1. _Rûpārammana_ (visible object) is the _rûpāyatana_ (visible object base).

1. The 52 _cetasika_ (mental concomitants) and 16 _sukhumarûpa_ (subtle material forms) are all _dhammāyatana_ (mental base).

NOMINATION AS _ÃYATANA_

_Visesato pana āyatanato, āyānam tananato, āyatassa ca **nayanato** **āyatanam**ti Veditabbam_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 112).

It is so named

1. Because of the functions performed by each and every _citta cetasika_ (mind and mental concomitants) on their own.
1. Because of the capability of _āya_ (lengthening) the stretched mind and mental concomitants due to exerting effort by each and every one of them.
1. Because of bearing full suffering of the rounds of rebirth along the _sansāric_ circus.

8 ūū
ū

1. **_Ãyatana_**. It means _āya_ (cause) according to the meaning of the terms. If there is no eye sensitivity and visible object, there can be no _cakkhudvārikavīthicitta_ (mind door thought process). If there are no _cakkhudvārikavīthicitta_, each and every mind and men-tal concomitant, appearing every _cittakhana_ (thought moment) within, these cannot per-form their respective functions. Thus, the _cakkhupasāda_ and _rûpārammana_ are the causes for _cakkhudvāravīthicitta_ and of carrying out the respective functions by the _cakkhudvārika nāma dhammas_ (mental phenomena arising through the eye door). This is the reason why the name _cakkhāyatana_ — _rûpāyatana_ is given. Note that the same applies to the remaining _āyatana_ pairs.
1. Only when there are _cakkhudvāra_ (eye door) and _rûpāyamana_ (physical object), can there be *nāma dhamma*s (mental factors). Without these there be no _cakkhu_-*dvāra nāma dhamma*s. Note that it is also true for _sotadvāra saddārammana_ etc. Each mind and mental concomitant appearing with reference to the corresponding _dvāras_ (doors) are stretched by the *āyatana*s. Like a photographic enlarger which enlarges the small photographs, the *āyatana*s enlarge the mind and mental conco-mitants. If any one (_ayonisomarikāra_ = one having unwise attention) comes across a pleasant sound and agreeable beauty, he would exaggerate on what he has just encountered. But he comes across a disagreeable sound or a feature, he would exaggerate on what he has seen with a wry face. He would be smiling within himself and reflecting in his mind of minds. He would be reminiscing on it. This a kind of enlarging the mind mental concomitant. In the life-continuum of a good man of a _yonisomanasikāra_ (= one having wise attention) the *akusala dham-ma*s (unmeritorious deeds) do not get enlarged on the basis of these *dvārā-rammana*s. The mind and mental concomitants associated with the insight know-ledge, such as _aniccanupassanāñana_, _dukkhanupassanāñana_, _anattaanupassanā-ñana_ etc., however become enlarged. Such a kind of enlargement leads one to the nibbāna, and is worth culturing.
1. In the infinite rounds of rebirth (_sansāra_), with no beginning, the long suffering of _sansāravatta_ (sansāric function) has not yet ceased with non-reappearing cessation, the _anupādanirodha_. As long as they remain, these *āyatana*s would be bearing the full-fledged suffering of the sansāric circus. And hence, they are

 referred to as the *āyatana*s (Visuddhi. 2:112).

_Attano sebhāvum dhāretīti dhammo_ = because they their own specific characters, they are named the _dhamma_. This being so, since all the *paramattha dhamma*s bear their own specific characters (= the characters), they should be taken as a single “_dhammā-yatana_.” A question would then arise as to why it is expatiated as 12 *āyatana*s but

treating each separately. The answer follows.

This _āyatana desana_ is exhorted to clearly differentiate the doors and object of 9

the six kinds of _viññānakāya_ (tactile cognition). Since there are six *dvāra*s and six _āram- mana_ _āyatanas_, it was expounded as 12 *āyatana*s insteadūof a single _dhammāyatana_.

1. The door, at which all the _viññāna_ (cognition) included in the _cakkhuviññānavīthi_ (eye consciousness process), is just the _cakkhāyatana_, and the _rûpārammana_ (visible object) is the only object domain.
1. The door, at which all the _viññāna_ (cognition) included in the _sotaviññānavīthi_ (ear consciousness process), is just the _sotāyatana_, and _saddārammana_ (acoustic object) is the only object domain.
1. The door, at which all the _viññāna_ (cognition) included in the _ghānaviññānavīthi_ (nose consciousness process), is just the _gandhārammana_ (olfactory object) is the only object domain.
1. The door, at which all the _viññāna_ (cognition) included in the _jivhāviññānavīthi_ (tongue consciousness process), is just the _rasārammana_ (taste object) is the only object domain.
1. The door, at which all the _viññāna_ (cognition) included in the _kāyaviññānavīthi_ (body consciousness process), is just the _phothabbārammana_ (tactile object) is the

6. The door is the plane where all the *viññāna*s* (cognition), which are included in the *manoviññānavīthi*, arise and part of the *āyatana* referred to as *bhavañgacitta\*

 arising after being vibrated twice.

(This is a translation with reference to Mahātīkā. According to speeches made by successive generations of teachers, the plane of formation of all the _viññānas_, included in the _manoviññānavīthi_, is just a part of the _āyatana_ referred to as _bhavañgacitta_ arising after vibrating twice. According to the Subcommentary (Tīkā), the _bhavañgaclana_ (vibration of life-continuum), which arises after vibrating twice, is the _manodvāra_. Generations of teachers have said that the vibrating _bhavañga_ = vibration of life-continuum = arising completely later = _bhavañgupaccheda_ (cessation of life-continuum) The only difference is the usage of _bhavañgacalana_ and _bhavañgupaccheda_. In essence, however, note that the main _desanā_ is the same. The vibrating _bhavañga_ = _bhavañga_-_calana_ by the power of which the _bhavañga_ distinctly arises, and _āvajjana_ can only arise when _bhavañga_ arises. _Ãvajjana_ will not arise when the _bhavañgacalana_ does not arise. With _bhavañga_ as the cause of _āvajjana_ in mind, the commentator has explained that _bhavañgacalana_ (= _bhavñgupaccheda_) referred to as _bhavañgamana_, which is a part of _āyatana_, is the plane of _dvāra_ where all the _viññāna_ included in the _manoviññānavīthi_ are

10

formed.) ū

**\*Ekadesayûpaca** - Lokiyasattaviññānadhātu manāyatanam* (*Visuddhi\* 2: 224).

It has been explained that all the seven _lokiviñūādhātu_, i.e., all the _lokīcitta_ (the object of insight knowledge) are _manāyatana_. Note that _bhavañga_ _citta_, which is a part of _manāyatana_, is taken by way of _ekadesayñpacāya_ as _manāyatana_, and again this _bhavañgamanāyatana_ as the _manodvāra_ the support of all _manoviññāna_.

**\*Dhammāyatana —** Tasampayuttā phassādayo sesarûpañca* “*dhammāyatanan*”*ti* (*Visud*- *dhi\* 2: 224). ūū

All *āyatana*s, except the _lokīviññānadhātu_ and _phassa_ etc. of 25 mind and mental concomitants occurring in each _cittakhana_ and _cakkhāyatana_ etc. of the above 10 _rûpā_- _yatana_, the remaining 16 *sukhumarûpa*s are the *dhammāyatana*s. These *dhammāyatana*s

are not associated either as _dvāra_ or object with _cakkhuviññāna_ etc. of the _pañcaviññāna_.

Another way of taking _Manodvāra_. “_Ayam nāma mano manādvāram na hotī_”_ti (Abhi. Tha._ 1: 129).

According to this commentary, the early _mana_ (= mind) is beneficial to the later _mana_ (mind). Therefore, all the early _mana_ can be taken as the causative _dvāra_ of the later ones. With reference to this commentary all the _citta_ called _manāyatana_ are _mano_-_dvāra_. Taking only the _bhavañga_ as the _manodvāra_ is routine way. Note that all the _citta_ as _manodvāra_ is by way of _pariyāya_. (A kind of _pariyāya_ refers to the _anantara_, the

proximate cause). ūūūūūūū

**_Dhammāyataūa also is a pariyāya_**. _Rûpāyatana_ etc. are usually (customarily) referred to as _rûpāyatana_. _Dhammāyatana_ and _dhammāramana_, however, are slightly different. As mentioned under _Dhammāyatana_ (see earlier pages of this vol.), _pasāda-rûpa_ (clear sensitivity), _sukhumarûpa_ (subtle forms), mind, mental concomitant, nibbāna and _paññatti_ (concept) are included in the phenomena called _dhammārammana_. Exhorta- tion has been made to selectively include the object of insight knowledge in the _dhammā_-_yatana_. But nibbāna and _paññatti_ cannot be included. The five clear sensitivity, which have been specially designated as _cakkhāyatana_ etc., cannot be included in the _dhammā_-_yatana._ Because all the *lokicitta*s have been given a special name _manāyatana_, they are not included in the _dhammāyatana_. Therefore, it must be noted that designating _dham_-_māyatana_ as _dhammārammana_ — the six _dvārayatana_, the six _ārammanāyatana_ — differentiating 12 *āyatana*s is because of a kind of _pariyāya_ (conditioned cause). (The _āyatana desanā_ was expounded for _rûpasammûlā_ and _majjimarûci_ individuals. See

section on _Rûpakammatthāna_). ū

[**Special Note**. Among the 16 subtle forms named _dhammāyata_ is also included the very important _hadayavatthurûpa_ (heart-based corporeality, which also is the _dham_- _māyatana_. This is a factor very important in concentrating on the 12 _āyatana_ objects and

the 18 element objects.]

Again, the six doors, the six objects and the six concepts, developed dependent upon the six objects of concentration, together come to 18 in all — the six each of the doors, the objects and the concepts. It should be noted that, as described in

11

_dhammāyatanū_, the _dhammadhātu_ is called _dhammārammana_.

CULTURING *RÛPA*ū— _NāMA_ BY WAY OF 18 ELEMENTS ū

In section on _Rûpakammatthāna_, the _cakkhudvāra_ = 54 kinds of visual sense (the eye), the true *rûpa*s have been described in tables. Among these 54
ūū

1.  1. Clear sensitivity is the visual element, but ūhe remaining 53 are not.

2) _Rûpārammana_ (visible object base) is the _rûpa_ element.
3) Depending on the _cakkhudhātu_, and taking the _rûpadhātu_ as the object, there

arises the mind which is the _cakkhuvññānadhātu_.

2.  1. _Sotapasāda_ (clear sensitivity of ear) is the _sotadhātu_ (sound element), but the remaining 53 are not.

2) _Saddārammana_ is the _saddādhātu_
3) The _citta_ (mind) which arises depending on and taking _saddahātu_ as the object, is the _sotaviññānadhātu_.

3.  1. _Ghānāpasāda_ (nose clear sensitivity) is the _gānadhātu_ (the scent element), but the remaining 53 are not.

2) _Gandārammana_ is the _gandadhātu_.
3) The _citta_ (mind) which arises depending on _ghānadhātu_ and taking the _gandārammana_ as the object, is the _ghānaviññānadhātu_.

4.  1. _Jivhāpasāda_ (tongue clear sensitivity) is the _jivādhātu_ (the scent element), but the remaining 53 are not.

2) _Rasārammana_ (_taste object)_ is the _rasadhātu_.
3) The _citta_ (mind) which arises depending on _jivhādhātu_ and taking _jivhārammana_ as the object, is the _jivhāviññānadhātu_.

5.  1. _Kāyapasāda_ (clear sensitivity of body) is the _kāyadhātu_ (the body element), but the remaining 53 are not.

2) _Pholabbārammana_ (_tactile object)_ is the _pholabbadhātu_ (tangible element).
3) The _citta_ (mind) which arises depending on *kāyadhātu*ūand taking _pholabba_ as the object, is the _kāyaviññānadhātu._

6.  1. _Pañcadvāvajjana_ - _sampatichannadve_ is the _manodhātu_.

2) The 52 _cetasika_ (mental concomitants) and 16 _sukhumarûpa_ (subtle material forms) are the _dhammadhātu_.
3) The _citta_ (mind) which arises depending _manodhātu_ and taking _dhammadhātu_ as

 the object, is the _manoviññānadhātu_.

[Note. As a good man the _manoviññānadhātu_, which can acquired at a _tihita_ (3-rooted condition) worldling stage, in your life-continuum are of the following kinds:

1. _Akusalacitta_ (karmically unwholesome consciousness) 12
1. _Santīranacitta_ (investigating consciousness) 3
1. _Manodvāravajjana_ (advertence) 1
1. _Mūhākusalacitta_ (great, wholesome consciousness) 8
1. _Mahāvipākacitta_ (result of great deed) 8
1. _Rûpāvacarajana_ (_kusala_) (fine material sphere consciousness) 4 (_catukka_ method) They all come to a total of 36 kinds.

12 ū

If raised to _rûpāvacara_ (world of forms) by way of _pañcaka_ (five-fold), there will be 37 kinds of _viññānadhatu_ (consciousness element). If all the eight _samāpatti_ (sus-

tained deep mental absorption) have been acquired, there will be 40 or 41 _viññānadhātu_.]

In this way the vaūious _dhātu_ (elements) are discerned to attain the visual knowledge of their ultimate truth:

1. _Cakkhudhātu, rûpadhātu, cakkhuviññānadhātu ,_
1. _Sotadhātu, saddadhātu, sotaviññānadhātu,_
1. _Ghānadhātu, gandhadhātu, ghānaviññānadhātu ,_
1. _Jivhādhātu, rasadhātu, jivhāviññānadhātu,_
1. _Kāyadhātu, pholabbadhātu, kāyaviññānadhātu,_
1. _Manodhātu,ūdhammadhātu, manoviññānadhātu_. (Note that it is not citation _kammatthāna_).

DISCERN THE _RÛPA_ - _NāMA_ ū

When you are able to concentrate on and take up the rûpa and nāma by your

knowledge as ūūū

1. _Cakkhudhātu, rûpadhātu, sotadhātu, saddādhātu, ghānadhātu, gandhadhātu, jivhādhātu,_ the 16 _sukhumarûpa_ (a part of _dhammadhātu_), called the _dhammadhātu_, are the *rûpadhamma*s.
1. _Cakkhuviññānadhātu, sotaviññānadhātu_ -------------- _manoviññānadhātu,_ the (52) mind and mental concomitants, called the *dhammadhātu*s, are the _nāma-_

 _dhamma_. ū

In this way tūke up and discern the _rûpa_ and *nāma dhamma*s (_Visuddhi_ 2: 224).

DISCERNING _RÛPA - NāMA_ BY WAY OF 12 *ÃYATANA*S

 A ū1. _Cakkhupasāda_ iū the _cakhāyatana_.

\2. _Rûpārammana_ is the _rûpāyatana._

 B 1. _Sotapasāda_ is the _sotāyatana_.

\2. _Saddārammana_ is the _saddāyatana_.

C. 1. _Ghanapasāda_ is the _ghānāyatana_.

\2. _Gadhāyatana_ is the _gandhāyatana_.

4.  1. _Jivhārammmana_ is the _jivhāyatana_.

\2. _Rasārammana_ is the _rasāyatana_.

5.  1. _Kāyapasāda_ is the _kāyāyatana_.

\2. _Pholabbāyatana_ is the _pholabbāyatana_.

6.  1. The seven _lokāviññādhātu_ is the _manāyatana_.

\2. the 52 mind and mental concomitants, the _dhammārammana_ called the 16 subtle

 material forms are the _dhammāyatana_.

13 ū

The _cakkhāyatana-rñpāyatana,_ the _sotāyatana-saddāyatana,_ the _ghānāyatana- gandhāyatana,_ the _jivhāyatana-rasāyatana,_ the _kāyāyatana-pholabbāyatana,_ the _dhammāyatana_, called the\* 16 subtle material forms, are all **_rûpadhamma_**.

The _manāyatana_ and _dhammāyatan_ (called the 52 _cetasika_) are all **_nāmadham-_**

**_ma_**. ūū

In this way concentrate on the _rûpa-nāma_ and discern the _rûpa-nāma_ (_Visuddhi_ 2: 224 - 225). ū

Here too it is important that the _kammatthāna_ is not a citation. One has to understand that the instruction is made to concentrate on these *āyatana*s as object to attain the ultimate truth via perfect knowledge (insight knowledge). The method is to combine the 18 *dhātu*s and the 12 *āyatana*s and to discern on the sum total of these. The discernment analytically of these into finer details is given in Mûlapannasa Commentary as follows. They are the ways of discerning the four *āyatana*s and the four *dhātu*s that arise at every _vīthicittakhana_ (mental process moment) along the course of _cittaniyāma_ (mental certainty).

 **A WAY OF DISCERNūNG _DūāTU_ — _āYATANA_** ūū

_Tatthā cakkhu cakkhāyatanam, rûpam rûpāyatanam, dassanam manāyatana vedanādayo sampayuttadhammā dhammāyatanam. Evametesam catunnam āyatanānam samavāye ālokanavilokanam paññāyati. Tattha ko eko āloketi, ko viloketi. Tathā cakkhu cakkhu-dhātu, rûpam rûpadhātu, dassanam cakkhuviññānadhātu, tamsampayuttā vedanādayo dhammadhātu. Evametāsam cakkhunnam dhātunam samavāye ālokanavikkanam_

_paññāyati. Tatthako eko āloketi, ko viloketi_ (_Ma-Ttha._ 1: 268).

If the following four *āyatana*s happen to come together there occurs the state of looking straight and looking askance.

1. Eye clear element is the eye base\*
1. Visible object is the visible object base
1. Visualizing visual concept is the mind base
1. The associated mind and mental concomitant _sampayutta dhamma_ groups, such as _phassa-vedanā-saññā-cetanā-ekaggatā-jīvita-manasikāra_, are the _dhammā-yatana_ (mental object base).

Now who would see this way? Which living being would look straight forward or askance? (It means there is neither straight forward looking nor looking askance ones).

A similarly situation holds true for the following.
ūū

1. _Cakkhupasāda_ (the eye sensitivity) is the _cakkhudhātu_ (the element of vision)
1. _Rûpārammana_ (the visible object base)* is the *rûpadhātu* (the mental element)*.\*
1. Realizing _cakkhuviññāna_ (the eye consciousness) is the _cakkhuviññānadhātu_ (the eye consciousness element).
1. The associated mental concomitants, such as _phassa_ etc., the _phassasampayutta_- _dhamma_ (associated tangible factors) are _dhammadhātu_ (mind element).

(_Ma.Ttha_.1: 261).

14

The opening of these documentaries explained in such a way that the manifes- tations become vividly materialized using the _upalakkhanā_ and _nidassana_ methods. ū

Now you good man, discern the _nāmakammatthāna_ tables again. Pay attention to them as the object of concentration. Pay attention on the corporeality and mentality once again. In the above commentary it is explained that the four *āyatana*s and the four *dhātu*s are realized as the _rûpārammana_ at the instance of the _cittaviññāna_ (mental

consciousness) _cittakkhana_ (thought moment).

The mental consciousness cannot arise without _pañcadvāravajjana_ (apprehension through the five sense doors) arising before it. If it is the _cakkhuviññāna_ (eye consciousness), a series of thought processes do not halt during the interval of _cakkhuviññāna_, or of _sampaticchana_, nor _santīrana_. It will continue at least up to _vuttho_ (determining consciousness). Even then, the _ārammana_ has to be weak _parittārammana_ for it to halt the mental processes and come to a _bhavañga_ (rapt.). If the _ārammana_ (the object) is the _mahantarāramma_, it is usual to continue up to the attainment of _jo_ (impulsion), if _atirām mana_ up to _tadārammana_ (registering).

Therefore at a consciousness moment of _cakkhuviññāna_, the four *āyatana*s and the four *dhātu*s are formed, so also at the _pañcadvāravajjana, sampticchana, santīrana_, _uttho, tadārammana_ etc., there are four *āyatana*s and four *dhātu*s respectively. A few examples will be cited here. At each thought moment, there will be four *āyatana*s and

four *dhātu*s respectively, where —
ūū

1. Supporting heart-based corporeality is the _dhammāyatana_ (mental object).
1. _Rûpārammana_ (visible object) is the _rûpāyatana_ (visible object base).
1. _Pañcadvārāvajjana citta_ (conscious mind through the five sense doors) is the _manāyatana_ (mind-based sense).
1. The associated mental concomitant _sampayutta_ (association) groups are _dhammā_- _yatana_ (mental base).
1. The supporting heart-based corporeality is the _dhammadhātu._
1. The visible object is the _dhammadhātu_.
1. The _pañcadvārāvajjana citta_ is the _manodhāma_.
1. The associated mental concomitant _sampayutta_ groups are _dhammadhātu_.

 However, the heart-based corporeality and associated mental concomitant _dhamma_ groups are both the _dhammadhātu_. If such similar *dhamma*s are combined, there will be three *āyatana*s and three *dhātu*s. Note that this hold true for the remaining thought processes (_vīthicitta_). Whether small or large in numbers, all the associated mental

concomitant *sampayutta dhamma*s are the _dhammāyatana_ and _dhammadhātu_ only.

There still remain some distinct cases. For example, though _sampaticchana_ is named _manāyatana_ (the mental object base), but as an element it is _manodhātu_ (the mental element). It is not nominated as _manoviññānadhātu_. Note that the remaining thought processes are _manoāyatana_ as well as _manoviññānadhātu_. For those still with immature knowledge the _jocittakhana_ (moment of consciousness impulsion) , which includes _nāmadhamma_, is given as an illustration.

15

In each and every _jocittakhanā_ (character of consciousness impulsion), under- stand the four _āyatana_
ūū

1. The supporting heart-base corporeality is the _dhammāyatana_ (= _dhammadhātu_).
1. The _rûpārammana_ is the _rûpāyatana_.
1. The _kusalajoviññāna_ (meritorious consciousness impulsion) is the _manāyatana_ (= _manoviññānadhātu_).
1. The associated mental concomitant, the (33) association _dhamma_ groups are the

 _dhammāyatana_ (= _dhammadhātu_).

In other words, if the heart-base corporeality and mental concomitant _dhamma_ are combined as they have similar ātatana, there will be three *āyatana*s and three *dhātu*s. In this way concentrate on the four *āyatana*s and the four *dhātu*s at every thought process moment. Discern on all the good and bad groups in accordance with process series. Contemplate covering all the six lines. Concentrate on row after row given in the _Ñāmakammattha_ tables. When one is able to also discern _patisandhe-bhavañga-cuti_,

continue in a similar way as above. ū

If one wants to discern another way, after successfully concentrating on the four *āyatan*s and the four *dhatu*s at every thought moment as mentioned above, one may culture the whole row through and through. Lest use see the first row (good group table) of line showing the _rûpārammana_ of the good group table. Here, there are _pañcadvārāvajjana, cakkhuviññāna, sampticchana, santīrana, vuttho_, seven impulsions, two _tadārammana_ — _manodvārāvajjana_, seven impulsions, two _tadārāmmana_

respectively. The at every thought process moment, discern as given below.
ūūū

1. The supporting heart base corporeality as object concentrate as _dhammāyatana_, _cakkhāyatana, dhammāyatana, dhammāyatana_ .....
2. Taking rûpārammana as object concentrate as _rûpāyatana, rûpāyatana,_ .....
3. Taking each consciousne mind as object collect as _manāyatana_, _manāyatana_.
4. Taking the associated mental concomitant _sampayutta dhamma_ groups as object,

 concentrate as _dhammāyatana_, _dhammāyatana_.

In this way collect each row four times. ū

In supporting corporeality, all the _cakkhuviññāna dhamma_ groups are upon _cak_- _khuvutthurûpa_ (visual corporeality). All the remaining thought processes arise dependent upon the heart base corporeality called the _dhammāyatana_ and _dhamma-dhātu_. So note that in the supporting corporeality, the *dhammāyatana*s are for the remaining thought processes, and the _cakkāyatana_ is for the _cakkhuviññāna_. In con-

tinuation, a hint on collection by the 18 _dhātu_ way will be described.
ūūū

1. Taking the supporting corporeality as the only object discern as _dhammadhātu, dhammadhātu, dhammadhātu, dhammadhātu_ ....
2. The _ārāmmanarûpa_ only is taken as the object and discern as _rûpadhātu, rûpa-dhāru_ ....
3. Taking each conscious mind as the object discern as _manodhātu, cakkhuviññāna- dhātu, manodhātu, manoviññānadhātu_.

16

4. The associated mental concomitant _sampayutta dhamma_ groups are taken as the object and discerned as _dhammadhātu, dhammadhātu_ .....

The above 1 - 4 belong to the eye door thought process and mind door thought

process.

The _pañcadvārāvajjana_ and _samptaticchana_ are the _manodhātu, cakkhuviññāna_ is the _cakkhuviññāna dhātu_, and the remaining thought processes are the _cakkhuviññāna dhātu_. In contemplating on the _cetasika_, each is taken with reference to its associated _cetasika_ arising at each thought moment, and collectively taken as the _dhammāyatana_ or

the _dhammadhātu_. ū

Collect all the bad and good groups in each row in the line showing _rûpārammana_. Discern in the _saddārammana_, etc. in a similar way. In this method the discernment on

both _āyatana_ and _dhātu_ phenomena are the same. ūū

Reside singly in _arañña_ (in the forest), _rukkhāmûla_ (under a tree), _suññāgāra_ (in a quiet place) happily, as the Lord has instructed. With the mind set at the nibbāna with _appamādadhamma_ (mindfulness) called the vigilance on the object _rûpanāmadhamma sañkhāra_, a vigorous concentration is to be made with unyielding zest and zeal.

Now collection of the five-fold corporeality will be described. To begin with, _khandhā_ (corporeality) and _upādānakkhandhā_ (the five clinging aggregate) will be presented. **EXTRACTS FROM KHANDHā-SUTTANA**

The _rûpa_ dhamma (corporeality phenomena) of the past, future and present, all those that are internal and external, all those that are coarse and subtle, all those that are low and lofty, all those that are far (from the consciousness of the meditator) and near (close to the consciousness of the meditator). All these (11) categories of material forms are the _rûpakkhandhā_ (the aggregate of the matter or of corporeality).
1. R. All the _vedanā dhamma_ (phenomena of suffering) are the _vedanakkhandhā_ (aggregate of sensation or feeling group).
1. R. All the _saññā dhamma_ (phenomena of perception) are the _saññakkhandhā_ (the aggregate of mental formation or perception group).
1. R. all the _cetasika sankhāra dhamma_ (mental formation phenomena) are _sankhā- ranakkhandhā_ (aggregate of mental formation).
1. All the _viññāna dhamma_ (consciousness factor) of the past, future and present, all those that are internal and external, all those that are coarse and subtle, all those that are low and lofty, all those that are far and near. All these (11) categories of

Bhikkhus .... These are the five-fold *khandhā*s

Bhikkhus .... Whaū are the five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_? There are such *dhamma*s as

6.  1. All theū*rûpa* phenomena of the past, future and the present, to which are attached as “I, mine” by _tahnā, ditthi_ and which are the object of the four _āsava dhamma_ (moral intoxicants), all those that are internal and external, all those that are coarse and subtle, all those that are low and lofty, all those that are far (from consciousness) and near (to consciousness). All these physical phenomena are

 the _rûpupādānakkhandhā_ (the aggregate as the object of grasping), existing as (11)

categories, and attached as “I, mine” by means of _tahnā, ditthi,_ the object of

 the four immoral intoxicants.

2. R. All the _vedanā dhamma_ are the _vedanupādānakkhandhā_ (clinging to the aggregate of sensation).
3. R. All the _saññā dhamma_ are the _saññupādānakkhandhā_ (clinging to the aggregate of perception).
4. R. All the _cetasika sañkhāra_ dhammas are the _sankārupādānakkhandhā_ (clinging to the aggregate of formation).
5. R. All the _viññāna dhamma_ (concept phenomena) are the _viññānupādānakkhandhā_

 (clinging to the aggregate of sensation) (_Sam_.-2:39, _Khandha-suttana_)

**_KHANDHā_ AND _UPāDāNAKKHANDHā_**

**(THE AGGūEGATES AND THE AGGREGATES AS OBJECT OF CLINGūNG)** ūūū

_Chatthe rûpakkhandho kāmāvacaro, cattāro khandhā catubhûmakā._ R. _Idhāpi rûpak-ūkhandho kāmāvacaro, avasesā tebhûmakā vipassanācāravasena vuttā. Evmettha rûpam rāsatthena khandhesu pavittham, sasavrāsatthena upādānakkhandhesu_. _Vedanādayo_

ūūū

1. In the five-fold _khandhā_, _rûpakkhandhā_ is the _kāmāvacara_ (the realms of sensual pleasures). The _vedanā-saññā-sankhāra-viññāna_, called the four-fold _nāmakkhandhā_ (the mental aggregate) are the _kāma-rûpa-arûpa-lokuttarā_ (the sensual existence-deva corporeal-formless existence), the *dhamma*s of the four _bhavana_ (planes) of existence. The first _Khandhādesanā_ was expounded to show that, whether in the mundane or supra-mundane, all the *dhamma*s that can be taken collectively as aggregates
1. In the _upādānakkhandhā,_ expounded as the second _desanā_, corporeal aggregate is the _kāmāvacara dhamma_. _Vedanā-saññā-sankāra-viññāna_, the four _nāmak-khandhā_, are those *tebhûmaka dhamma*s formed in the three planes of existence as _kāma-rûpa- arûpa_. The Buddha has to again expatiate the _upādānakkhandhā_ (the clinging aggregate) as the object of _vipassanañāna_ (insight knowledge)

 referred to as the _vipassanacāra_ (vipassanā exercise).

For a meditator still at the three-root plane of mundane mind and mental concomitant, called the _lokuttarakhandhā_ are the _dhamma_ he has not acquired yet. Therefore the _vipassanābhāvanā kammatthāna_, taking the lokuttarakhandhāas the object, cannot be made by analytical knowledge. But those who have acquired the _lokuttara_ _dhamma_ can. The _lokuttara_ mind and mental concomitant, however, the _sañkhata_

(results produced by specific action) _dhamma_ too. With reference to —

_Tīnimāni bhikhave sañkhatassa sañkhatalakkhanāni. Katamā tīni, uppādo paññāyatti, vayopañāyati, tthitassa aññatthattam paññāyati_ (_Am._ 1: 150).

the _sañkhata suttana desanā_, formation-static-dissolution = _upādā-tthī-bhañga_, there are definitely three _sañkhata_ (results produced by specific action) characters. Because of these three, they are also the _sañkhata_ *dhamma*s. They are the *dhamma*s dependent upon the phenomena of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of the _sañkhata_ _dhamma_ — arising only when supported by the forceful object of _upanissaya_ property of insight knowledge called _dhammaditthi_. Also when supported by the force of _ārammana paccaya_ (the object condition) of _asañkhata dhātu_ (the unconditioned and absolute element) only can these *dhamma*s arise. They are the *sañkhāra dhamma*s too. Therefore, it is true that they are

the _anicca, dukkha_ and *anatta dhamma*s.

Although these _lokuttarā citta-cetasika_ (the supra-mundane mind and mental concomitants) are the _sañkata_ and *sañkhāra dhamma*s included in the _anicca-dukkha-anatta dhamma_ groups, the *magga dhamma*s (the Path factors) are those that relieve one

 from the suffering of the rounds of rebirth = the good _niyānika_ (leading to salvation)

18 19 ū

*dhamma*s. The _phala_ (Fruit) *dhamma*s are also the good causes definitely leading to enjoyment of the _santisukha_ of the _nibbāna_ = the great peacefulness. Therefore the discernment on these _lokuttarā citta_ and _cetasika_ by _vipassanā_ as _anicca-dukkha-anatta_ are not meant to become wearied of worldly life by _nibbinda ñāna_ (knowledge of tedium) But when the vipassanā exercise is made taking as object only on the _lokī citta-cetasika_-_rûpa_, recognized as the causes for suffering of the *sansār*ic circus, then the nature of _citta-cetasika_ will vividly be understood. Then the _nibbinda ñāna_, which become entirely tedious of the five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_, referred to as the suffering of the *sansār*ic circus, will arise. That is why only the *lokī khandhā*s (mundane aggrgate) taken as object in exercising _vipassanākammatthāna_. With a view to contemplate in this way,

the Buddha hūs to admonish _upādānakkhandhā desanā_ solely of the *lokī khandhā*s.

Since the _rûpa dhamma_ means aggregate, it is also included in the *khandhā*s. It also bears the meaning of aggregate as the object of _āsava_ (canker, fetter) *dhamma*s,

hence it is included in the *upādānakkhandhā*s too.

The four-fold *nāma khandhā*s, such as _vedanā_ (feeling) etc., are the *khandhā*s that are the object of the *āsava dhamma*s. There are those *khandhā*s which are not the object of the *āsava dhamma*s. The _lokī citta-cetasika_ included in this four-fold *khandhā*s are

the object of *āsava dhamma*s, but _lokuttarā citta-ūetasiūa_ are not.

Included in the three planes of life, _kāma-rûpa-arûpa_, are the _lokī citta-cetasika- vedanā-saññā-sañkhāra-viññāna_. These are included in _upādānakkhandhā_ because it

bears the meaning of being the obūect of _āsava dhammas_.

The of the _lokī citta-ūetasika-rûūa_ included in the three planes of life —

1. The 28 species of _rûpa_ areū*rûpupādānakkhandhā*.
1. _Vedanācetasika_ is the _vedanupādānakkhandhā_.
1. _Saññācetasika_ is the _saññûpānakkhandhā_.
1. The remaining (50) *cetasika*s are all _vedanupādhānakkhandhā_. ūū

[N.B. To make it easier, the five-fold upādānakkhandhā are sometimes expressed as the _rûpakkhandhā, vedanā-kkhandhā, saññā-kkhandhā, sañkhārakkhandhā_ and _viññānak- khandhā_, or _rûpa_-_vedanā-saññā, sañkhāra-viññāna_ respectively. When you come acroos such usage, note that they all refer to the *upādānakkhandhā*s, the object of vipassanā meditation. In the _viññānakkhandhā_ is mentioned _lokīcitta_. These *lokīcitta*s, however, refer only to those that can arise in one’s *santāna*s (life continuum). Note also that the

cetasika refersūto those associated with the corresponding *citta*s.]

DISCERū *NāMA-RÛPA*ūSEPARATELY ūū

_Iti rûpakūhandho rûpam, cattāro arûpno khaūdhā nāmanti evameko pañcakkhandhavasena nāmarûpam vavatthapeti_ (_Visuddhi_ 2: 225).

Disceūn _rûpa_ and _nāma_ sūparately as “_rûpadhamma_ and _nāmadhamma_ as follows

1. _Rûpakkhandhā_ is the _rûpadhamma_.
1. The four-fold _nāma khandhā_ is the _nāmadhamma_

20 ūū

This is the way the _rûpa-nāma_ are discerned by method of the five-fold *khandhā*s. This is the way all the *rûpadhamma*s and *lokī nāma khandhā*s are collectively

concenūrated ūpon.

1. _Arûpasammûlhā_ = he who lacks clear consciousness on the _nāmadhamma_.\*
1. _Samkhittaruci_ = he who enjoys any thing concise.
1. _Tikkhapaññāvā_ = intelligent and sharp-minded person

With reference to the above three kinds of person, the Buddha has to expound the vipassanā meditation by method of _khandhā desanā_.

Discerning collectively in this way can be accomplished only by sharp-minded person. The following meditation method is given for slow-minded persons.

DISCERNING IN DETAIL — ūHE FIVEūFOLD _KHANDHā_ METHOD

_Ittha hi cakkhu ceva rûpañca rûpakkhandho, dassanam viññānā-kkhandho, tam-sampayuuta vedanā vedanā-kkhandho, saññā saññā-kkhandho, phassādikā sañkhārakkhando_. _Evametesam pañcannam khandhānam sammavāye ālokanavilokanam_

_paññāyati_. _Tattha ko eko āloketi, ko viloketi_ (*Ma.-Ttha.-*1: 267 - 268).

In the _pañcadvāravīthi_ (the fūve-door consciousnessūprocess) at a thought moment of consciousness by way of sight, the straight visualization and visualization at a glance vividly appear when the five-fold corporeality are captured together as

1. The eye clear element and _rûpārammana_ are the _rûpakkhanda_ (aggregate of matter),
1. The consciousness by way of sight, having visual capability, is the aggregate of consciousness,
1. The _vedanā_ (suffering) associated with the aggregate of consciousness is the aggregate of sensation or feeling group.,
1. The perception is the aggregate of perception,
1. The contact etc., of the five-fold mind and mental concomitant are the aggregate

of mental formation.

 Now which individual would have straight visualization and which one has

glancing ability? (What it means is that there is neither any individual of straight visualization nor glancing, it is only the phenomenon of the five-fold aggregate coming

together.)

As explained in many places above, the consciousness by way of sight cannot arise without the _pañcadvāravajjana_ (apprehension through the five sense doors), nor _sampaticchana, santirana, vuttho_, nor impulsion if it is _mahantārammana_, nor the impulsion- _tadārammana_ (the then object) if it is _atimahntārammana_. Because of this, the five-fold aggregate as the object of concentration, at the thought moment of consciousness by way of sight, has been indicated by the Commentator. Note that it is described as an instruction made via _upalakkhana_ (way of distinguishing) and _nidassana_ (compartive way). Therefore, the five-fold aggregate is taken as the object of meditation

on consciousness by way of sight, so also is it in the following.

21

1. The five-fold aggregate in _pañcadvārāvajjana_,
1. The five-fold aggregate in _sampaticchana_,
1. The five-fold aggregate in _santīrana_,
1. The five-fold aggregate in _vuttho,_
1. The five-fold aggregate in _javana_ (impulsion),
1. The five-fold aggregate in _tadārammana_,

Again in _manodvāravīthi_ (in *manodvāravīthi*s that follows)

1. The five-fold aggregate in _manodvārawajjana_,
1. The five-fold aggregate in each _javana_,
1. The five-fold aggregate in each *tadārammana*s,

 Note that it is the same in cases of _sotadvāravīthi_ etc.

A GOOD DISCIPLINE ū

In meditationūon _rûpa-nāma_ by way of the five-fold _khandhā_, practice along the rows have been found to have a clearer consciousness. Refer back to the good groups

along the _rûpārammana_ rows in the table of _Kammatthāna_. Take _cakkhu-dvāravīthi_ and _manodvāravīthi_ (eye-door thought process and mind-door thought process), influenced

by _mahākusala_ (great moral) impulsion, which occupy the ūirst row of the table as an example. The concentration is made described below. ūū

1. The 54 species of corporeality as object together with _rûpārammana_ of each and every _cittakhana_ (thought moment) in the _cakkhudvāravīthi_ and _manodvāravīthi_ are understood by wisdom as **_rûpa_**, **_rûpa_** ……..
1. Every _vedanā_ (suffering) associated with each _cittakhana_ are taken as object and understood by wisdom as **\*vedanā**, **vedanā\*** ….
1. Every _saññā_ (perception) associated with each _cittakhana_ are taken as object and understood by wisdom as **_saññā_,** **_saññā_** ….
1. All *cetasika*s (mental concomitants), other than _vedanā-saññā_, are taken together as object and understood by wisdom as **_sañkhāra_,** **_sañkhāra_** ….
1. Every _citta_ (consciousness) associated with each _cittakhana_ are taken as object

 and understood by wisūom as **_viññāna_,** **_viññāna_** ….

The good and bad groups in _rûpārammana_ are meditated in similar ways. Note that the same applies to those along the _saddārammana_ (sound base).

22

WHAT TO CONCENTRATE UPON WHEN UNDERSTOOD

If you have successfully practiced up to stage mentioned above, you should be able to answer the question. ūf not, the answer follows. ūū

 At every thought moment of _manodvāravīthi_, that* continue taking as object *cakkhudvāravīthi rûpārammana* that appears while discerning on the *rûpārammana*, the ultimate truth and *dhātu* essence of the *rûpa-nāma\* should be understood by

wisdom as follows.

1. **Four each of _āyatana_** according to _āyatana desanā_ ways.
1. **Four each of _dhātu_** according to _dhātu desanā_ ways.
1. **Five each of _khandhā_** according to _khandhā desanā_ ways. ū

Now this is the answer to the above query. This answer is just made refering to _nāma- rûpapariccheda ñāna_ (insight knowledge of mind and matter)* = *ditthivisuddhi\* (purifica-

tion of views).

 Suppose you have come up to _paccayapariggaha ñāna_ (knowledge of discerning the cause and result), you must discern the cause and result at every thought moment.

(This will be appreciated well in section on Paticcasamppāda).

A meditator ultimate reality of every individual of the ultimate element of the five- fold aggregate, by way of _lakkhana-rasa-paccupatthāna_-_padatthāna_, at individual thought moment of the _cakkhudvāravīthi_ and _manodvāravīthi_ , when he has come up to Lakkhanādicatukka. (This will be clear in section on Lakkhanādicatukka).

Again, if the meditator has attained the stage of _viappsanā_ he will have to concentrate on the three general characters, _anicca-dukkha-anatta_, of the **\*khandhā**, **āyatana\*** and **_dhātu_**, which are present at every thought moment of the _cakkhudvāravīthi_ and _manodvāravīthi_. (This will be clear in section on Vipassanā). It is the same in the

case of concentration on sound.

All these are instructions of the Pāli-Atthakathā-Tīkā indicating how, when and what to discern regarding the _paramatta_ elements while at seeing and hearing stages.

For the meditators who are searching for the true *dhamma*s of the Buddha the Sabbaññuta Sammāsambuddha, those who are willing to penetratively understand, even in this existence, _asankhatadhātu_, the element of peacefulness leading to the Path and the Fruit, those who are eager to be delivered from the _apāya_ (miserable existences), those who are willing to be relieved entirely of the miserable ageing, death and decay, these are

the instructions to take to heart, follow carefully and obediently.

HE WHO DEFIES ABHIDHAMMā

_Abhidhammam patibāhunto imassamin jinacakke pahāram deti, sabbaññutaññānam patibāhati, satthu vesārijjañānam patinivatteti, sotumākam parisam visamvādeti, ariya- magge āvaranam bandhati_. _Atthārasasu bhedakaravatthusu ekassamin sandissati, ukkhepanīyakammakijjanīyakammāraho hoti_. _Tam tam lammam katvā uyojetabbo “gaccha vighāsādo hutvā jīvissatī”ti_ (_Abhi.-Ttha_.-1: 30).

23 ū

The above descriptions in the Atthakathā are a warning to those who deny that the Abhidhammā is not admonished by the Buddha, and to those who are under the impression that the _vipassanā_ exercise need not be made on the ultimate truth of _rûpa_ and _nāma_, called the _khandhā_, _āyatana_ and _dhātu_, as instructed in the Abhidhammā. What it

really means is as follows. ūū

One who rejects the fact that Abhidhammā is Buddha’s expatiation and hinders it, and that the _rûpa_ and _nāma_, called the truth of _khandhā_, _āyatana_, and _dhātu_, that have been expounded in the Abhidhammā should not and need not be meditated, is in fact hindering and deviating from the Buddha’s noble _sāsanā_. He is preventing the Buddha’s _sabbaññnuta ñāna_ knowledge of Omniscience. He lets down the Buddha’s brave _vesārajja ñāna_ (the brave knowledge of perfect self-confidence). He misleads those who are willing to listen to and practice the Abhidhamma dhamma (= _rûpa-nāma_ in Abhi-dhammā are not concerned with *sāvaka*s but are for Sabbaññ Sammāsambuddha and the *Arahant*s—those who are willing to listen to the Abhidhammā are misled in this way to an erroneous concept). It is the same as blocking the Path leading attain nobleness; it is one of distinct the factors that causes that brought about dissention among the Sanghā

 called _bhedakara_ (causing disunion in the Sanghā). ū

That _Mahāthera_ should neglected from daily affairs by the Sanghā and to relieve him from the Buddhist order = an act of _upakkhepaniyakam_. He should be censured by Sanghā by way of _tajjniyakam_. [What it means is: the argument that Buddhabhāsita (Buddha’s utterances) Abhidhamma is not the Buddhabhāsita is referred to as _vivāda_ (contention). “The Buddha Abhidhammā would not bestow any benefit on human beings, the *sāvaka*s cannot meditate on the ultimate truth of the _rûpa_ and _nāma_, how could any one concen-trate on these hundreds of millions of *nāma dhamma*s which would have arisen and perished away within a blinking moment.” The demerit of the Abhidhamma are again indicated in this way. Now the argument on the Abhidhammā from negative side means committing _dhamma avannabhāsana_ (speaking bad of

dhamma). The _ukkhepaniyakam_ as well as _tajjaniya_ action should be taken on him.].

By taking these actions he should be sent off ordering him “Eater of others’ remainder—Make your living as a pauper.” (_Abhi.-Tha_.-1: 30).

Gentlemen, if you are willing to attain nibbāna, be careful not criticize the Abhidhamma without reason and be obedient to the warnings contained in the above Atthakathā.

**THE ūOUR-FOLD _VESāRAJJA ÑāNA_**

Bhikkhûs …. The Buddha’s brave knowledge called _vesārajja ñāna_ are of four-fold. The Lord fully endowed with these *vesārajja ñāna*s has declared himself to be the highest and possessed of sabbaññuta ñāna. He possesses self-confidence in preaching of the way leading to salvation to the people. He sets into Motion the Wheel of Truth.

These four are as follows. ū

1. The Buddha who declares himself to have penetratively realized, without any one’s help, by _sayambhû ñāna_ (self-dependent knowledge) and to be the Sammāsambuddha (the perfectly enlightened one), said “I have acquired peace

24

and tranquility, freedom and bravery, because no one, be a _sāmana_, a _byamana_, a _devā_, a _māra_, in this world can argue as there still are *dhamma*s that I have not realized.”

2. To the Buddha, who has declared himself to be a _khināsava_ (one whose mind is free from the mental obsessions), in whom all the _āsava dhammas_ have been extinguished
    1. an _Arahant_, it has been asserted as “such and such _āsava_ still remained to be extinguished.” I have not come across any _nimitta_ (sign), in either _samana_, or _byamana_, or _deva_, or _māra_ or any one in this world, who could have the right reason to indicate so. For this reason I have attained the peace and tranquility, freedom and bravery.
3. “The* assertion that the *dhamma*s that I have admonished are impediment to *jāna- magga-phala* is, in fact, not so to those who practice these *dhamma*s.” I have not encountered any *nimitta* in either the *samana*, or *byamana*, or *deva*, or *māra\* or any one in this world, who could have the right reason to indicate so. For this reason I have come to acquire the peace and tranquility, freedom and bravery.
4. “The indications that the *dhamma*s that I have given for purpose of cessation of the suffering from the rounds of rebirth, in fact, cannot afford deliverance to any one practicing on these *dhamma*s.” I have not encountered any _nimitta_ in either the _samana_, or _byamana_, or _deva_, or _māra_ or any one in this world, who could have the right reason to indicate so. For this reason I have come to acquire the

 peace and tranquility, freedom and bravery.

Bikkhus ---- These are the 4-fold _vesārajja nanas_ causing bravery. The Buddha, endowed with these _vesārajja nanas_ and admitting to possess _sabbaññuta ñāna_, delivered the *dhamma*s bravely and set the wheel of _dhamma_ into motion (_Am_.-1: 315. _Vesārajja-Suttana_).

Of these four-fold _vesārajja ñāna_, pay a careful attention to the fourth _vesārajja ñāna_. ū

As has been repeatedly explained previously—in Salāyatanavagga Samyutta Pāli Aparijānana-Suttana that if the _rûpa_ and _nāma dhamma_ not completely understood analytically by means of the 3-fold pariñña paññā to attain the _magga_ and _phala_, there is

no way of liberating from the suffering of sansāric circus (_Sam_.-2: 249 – 250). ūū

The eight noble *dhamma*s, called pubbbhāga satipatthāna magga preceding the _ariya magga_ (the Noble Path) have to be meditated, by the three-fold _pariññā paññā_ to analytically realize the _rûpa_ and _nāma_ so as to attain _magga_ and _phala_. The 8-fold magga, the noble practice, are the *niyyānika dhamma*s (sanctifying factors) leading to salvation. In other words, if these 8-fold *magga dhamma*s are practiced step by step, the _rûpa_ and _nāma_ are analytically realized by the 3-fold _pariñña paññā_ to have attained the _magga_ and _phala_. Such a realization itself is the _niyyānika dhamma_ delivering one from

the suffering of sansāric circus\* (the rounds of ūebirth). ū

Suppose you are under the impression that “the _rûpa_ and _nāma_ given in the Abhi- dhammā are not to be concentrated, but such and such phenomena, other than _rûpa_ and _nāma_, are to be concentrated in such and such a way.” With reference to such a person

the Atthasālini Atthakathā Sayādaw given an explanation.

25

“An individual who hinders the Abhidhammā is infact defying the noble dhamma called Buddha sasanā. He is reproving the _sabbaññuta ñāna_ of the Buddha. He is letting down the Buddha’s very brave _vesārajja nana_. He is misleading those gentle persons who are willing to listen to and to practice the good _dhamma_.” (_Abhi.-Ttha_.-1: 30).

**Even a learned can err sometime**.

**THE _ITTHāRAMMANA_-_ANITTHāRAMMANA_ CONCEPT**

\1. _Samāsana Vāda_ (Theory of Similar Concept)

To begin with, similar statements made by honorable teachers, called the _ūamāsana vāda_, is be presented.

The _ārammana_ (the object) that is unpleasant and should not be sought (_rûpa-vedanā- saññā-sankhāra_) is the anitthārammana. Whoever seeks that ārammana, in fact, it is the ārammana that should not be concentrated upon. It is the kind of ārammana that is not acceptable, unglamorous, not to be taken to heart, that is not conducive to _kusala_

_citta_ (meritorious mind).

In fact, it is completeness = far from pleasantness and hence an* unpleasant *āram- mana* that should not be accepted nor sought after. [The *Sampatti* here refers to *sampatti\* _bhava_ (blissful life) of sentient beings and *devā*s.]

In fact, the _anitthārammana_ (physically), among the _kamma_-produced corpo-reality, are the results of karmically unwholesome deeds. (These are the _vipāka nāma_

groups that have arisen from the _akusala kamma_ of _nāma dhamma_).

Because it not the cause for the _sukhavedanā_, this _ārammana_ should not be acceptable. Because it is not the true cause for the _sukhavedanā_ in the kind of _citta_ that is not conducive to mental faculty.

In this mind-produced corporeality, the five-fold _ārammana karmaguna_ (5-fold craving) produced by _akusala kamma_ are all _anitthārammana_. There is not such a thing as _anitthārammana_ in _kamma_-produced corporeality arising from _kusala kamma_. All the _kamma_-produced corporeality following the _kusala kamma_ are the _itthārammana_ (Abhi.- Ttha.-2: 8-9). ū

The arising of the _kamma_-produced _ittha-anittha_ is related to the sentient being bringing about that _kamma_-produced corporeality. If a living being has cultivated _akusala kamma_, then it will encounter an _anittārammana kamma_-produced corporeality. If it is the _kusala kamma_ that is cultivated, an _itthārammana kamma_-produced corporeality will be the result in due course. **_Tasmā kammajanam itthanitthatā kamma-kārakasatthassa vasena yojanārahā siya_**. (_Mûlatī_.-2: 8).

26

**A CUP OF PRICELESS MEDICINE**

The explanations given by this Atthakathā-tīkā are a priceless medicine for a gentle man. The encounter of various unpleasant _anitthārammana_ is the result of the cultivation of _akusala kamma_ in the past. One should not grumble by various sorts reasons as “It is because of something that it has occurred. If so, then you are committing

a great blunder referred to as _ayoniso manasikara_ (a purposeless attention).

When the _kusala kamma_ is still in force, then that _kamma_ will always be creating encounters with discontent _ārammana_ and the discontent sentient beings. Whenever the anitthārammana are encountered, and if they can be taken heart as “well, every body is the nmaker of his own future,” then in your _santāna_ (life-continuum) _yonisomanasikara_ ( a wise attention), the true basic causes of _kusala_, has made its appearance. If the three characters of anitthārammana are concentrated by vipassanā until their ultimate truth is acquired, then it is a kind of _yonisomanasikara_ which has attained the peak of _vipassanā_

_ñāna_ (insight knowleūge).

**AN EXPLANATION BY _MÛLATĪKā_**

 The above _atthakathā_ has explained—**_kusalakammajam anittham nāma natthi_** = as a rule, _kamma_-produced corporeality resulting from _kusala kamūa_ never is an _anitthā_- _rammana_. The explanation does not include **_Akusalakammajam nittham nāma natthi_** =

as a rule, _kamma_-produced corporeality resulting from _akusala kamma_ never is an _itthā_- _rammana_. Because of this situation, if _akusala kamma_-produced _rûpa_ happens to be pleasant (even though it is an _anitthārammana_ for you who have cultivated _akuso kamma_ beforehand), it may be _itthārammana_ for other sentient beings. Again other teachers are of the opinion that all the _kuso kamma_-produced corporealities are _itthārammana_ for both

self and others. ū

As a continuation further explanations will be given. Some sentient beings do not appreciate nor like the human features and his appearance. Because of this dislike they would run away from his presence. In the same way humans are frightened by the appearance and features of the *devā*s. Though the humans and sentient beings are scared away, the _cakkhuviññāna_ (visual perception) etc. of _vipākaviññāna_ (resultant perception) takes that corporeality as object (physical object) that has arisen in the _santāna_ of these frightened beings, appear as just the _kusalavipākaviññāna_. Similarly, in living beings scared of humans and humans scared of the *devā*s, these features as _ārammana_ cannot be pleasant because they lack the power resulting from good deed. This is the opinion of the some *kecisayā*s. (The idea of _kecisayā_’s is that all _kusala kamma_-produced corporealities are _itthāramman_. Those who do not have adequate power in their _santāna_ find these not charming when they come across these _itthārammana_. As the mûlatīkāsayādaw disagrees with these assertions, he has retorted as follows.)

The explanation of the _Atthakathā sayā_ is that the absence of _anitthārammana_ in all _kusala_ the _kamma_-produced corporeality as well as the absence of the pleasant _itthārammana_ in all the _akusalakamma-produced_ corporeality, is an apt explanation.

Indeed, the _kamma_-produced corporeality in the _santāna_ of the sentient beings, 27

like elephant etc. during the start of life, are the result of _akusala kamma_ performed during a certain past existence. The encounter by humans of the _akusala kamma_-produced corporeality of these beings, such as elephant etc., are the _akusalavipākacitta_ that appear due to taking these as object in their _santāna_. (It means _Pañcaviññāna-sam- paticcha-nasantīrana-tadārammana_).

When such beings as elephant etc. has grown into adult after growing gradually, called _pavatti_ (formative stage), however, after period of rebirth stage, (to become a _mangala hsin_ (lucky elephant) the _kuso kamma_-produced corporeality have the chance to make its appearance. (The elephant, before attaining an elephant’s life when _akusala_ *dhamma*s are cultivated to attain such a life on one hand, while on the other hand _kusala_ meritorious deeds, such as _dāna_ (alms-offering), were made so that both _kusala_ and _akusala_ are amix. If rebirth resultant occurs because _akusala_ has acquired more chance, the _kusala kamma_ result can also arise so that _pavatti_ results may occur in continuation. By the power of _kusala kamma_, which could produce _pavatti_ results, _kusala kamma_-

produced corporeality in the form of a white elephant etc. may make its appearance.)

By taking as object the _kusala kamma_-produced corporeality of sentient beings, such elephant etc., called _itthārammana_, which have gradually grown at the time of _pavatti_ period, _kusalavipākacitta_ can arise in humans. (_Pañcaviññāna-sampaticchana- santīrana-tadārammana-citta_ is meant here.)

The encounter by humans of _itthārammana_ is also related to their _kusala kamma_, but not to that sentient beings such as elephant etc. ūū

Although it is true that the _kamma_-produced corporeality of sentient beings such as elephants etc. can be an object of the human _kusalavipākaviññāna_, but in the santāna of the sentient beings can there be _itthārammana kamma_-derived corporeality as well as the _anitthārammana kamma_-derived corporeality. It means that as there can be _kusala kamma_- derived corporeality referred to as _itthārammana_, so can there be the akusala- kamma- produced corporeality, called the _initthāramma_. Therefore, the _itthārammana_ and _anitthārammana_ are mingled. In such a mingled state in the elephant etc., _anitthā_-_rammana rûpa_ called the _akusala kamma_-produced corporeality is only a minor case in the _santāna_ of it when maturity is attained at a time of _pavatti_ period. The _itthārammana_, the _kusala kamma_- derived corporeality (adequate enough to have attained the state of a _mangalā_ elephant) of the previous and present, however, is an overlapping major case. Therefore, however mingled the _itthārammana_ of _kusala kamma_-produced and _anitthā-rammana_ of _akusala kamma_-produced corporealities may be, the _akusala kamma_-produced _anitthārammana_, as a minority, cannot be the real cause for arising of the many _akusalvipākacitta_ in the _santāna_ of humans. Probably, it could be asserted this way. (In the _santāna_ of elephant etc., during the time of _pavatti_ period, only the _itthāramma_, which are the majority, is taken as object. In the _santāna_ of humans, concentrating on the _itthārammana_, _kusalavipākacitta_ has the chance to arise. For this reason, _akusala kamma_ produced-corporeality-_anitthārammana_ cannot be the cause for the appearance of the _akusalavipākacitta_ in the humans. This is what the whole idea is meant). (Mûlatī-2: 8).

**THE OUTSTANDING FRATURES OF THE TWO _VÃDA_**S\*\* ū

According to the _kecivāda_ the splendid material forms, arising in the sentient beings such elephants when they have gradually attained maturity, are only the _anitthā-rammana_ _rûpa akusala kamma_-produced corporeality due to their cultivation in the past

of the _akusalūkamma_. ūūū

According to Mûlatīkāsayādaw, the _patisandhe kammaja rūpa_ (_kamma_-produced rebiūth phenomena) of the elephant etc. are only the _akusala kamma_-produced _anitthā- rammana rûpa_. It has been exsaptiatedūthat the splendid *rûpa*s, whiūh appear at _pavatti_

period when maturity is attained, are the *kusokammajarûpa*s = the *itthārammana rûpa*s, which were cultivated in the past existence of these sentien beings. (That is to mean that the ugly and inferior *rûpa*s are the _akusalakammaja rûpas_. It is consistent with Añgutta- ranikāya Dassakanippātti Jānusoni-suttana. See _Am_. 3: 478 – 482).

**\*So tattha lābhī hotī**ti so tattha hatthiyoniyam nibbattopi mañgalahatthitthānam paūvā lābhī hoti*. (*Am.-Ttha.\* 3: 339).

In the _santāna_ ofūelephant etc., during pavūtti period, although thū _itthārammana rûpa_ ūūū

-   _akusalakammaja rûpa_ and _anitthārammana rûpa_ = _akusalakammaja rûpa_ are intermingled, the latter are infinitesimal, but *kusalakammaja rûpa*s are of considerable magnitude. Therefore, the Mûlatīkāsayādaw is of the opinion that such an infinitesimal *akusalakammaja rûpa*s cannot be the cause for the arising of _akusalavipākacitta_ in the _santāna_ of sentient beings like humans. The sayādaw once again expounded as given

below.

_Vipākūm pana kattaco na sakka vañcetunti vipākavasena itthānitthārammanava-vatthānam sutthu vuttam_. _Tasmā tam anugantvā sabbattha itthānitthatā yojetabbā._

 (_Mûlatī_- 2: 8). ūū

Again in whichever _ārammana_ it may be, the _vipākviññāna_ cannot be deceived. Because of this determination of _itthārammana_ or _anitthārammana_ by virtue of _vipākaviññāna_ (_Abhi.Ttha.-_ 2:10), as explained by Tipitakasûlābhayathera, has been mentioned in attakthā. Therefore, the determination _ittha_ and _anittha_ by power of that _vipākaviññāna_ only, the formation of _ittha_ and _anittha ārammana_ should be associated (Mûlatī.-2: 8).

Now this is the similarity of meaning by all the _atthakathā sayādaws_, the similar _attakathā_ = _samanavāda_.

_VITANTAVāDĪ VāDA_

SOPHISTRY

An individual who would make fallacious speech that could disheartened ūhe men of wisdom is the vitandavādī (a sophist). He would speak oout as

**\*Itthānittham** nāma pātiyekkam pativibattam natthi*, *tesam tesam rûcivasena kathitam\* (Abhi.-Ttha.-2: 9).

There is no such a thing a the _itthārammana_ and _anitthārammana_ which can be analyzed individually as a single item each. Determination of an _ārammana_ as either the

29

_itthārammana_ or the _anitthārammana_ is related to individual living being’s like or dislike of it (that _ārammana_). To the Great King Kosala the Buddha himself has admonished as follows.

-   The Great King …. Among the five-fold _kāmaguna ārammana_, I have indicated that

only the _ārammana_ that is attractive and the heart’s liking is the extreme determinant and is noble. The Great King …. Even that individual *årammana*s can be a heart stimula-ting for some, but not for the others. The Great King …. A single kind of sounds, smells, tastes and touches can be the balm to the heart of some, but not to that of others.” This what the Lord has expatiated in Sagāthā-vaggakosala-samyutta Pañcarāja-suttana (Sam.-

1: 80). ū

With reference to the method as indicated above, a single _rûpārammana, saddā_- _rammana, ganfhārammana, pholabbārammana_ etc. may be pleasant and attractive _ārammana_ for one, and cause the arising of clinging, attachment and _lobha_ (greed) to that _ārammana_. To the other these *ārammana*s could cause anger, a feeling of sorrow, and hate. These *ārammana*s themselves may be the attractive, pleasing and adorable *itthāramman*s for one. These may again be the disgusting, disagreeable and unadorable

*anitthārammana*s for the other.

The same *ārammana*s are taken by optimist as pleasing and adorable, on the other hand, they displeasing unadorable for a pessimist. Therefore, there no such a thing

as _ittārammana_ separate from _anitthārammana_ in its own entity.

In fact countrymen living in the extreme periphery _paccantavāthī_) of the Majjhimadesa (the Middle Region) would find even the earthworms to be _itthārammana_, _attractive_ and _adorable_. For those living right inside the Majjhimadesa, however, would find these earthworms to be _anitthārammana_, irritable and rejectable. Again the _paccan-tavāthī_, the countrymen, would find the meat of peacock to be irritable, inedible and unpleasant. This is the the way of thinking of vitantavādī with regard to itthārammana

and anitthārammana (Abhi.-Ttha.-2: 9).

THE REPLY

In response to the idea of _vitantavādī_, the _atthakathā_ has retored as follow. Ask the vitantavādī as

Do you mean there is no such a thing as _itthārammana_ and _anitthārammana_ in its entity to determine separately?

Suppose his answer was “_āma natthi_ = well, no, there is not.” Ask him the same question three times, and make him answer _āma natthi_ three times admittedly. After- wards give him a problem to see what his answer would be.

The question is “Is the _Nibbāna atta_ or _anatta_”? The _vitanta vādī_ might answer, through knowledge of his own, indeed nibbāna is the _itthārammana_.

He might remain silent, but in fact nibbāna is the _itthārammana_.

Some people are sensitive and become angry when the merits of the nibbāna are

30

mentioned, and would angrily answer as follow.

Well now you are talking about the merits and goodness of the _nibbāna_. I would like to ask you if there were adequate and various kinds of eatables, flowers, perfume, essence, cosmetics, clothings and place to sleep—the five-fold _kāmaguna ārammana_ in

the nibbāna?

The answer to question put by the _vitanda vādī_ would simply be “No.” If such an answer is given by _sakavādī_, a person whose idea is with the framework of the _sāsanā_, and in continuation the _vitanda vādī_ should be told: You would close your ears and say

“No. _Alam tava nibbānena_ = your nibbāna would be not advantageous.”

The great noble _nibbāna dhamma_ is indeed an _itthārammana_. Even though it is so, there are no five-fold *kāmaguna ārammana*s to enjoy, for which the _nibbāna_ when viewed from the _vitanda vādī_’s standpoint comes to be known as _anitthārammana_.

_Anitthārammana_ it may be for those who does not want, the great noble _nibbāna dhamma_ should not and must not be taken as _anitthārammana_. A person who implied the nibbāna to be anittha is one who possesses _viparitasaññā_ (altered perception) = wrong perception associated with the _lobha_ (greed) associated with the enjoyment of the five-fold *kāmaguna ārammana*s. Because of this wrong perception, he has asserted the

remark “Hold it. There is no benefit derivable from your nibbāna.”

Because of changes of perception = _vippanlāsa_ (transposition) alteration in the perception, an _ārammana_ may be _itthārammana_ for one who is in search of it. At the same time that _ārammana_ may be disagreeable and unacceptable for another (Abhi.-

Ttha.-2: 9 – 10).

Now these are the assertions in atthakathā made in response to that of the _vitanda_

_vādī_.

**_SAÑÑāVIPALLāSA_**

(**THE CONCEPT TRANSPOSITION**)

The perceptions associated with _lobha_ clinging to the *kāmaguna ārammana*s, which are not the true _ittha_, and believe them to be the _ittha_, the _nibbāna dhamma_ and other *ārammana*s which are wrongly taken to be the true _anitth_—the perceptions which here are said to be _viparitasaññā_ = perceptions subject to changes. That _viparitasaññā_ is again explained as _saññāvipallāsa_. Because of the _viparitasaññā_ the nibbāna, which lacks *kāmaguna ārammana*s inform of food and enjoyable substances, he simply honestly said “alam tava nibbānena = That is enough. There is no benfit in your nibbāna.” The majority of the present day persons wishing for “immediate attainment of _nibbāna_” are, infact, usually have one thing in mind and another in the mind. They want to acquire the nibbāna in no time. They, however, do not practice in the right way to attain the nibbāna following the right path. Having a heart of acquiring nibbāna, though they cannot

practice presently, should be said to have a great merit.

**THE THREE-FOLD _VIPALLāSA_** ū

**\*Vipallāsā**ti anicca-dukkha-anatūa-asubhesuyeva vatthûsu iccam sukhan attā subha”ti evum pavatto saññāvipallāso cittavipallāso ditthivipallāso ime tayo\* (Visuddhi-2: 324).

In the five-fold *upādānakkhandhā rûpa-nāma dhamma*s, which are the true _anicca, dukkha, anatta_ and _asubha_, in other words in the _dukkha-saccā_ and *samudaya-saccā dhamma*s, there are three-fold *vippllāsa*s:

1. Wrong perception as (a) _Nicca_, (b) _Sukha_, (c) _Atta_, (d) _Subha_ = _Saññāvipallāsa_
1. Wrong notion as (a) _Nicca_, (b) _Sukha_, (c) _Atta_, (d) _Subha_ = _Cittavipallāsa_
1. Wrong view as (a) _Nicca_, (b) _Sukha_, (c) _Atta_, (d) _Subha_ = _Ditthivipallāsa._

In this way there are three-fold *vippllāsa*s as _Saññāvipallāsa, Cittavipallāsa,_ and _Ditthivipallāsa._ There are four categories in each making it 12-fold of _vippllāsa_ *dham- ma*s (Visuddhi-2: 324).

Perceptions subject to change = _viparitasaññā_ arise because the *vippalāsa dhamma*s distinctly do exist from which no deliverance has been attained. Based on the _viparita saññā_, the living beings wrongly perceived _ittha_ as _anittha_ and vice versa. They are having wrong notions and wrong perceptions and these are, indeed, the _ayoniso manasikāra_ (the unwise attensions). There is every possibility that *akusala dhamma*s

could arise based on these _ayoniso maniasikāra_.\*

**DETERMINATION OF _IṭṭHāRAMMANA_ AND _ANIṭṭHāRAMMANA_ ACCORDING**

**INDIVIDUALS OF MEDIOCRE LIVING BEINGS**

_Iṭṭhānitthārammanam pana pātiyakkam vibhattam aṭṭhīti_. _Kassa vasena vibhattanti_? _Majjhimakasattassa_ (_Abhi.- ṭṭha_.-2: 10).

Determination of _iṭṭhārammana_ and _iniṭṭhārmmana_ is given in the _Aṭṭhakathā_. It is not ture that there never exist _iṭṭhārammana_ and _aniṭṭhārammaṇa_ as asserted by the _vitandavādī_. Then how is it determined which are _iṭṭhāramaṇa_ and which are _aniṭṭhārammaṇa_? The explanation in the Aṭṭhakathā is that it is made by virtue of wish a Mediocre person.

Further explanation. Determination of an _ārammaṇa_ as either _iṭṭha_ or _aniṭṭha_ should, however, be made by virtue of the great president, the King Mahāsudassanasak-kāya, King Dhammāsoka etc., who are of great power. Indeed, these powerful rulers, belonging to the higher strata, are not contended with nor appreciate an _ārammana_ like ordinary foods, of celestial origin, comparable to the five-fold _ārammana karmaguna_, though the food is an _itthāramman_. In their mind this _ārammana_ is taken to heart as not

appreciable nor stumlating to their heart.

For very poor, and of low strata, humans and sentient beings for whom getting a daily meal is hard effort, even the meal made broken rice, foul rice and curry would be

delicious and will be _ittha_ though it is indeed _anittha_.

In dertermining whūther an _ārammana_ is _ittha_ or _anittha_, it should be according to the middle class humans’ (Pāmokkha, Minister, rich man, merchant etc.) definition.

Therefore, good _rûpa-sadda-gandha-rasa-pholabba-dhamma_ for middle class

32

humans are all *itthārammana*s. The hard-to-come-by physical appearance and the sound of the Sammasambuddha etc. and those of man and woman are very pleasant and adorable *ati- itthārammana*s. The smell of faecal materials, rotten dead dog and man are of repulsive kinds; disturbing sounds, unpleasant smell, disagreeable tastes and touches are *anitthārammana*s. This is how determination is made regarding the _itthārammana_ and _anitthārammana_. This is the _atthakathāvāda_; the _samānavāda_. (_Abhi.-Ttha_.-2: 10).

In this _vādū_, note that the formation of _ittha_ or _anittha_ on an object among the upper. Medium and lower strata humans does not occur during the _vipākaviññāna_, but during by **_javanasena_** = the force of _javanna_ (impulsion)

The Venerable _Tipiṭakacûļābhayatthera_ has indicated as follows.

The _iṭṭhārammaṇa_ and _aniṭṭhārammaṇa_ are determined not by the force of _javana_ (impulsion) but by the force of _vipākaviññāṇa_ (consciousness acquired through practice). Because of wrong concept = the clinging, the attachment = may result in _lobha_, and also _dosa_, can be formed within a single _iṭṭhārammaṇa_ by force of _vipaļāsa_. Within a single _aniṭṭhārammaṇa_ can be formed the attachment = _lobha_, and also _dosa_. Therefore, the _iṭṭhārammaṇa_ and _aniṭṭhārammaṇa_ should not be determined on the basis of the force of _javana_.

Therefore, the _iṭṭhārammaṇa_ and _aniṭṭhārammaṇa_ should be determined only by virtue of _vipākaviññāṇa_. In fact _vipākacitta_ never deceives. An _ārammaṇa_ may be an _iṭṭhārammaṇa_—(let the _javana_ dominated by any one of _kusla_, _akusala_, _somanassa_, _do- manassa_, _upakkhā_), then the *vipākaviññāṇa*s are definitely _kusalavipāka, pañcaviññāṇa_, _sampaṭicchana_, _santīrana_ of *tadārammaṇa*s. An _ārammaṇa_ may be an _aniṭṭhāram-maṇa_— (let the _javana_ dominated by any one of _kusla_, _akusala_, _somanassa_, _do-manassa_, _upakkhā_), then the *vipākaviññāṇa*s are definitely _akusalavipāka, pañcaviññāṇa_, _sampaṭicchana_, _santīrana_ of *tadārammaṇa*s. For this reason, the determination of the

The Venerable _Tipiṭakacûļābhayatthera_ has indicated as follows.

Because of wrong concept = the clinging, the attachment = may result in _lobha_, and also _dosa_, can be formed within a single _iṭṭhārammaṇa_ by force of _vipaļāsa_.

Therefore, the _iṭṭhārammaṇa_ and _aniṭṭhārammaṇa_ should be determined only by virtue of _vipākaviññāṇa_. In fact _vipākacitta_ never deceives. An _ārammaṇa_ may be an _iṭṭhārammaṇa_—(let the _javana_ dominated by any one of _kusla_, _akusala_, _somanassa_, _do- manassa_, _upakkhā_), then the *vipākaviññāṇa*s are definitely _kusalavipāka, pañcaviññāṇa_, _sampaṭicchana_, _santīrana_ of *tadārammaṇa*s.

For this reason, the determination of the

_Micchādiṭṭhi_ (wrong viewers), those with conception outside the bounds of the _sāsanā_, turn their blind eyes when they encounter _Sammāsambuddha_ (the Enlightened One), or Ariya-Sanghā (the Noble Sanghā) or Mahā-Cetiya (e.g. Shwedagon) etc. of noble *ārammaṇa*s, feel unhappy at heart. They would close their ears when the Buddha's sermon is heard. Their eyes and ears may be closed, and having heavy hearts, yet the chance of instantaneous vision of *Sammāsambudha*s, and hearing of their sermons are due to their past _kusala_ (meritorious deeds of their previous existence). Because of these deeds, the _cakkuvññāna_ (seeing consciousness) and _sotaviññāna_ (hearing consciousness) are the *kusalavipāka*s (results of meritorious actions).

When countryside pigs sense the smell of human organic refuse, they feel happy at heart due to the notion that they are going to have a feast on it. The _cakkhuvññāna_ that enable the pigs to see, the _ghānaviññāna_ that enable them to smell, and _jivhāviññāna_ that enable them to taste the refuse are _akusalavipākaviññāna_ which have resulted from the past _akusala_ actions. A pig, tied with ropes, may be laid on a comfortable bed by its owners, but the pig may be squeaking distressfully. But, because of _saññāvipallāsa_, the wrong perception, the comfort provided could not be appreciated. By such a wrong

perception, a _jhāna_ (absoprtion) of grief, instead of comfort, arises in the pig’s _jhāna_. The comfortable feeling of the bed = _kāya-viññāna-citta_ (consciousness by way of touch), associated with the _sukha_-_vedanā_ (feeling of joy) and which realizes _phoṭṭhabbā_-_rammana_, is the result of good deeds in the previous life. It is, therefore, only the _kusala upāka_. The _ārammana_ is the _iṭṭhārammana_ (_Abhi_- _ṭha_-2:10).

With regard to recognizing _ārammana_ (object) as _iṭṭha_ (agreeable) and _aniṭṭha_ (disagreeable) as described above, three *vāda*s have been recognized: _rucivasena_, _jhāna_- _vasena_, and _vipākavasena_.

1. _Rucivasena_ (sophistry) – A sophist differentiates _ārammana_ either as _iṭṭha_ or _aniṭṭha_ according to his own liking. _Ruci_ is a kind of _chandha_ that arises at _javanacittupāda_ (beginning of impulsive consciousness) moment. In the sophistry, the nature of _iṭṭha_ and _aniṭṭha_ are not considered separately.
1. _Javanavasena_ (determination of _iṭṭha_ and _aniṭṭha_ by virtue of impulsion) – In the _vāda_ of _porāṇakaṭṭhcariya_ (ancient authorities), taking of a _jhāna_ as _iṭṭha_ or _aniṭṭha_ by the people of upper, middle and lower strata does not arise at the instant of _vipāka_-_viññāna_, but only when _jhāna_ is attained. This _vāda_, therefore, is referred to as the principle of determining _iṭṭha_ and _aniṭṭha_ by means of _javana_. In this _porāṇakaṭṭhcariya_, there is a determination, in relation to sentient beings of middle stratum, of _iṭṭha_ and _aniṭṭha_. (In

sophistry, there is no such a determination). ū

3. _Vipākavasena_ – In the _vāda_ of _Tipiṭakadhara cûļa-abhaya mathera_ the nature of the _iṭṭha_ and _aniṭṭha_ of a _javana_ are separately recognized. In so doing, it is not related with the _jhāna_, as is the case in the _porāṇakaṭṭhcariya_, but with _vipāka_. In the _iṭṭhārammana_ may arise _kusalavipāka_, _pañcaviññāna_, _sampaticchana_, and _tadārammana_ only. In the _aniṭṭhārammana_ may arise only* the *kusalavipāka*, *pañcaviññāna*, *sampaticchana*, and *tadārammana*. The *ārammana* (the object of meditation) of the *kusalaviññāna*s is the *iṭṭhārammana*, the *aniṭṭhārammana* being the *ārammana* of *akusalaviññāna*s. The relation of determination of *iṭṭha* and *aniṭṭha* with *vipāka*, but not with *jhāna*, is the only distinct feature of *vipākavasena\*.

**The Vāda that the Venerable Mahābuddhaghosa Appreciated** ū

Of the three above *vāda*s, the Venerable Mahābuddhaghosa seems more favorable to that of the Venerable _Tipiṭakadhara cûļa-abhaya mathera_, as indicated below.

_Yathā cittha, evum sabbattha – yo yo aṭṭhakathāvādo vo theravādo vā pacchā vuccati so pamāṇto daṭṭhabbo_ (_Vi_- _ṭha -_ 1:260)

It has been asserted in _Parājikam_ _Aṭṭhakathā_ second _Parājika Padabhājanī-yavuṇṇa_ as – Such and such _aṭṭhakathā vāda_ as well as _theravāda_ have been explained

laūtly. And that last explained _vāda_ is worth taking to heart.

_Mûļaṭīkā_ Sayādaw too has stated as given below.

_Vipākam pana katthaci na sakkā vañcetunti vipākavaūena_ ū

 _iṭṭhāniṭṭhārammanavavutthānam suṭṭu vuttam_ (_Mûļaṭī_-2:8) _Vipākavasena sundaram vuttanti vipākavasena Tipiṭakadhara-cûļa-abhayattherena vuttham su sundaram, rucivasena javanavasena vuttham sundaranti_

_addhippāyo_. – _Madhu_. ū

_Vipākaviññāna_ cannot be circumvented whatever the _ārammana_ may be. The explanation that determination of _iṭṭha_ and _aniṭṭha_ only by virtue of _vipākaññāna_ is a good work. Therefore, the Mûlaṭīkā Sayādaw Venerable Ãnandā Mathera also seems to like the determination of a _jhānana_ either as _iṭṭha_ or _aniṭṭha_ by power of _vipākaviññāna_,

but not the one made on the basis of one’s own liking.

**A Hard Nut to Crack**

For a noble person possessing knowledge that analytical realization, and when encountered with a _jhāna_, can determine whether _pañcaviññāna, sampaṭicchana,_

_Santīrana_ and _tadārammana_ are _kusalavipākaviññāna_ or _akusalavipākaviññāna_. This is made so based on the number and kinds of _cittacetasikka sampayutta dhamma_ (*dhamma*s associated with mental factors) groups included in the culture _vipāka ñaṇa_. For a foolish _andhabāla_ (blinded by folly) _puthujana_ (human), who is still blind to the _paramattha_ _ñaṇa_ (eye of knowledge of ultimate truth) on encountering a _jhāna_ cannot determine either as _kusalavipākaviññāna_ or _akusalavipākaviññāna_. Here, however, realization by one of either _kusalavipāka_ or _akusalavipāka_ is not necessarily important. It must be noted that arising of _kusalavipākaviññāna_ in _iṭṭhārammana_ and of _kusalavipākaviññāna_

in the _iṭṭhārammana_ is of prime importance. ū

Realization by one’s own self is concerned only with acquirement of _nāma_-_rûpa pariccheda_ _ñaṇa_.

**It is Not Only Due to _Saññāvippallāsa_**

The _vippallāsa_ is not the only cause for wrong notion of

1. _Iṭṭha_ as _aniṭṭha_ and
1. _Aniṭṭa_ as _iṭṭha_.

It can also be due to

1. By power of _sītatejo_ (cold temperature) in cold season when the temperature is in extreme condition, and _ohṇatejo_ (hot temperature) is in extreme condition, and changes of element called _dhātukkhobha_ (alteration of elements) = shock due to altered elements and
1. The causes such as poor eyesight, hard of hearing, lost of taste, and old-age debilities

of controlling principles, for example the eye power etc.

Because of the wrong notion of the _Iṭṭha_ as _aniṭṭha_ and* vice versa, the *Kusala- vipāka* and *akusalavipāka\* are formed correspondingly.

Cold water during the hot season can relieve one of suffering from heat, and it is the cause from arising of _kusalavipākaviññāṇa_. For that person cold water is an _iṭṭhā-_

_rammana_ which a gives a good feeling on contact.

The cold water again becomes the cause for arising of _akusalavipāka kāyaviññṇa_ for a person suffering cold during the cold season. The cold water on contact gives a bad feeling of _aniṭṭhārammana_ on the person feeling very cold.

A piece of cotton wool, which usually gives a smooth feeling on touch, could be the cause for painful feeling when applied on a fresh wound, for _akusalavipāka dukkha sahagutta kāyaviñāṇa_. The touch with the cotton wool is an _aniṭṭhaphoļabbārammana_

causing a painful feeling on the wound.

The contact with the cotton wool is the cause of good feeling for a person without wound. The cause for arising of _kusalavipāka sukasahagutta kāyaviñāṇa_. The contact with the cotton wool is an enjoyable feeling of _iṭṭhaphoļabbārammana_ for a person without wound. Message with a gentle hand will be a good feeling and forms _kusala_-_vipāka sahagutta_ for the one messaged. This is because the object is an _iṭṭhārammana_. The same gentle hand will cause an unpleasant suffering and _akusalavipāka sahagutta_

when slapped in the face. It is an _aniṭṭhaphoļabbārammana_ for the one being slapped. ūū

Determination of _iṭṭha_ and _aniṭṭha_ based on _vipāka_ as explained by the Venerable _Tipiṭakadhara cûļa-abhaya mathera_ is quite acceptable (_Mûlaṭī_ – 2:10).

With reference to the determination of _iṭṭha_ and _aniṭṭha_, the early teachers used to assert “_vipāka_ as the right and _jhāna_ the opposite.” It is the _kusalavipāka_ if the object is _iṭṭhārammana_, and _aniṭṭhārammana_ object for the _akusalavipāka_. The _jhāna_, even if it is _iṭṭhārammana_, may be influenced by _dosa_- _jhāna_ (impulsion of hate), instead of _somanassa_- _jhāna_ (impulsion of feeling of joy), because of the _saññāvipallāsa_. It so happens because, though the right arising _vipāka_-_citta_ (resultant consciousness) occurs,

the arising of _jhāna citta_ (impulsion consciousness) is abnormal.

**Determination of _Iṭṭha_ – _Aniṭṭha_ by Way of _Dvāra_**

One should also know the way of determining _iṭṭha_ and _aniṭṭha_ by virtue of dvāra. Soft and delicate texture of human organic refuse is repulsive to _cakkhu-dvāra_ (eye door) and _ghāna-dvāra_ (nose door) is _aniṭṭhārammana_. Because of its smooth texture to the

contact with the hand, it is _pholabbārammana_ to _kāyadvāra_.

For those who have been thrown at with ruby by King Cakkavatta, or one who has been pierced through with his gold lance, find these two to be the *aniṭṭhārammana*s to their _kāyadvāra_, but are *iṭṭhārammana*s to their _cakkhudvāra_. This is because the ruby or the lance in the presence case cause a great suffering to the subject. It should be, in fact, noted that, determination of either _iṭṭha_ or _aniṭṭha_ is made via the power of _iṭṭha-vipāka citta_.

In this way the determination of either _iṭṭha_ or _aniṭṭha_ can be achieved by the following ways:

1. By way of wish in individuals of middle strata,
1. By the power of _vipāka_ _citta_,
1. By way of the _dvāra_ (sense door), and
1. By way of the season such as cold or hot.

**_USSADA KITTANA KATHā_** (The Dominance Expresses Itself)

The description of the causes of the merits of _guṇa_ of _alobha_ and demerits of _lobha_ in many and varied ways are referred to as _Ussada Kittana Kathā_. It is section which gives a good lesson, as given below, to those who are only at the stage of sansāric travelers.

1. To be delivered from the _bhava,_
1. For attainment of a _bhava_ of a higher state,
1. To change the _citta-dhātu_ to a better state,
1. To elevate the _citta-dhātu_.

If a meditator happens to be an _Uttamapurisa_, a man of highest ideal, who can

terminate the sansāric journey in the present existence, then this section would not necessarily apply to him. For one who cannot end the sansāric journey however hard he

tried, or expecting future existence, then this section wilū be of utmost importance.

If you meditator have successfully cultivated the _rûpa_ and _nāma_ *dhamma*s analytically to the ultimate truth, then it is expected of you that you have realized

1. The causes of _kusala_ and
1. The causes of the _akusala_.

The merits and demerits of _kusala_ and _akusala_ through out the _sansāric_ circus have been described in this chapter. This **_Ussada Kittana Kathā_** is explained in _Aṭṭhālinī Aṭṭhakthā_ as follows.

In the _santāna_ of sentient being traveling round and round sansāric circus are

1. Excessive _lobha_,
1. Excessive _dosa_,
1. Excessive _moha_,
1. Excessive _alobha_,
1. Excessive _adosa_, and
1. Excessive _amoha_.

What makes these permanent, anū what causes these excessive?

_Pubbehetu niyāmeti_. _Kammāyûha-nakkhaṇeyeva nānattam hoti_ (_Abhi_-_ṭṭha_-: 1 – 308).

_Pubbehetu_, the factors of the past, are the cause for permanency and variety, and exert management over these. When effort had been made in the past, which has resulted in the still functioning _kamma_ of the present _bhava_, they have been of various kinds, differing in different individuals. The *kamma*s have caused the resultants as greedy

persons or non-greedy persons etc. See the following explanation sensu lato.

**INDIVIDUALS OFūTHE FIRST KIND** ū

_Yassa hi kammayûhanakkhaṇe loko balavā hoti, alobho mando, adosāmoho blavunto, dosamohā mandā, tassa mando alobho lobham pariyādātum nasakkoti, adosomohā pana balavunto dosamohe pariyādātum sakkonti_. _Tasmā so tena kammena dinnapaṭissandhi- vasena nibbatto luddho hoti, sukhasīlo akkomano, paññāvā pana hoti vjirûpañaṇoti_ (_Abhi_-_ṭṭha_-: 1 – 308).\*

In the _santāna_ of a person at the moment of cultivating in the past for acquiring

the five-fold *khandhā*s of the present the following would prevail.

1. _Lobha_ would in its full strength.
1. _Alobha_ would be weak and in dormant state.
1. _Adosa_ (= _mettā_), _amoha_ (= _paññā_) are in their full strengths.
1. _Dosa_ and _moha_ are weak and in dormant state.

When effort had been made on the _kamma_ cultivation, the weak and dormant _alobha_ was not able to exert its influence on the eradication or overcoming of _lobha_.

Again at a time of _kamma_ was cultivation the _adosa_ and _amoha_ were so strong that they overcome and eradicate the _dosa_ and _moha_. Therefore, a person in a certain life time, via rebirth, when a _kamma_ of high _dosa_ was functioning, will result as an individual given below.

1. A greedy person (result of being greedy).
1. Thought greedy, he lives a peaceful life. Not easily angered = not short-tempered. (result of being non-greedy).
1. A man of wisdom with sharp mental properties. (result of _amoha_)

(_Abhi_-_ṭha_-: 1 – 308).

Because when _kamma_ was performed, it was overwhelmed with greed, resulting in a greedy person highly attached to both living and non-living _kāmavatthu_. Because of _adosa_ = powerful _mettā_-_kamma_ on other living beings, _sukhasīla_ = he used to lead a peaceful life, being not annoyed, not angered and of a good temperament. Because of _amoha_ = _kamma_ of high _nāṇa paññā_, he becomes a person of wisdom sharp like a thunderbolt. The property of the past element is reflected in the present. And such

properties will exert their influence in the future life.

The story of the would-be wealthy Jotika and his elder brother, each offering a sugar cane to a _paccekabuddha_, at a certain time before the enlightened Vipassī and prior

to the arrival of _sāsanā_ should be flashed back.

The younger brother, offering a sugar cane, wished for the peaceful existence as human-_devā-nibbāna_, while the elder brother wished for the _nibbāna_ only.

The alms offered are similar as was the alms recipient. But their minds were set differently. The younger brother _Jotika_ cultivated his _dāna kamma_ surrounded by _lobha_ attached to richness as a human and a _vedā_. While making such an offer, he had _adosa mettā dhātu_ upon the _paccekabuddha_. The knowledge of _Sammādiṭṭhi-ñāṇa_, which understands the _kamma_ and its resultant formations, prevails in his heart. As the elder brother made a wish only for the _nibbāna_, his _dāna_-_kamma_ was surrounded by _alobha_,

*adosa amoha dhatu*s only. These three elements were in full power then.

At the time of resultant formation of these _kamma_, the two brothers were reborn to an extremely rich man. On encountering the _sāsanā_ of the Enlightened Vipassī, the elder brother, who had cultivated the _kamma_ surrounded by _alobha_, _adosa_ and _amoha_, transferred al his wealth to his younger brother, and entered the world of the _sāsanā_. He practiced on the *dhamma*s to become an ascetic. He was able to relieve himself of attachment to all the wealth acquired based on _alobha_ _kamma_, for which he became a

non-greedy person.* By power of *adosa* = *mettā*-*dhātu*, he led a peaceful ascetic life. By the power of *amoha* = *ñāṇa paññā\*, he had realized the four Noble Truth analytically so as to attain Arahatta-Magga (the Path of Arahatta) and Arahatta-Phala (the Fruit of

Arahatta). He acquired a life of a man of great wisdom.

The younger brother, on the other hand, cultivated the _kamma_ surrounded by _lobha_ and with attachment to richness, could not relieved himself of his wealth. Greatly attached to his wealth, he became a greedy person. The _alobha_-_dhātu_ of his could not overwhelm the powerful _lobha-dhātu_. That _kamma_ was, however, surrounded by _adosa_ = _mettā_-_dhātu_ and _amoha_ = _ñāṇa paññā_, for which he had a powerful _mettā_-_dhātu_ upon the Enlightened Vipassī. He built a monastery which he offered as _dāna_ to Him. He also

bore a great _mettā_-_dhātu_ upon all human beings.

With a mind influenced by _mettā_, he spread rubies knee-deep around the monastery. A declaration allowing any body to take a handful of rubies has also been made. This was made for mankind to acquire _kusala_-*cetanā*s by paying homage to the Enlightened Vipassī, to be able to culture *kusala dhamma*s by listening to His sermon, and to acquire special knowledge. He bore very high loving-kindness on human beings. He had in mind that those who did not want to pay homage, but still want the rubies, would come to the monastery. Then they would pay homage and listen to the expatiation of the Enlightened Vipassī. If so they could acquire _Magga_ _ñāṇa_ and _Phala-ñāṇa_. These are the noble _mettā_ and noble consciousness the he had on the mankind. These are results of causes such as _adosa_ and _amoha_. But because his _alobha_-_dhātu_ could not annihilate the _lobha_-_dhātu_, he had to journey through (91) worlds. In the duration of each world, the collection of human bones of a single person, if left undestroyed, could attain the height Mount Vepulla. If a man has to pass through (91) worlds, then the total heap of his bones will of the height of (91) such mountains. Therefore, clinging to the human _bhava_ and the riches, or culturing a _kamma_ surrounded by _lobha_-_dhātu_ clinging to a human _bhava_ or its riches is no better than attachment to death and decay resulting in such a huge heap of bones. The wealthy Jotika, on the other hand, also wished for _nibbāna_ and has resulted in being relieved of all the worldly affairs during time the

Buddha _sāsanā_.

If Ussada Kittana Kathā scrutinized, it will be seen that depending upon the past _kamma_, the corresponding results would arise in the present existence as given below.

1. A greedy and non-greedy person,
1. A bad-tempered person and a good-tempered one,
1. A man of great wisdom and of an inferior wisdom.

One can realized that the past _kamma_ organized the above three situations. Whatever _kamma_ one may have performed in the present existence, it would give corresponding results in the consecutive lives to come.

Therefore, in cultivating a _kamma_ it should be surrounded by noble _mettā_-_dhātu_, _karuṇā_ and higher wisdom, but not by inferior *dhātu*s such as the _lobha_, _dosa_, _māna_ (conceit), _issā_ and _micchera_.

Now that we are in the domain of Buddha _sāsanā_, we should practice as given

below.

Way of practice for acquirement of _samādhi_ is in hand, all we have to do is to make effort to have lofty _mettā_-_dhātu_, good consciousness and _mettā_-_javana_. There also are instructions for practicing to acquire higher status of _karuṇā-dhātu, muditā-dhātu_ and\* _upekkhā-dhātu_ and maintained in the heart.

If you have successfully practiced these _samādhi_ exercises and put to practical application, the _mettā_-_dhātu karuṇā-dhātu, muditā-dhātu_ and _upekkhā-dhātu_ will always reside in your consciousness. Then your mind will always be of very highly state. If you cultivate a _kamma_ surrounded by such a high state consciousness, then when a result has

a chance to arise in certain existence you will be endowed the following qualities on the sentient beings

1. A person of great _mettā_-_dhātu_,
1. A person of great _karuṇā-dhātu_,
1. A person of great _muditā-dhātu_, and
1. A person of great _upekkhā-dhātu_.

These are minds of higher state a traveler along the sansāric journey should have upon fellow travelers. These are the most desirable very noble exercises and are therefore

designated as the _brahmacariya_ (good walk of life). ūūū

In this _sāsanā_ also are present very high standard of exercises for _paññā_. Just refer back to the section on the _rûpa-kammaṭṭāna_ and _nāma-kammaṭṭhāna_ described previously. Exercise in discerning infinitesimal particles, called _rûpa_-_kalāpa_ in the _rûpa_-_loka_ (material world), realization by eye of wisdom of these atomic particles and their ultimate truth, _vīthi_- _citta_ (thought process) that arises along the _citta_-_niyāma_ (methods of mental culture) concentrated to the attainment of the ultimate truth are all explicitly given in the Sammā- Sambuddha Buddha _sāsanā_. The exercises for concentration on causal relationship _paṭicca- samuppāda_ and for _vipassanā_ are available in this _sāsanā_ only. If

practicallū successful in exercising on these, then the following can be acquired.

1. _Nāma-rûpa-pariccheda_ _ñāṇa_ the insight knowledge of mind and matter,
1. _Paccaya-pariggaha ñāṇa_ the analytical knowledge realizing the causes of mind and matter
1. _Vipassanā ñāṇa_ the insight knowledge that realizes the _anicca, dukkha, anatta_ of *sankhāra dhamma*s to the attainment of the Path and the Fruit,
1. _Ariya Magga_ _Ñāṇa_ Noble Path knowledge,
1. _Ariya Phala Ñāṇa_ Noble Fruit knowledge.

These are knowledges of very high status, not available anywhere except in the Buddha _sāsanā_, nor are they available in the modern science world, nor in philosophies outside

the _sāsanā_. ū

A meditator’s mind decorated with such knowledge of higher state is also highest _citta_-_dhātu_. The _rûpa_-_nāma_ _santāna_ of a meditator’s mind practiced to attain a high state could provide the following benefits.

1. Deliver him from _apāya_ (miserable world)
1. Deliver him from miserable phenomena of ageing, suffering, death and decay and rebirth.
1. If the meditator is still going round the sansāric journey, it will organize in such a way as to make him a clever man of wisdom.

These indicate how you can uplift your _citta_-_dhātu_ by cultivating high state _mettā- dhātu_, _karuṇā-dhātu_, _muditā-dhātu, upekkhā-dhātu_, _alobha-dhātu_, _adosa-dhātu_ and _amoha- dhātu_ (wisdom). In this way the wisdom would raise your _bhava_ to a higher status and relieved you of miserable sufferings. In a way, it uplifts a man above ordinary

man and a deity above the other deity.

The *buddha*s, innumerable as sand grains on the banks the River Ganges, have become enlightened because of cultivating _citta-dhātu_ decorated with better elements such as the ten-fold *paramī*s. You, gentleman, can also have the mind which can be

enlightened if you make great effort in improving it.

If you culture your mind surrounded by inferior _citta-dhātu_, then your _citta_ will be of inferior status, and you would be leading a variety of *bhava*s of low quality.

Suppose you cultivated your _kamma_ surrounded by _lobha_ as attachment to one another as a husband and a wife and wishing that you are always together be it the life of a bird, and suppose you two have perform _kusala kamma_ together. At a certain time, when that _kamma_ bears result, and if you happen to encounter one another, then you will always be intimately together. Unfortunately, if one partner has been a drunkard, you, as

wife, will still be attached to him however much abuse he would inflict on you.

In the same way if you had wished for a life as a wealthy person, and the time for result has come, then you will acquire a wealthy life attached to your wealth like the wealthy Jotika. If your wish has been for higher professional post, you will be attached to it.

If you have cultivated a _kamma_ surrounded by _dosa_, and dissatisfaction, you will become a man of great anger and of dissatisfaction when that _kamma_ bears the result.

You will not be satisfied with any body in the world.

Suppose you cultivated _kamma_ been surrounded by _citta-dhātu_ of boastfulness, will to take advantage over others, being self-esteemed, and looking down upon others – that is _lobha_ and _māna_. Then that _kamma_ will result in you being a boastful person, and high-handed in dealing with others, will always be thinking high of yourself.

If your _kamma_ is cultured surrounded by envious mind on others, then when that _kamma_ produced result, you lead and envious _bhava_. This _issa dhamma_, which is a mind envious on others’ success or wealth endowed with powers which can end the life a _devā_.

A _kamma_ cultivated with _maccheriya_-_dhātu_ (selfishness) would result in a person overwhelmed by _maccheriya_. He would be too sensitive to those even lingering to his possessions including his wealth, wife and children.

Realizing the above situations, if you would like to be delivered from the sansāric circus, or like to lead a _bhava_ of higher status, then you will have change your mind and raise to a higher standard. Every day and from moment to moment, with the motion of your hands, legs and mouth there occur _kāya-kamma, vajī-kamma_ and _mano-kamma_,

(the body function, verbal function and mental function). For these *kamma*s to be surrounded always by good elements effort is made on _samatha_, _vipassanā_ and _bhāvanā_ exercises most the time. In other words, the *kamma*s should be surrounded by _saddhā, vīriya, sati, samādhi_ and _paññā_.

**INDIVIDUALS OF TūE SECOND KIND**

_Yassaūpana kammayûhanekkahṇe lobhadosā balavunto hunti, alobhadosā mandā, amoho balavā, moho mando, so purimanayeneva luddho ceva hoti duṭṭho ca, paññavā pana hoti_

_vajīrûpamañāṇo, dattābayatthero viya_

A person, at the moment of cultivating a _kamma_, might have _lobha_ and _dosa_ in his _santāna_. He would have a heap of _lobha_ attached to the prevailing _bhava_, to the material things and his status in the society while trying to cultivate meritorious _kamma_. At that moment _alobha_ and _adosa_ (_metta_-_dhātu_) factors very recessive. _Ahoma_, _paññā_, however, quite dominant. When the _kamma_, cultured with surrounding _lobha_, has the chance to bear result, the person would be a greedy one. The _kamma_ cultured surrounded by _dosa_, would result in a person of great _dosa_ (anger). Because of _amoha-dhātu_ during

 that moment, the person would be of sharp wisdom like Tattābhaya Mathera.

**INDIVIDUALS OF TūE THIRD KIND**

_Yassa pana kammāyûhanaekkhaṇe lobhadosamohā balavunto hunti, ittare mandā_. _So purimanayeneva liddo ceva hunti candho ca_, _sukhasīlako pana hoti ekkodhano_

A person at the moment of culturing a _kamma_ (= a _kusala_ _kamma_ resulting in a human _bhava_) has powerful _lobha_, _adosa_ and _moha_ in his _santāna_. The _alobha_, _dosa_ and _amoha_, on the other hand, are weak. At a time when that _kamma_ produces a resultant _bhava_ by rebirth power, the person would be a greedy individual. It is because the weak _alobha_ could not influence the powerful _lobha_. In the same way, the weak _amoha_ could not overwhelm the poweful _moha_, for which the person would become mentally low, dumb and dull individual. When the _kamma_ was cultivated, however, _dosa_ was recessive but _adosa_ was dominant. Because of powerful _adosa_ = _metta_, it could dominate the

weak _dosa_, resulting in man having peace of mind and of a good tempered in nature.

**A FACT TO BE NOTED**

It should be noted of the fact that if a good deed is done by someone without wisdom, then the resultant individual in a certain _bhava_ will be an ignorant person of inferior mentality. A _kamma_ should not performed without due consideration. It is because once a _kamma_ has been performed, then it cannot be withdrawn. (The cause _kamma_ will always produce result, good or bad). It can only be eradicated by _Vipassanā ñāṇa_, _Magga-ñāṇa_, and _Phala_-_ñāṇa_. The eradiation is the function of _Arahatta-Magga_-_ñāṇa_. The *kamma*s of whatever kind that is going to give results in the wake of _parinibbānacuti_ can only be eradicated by _Arahatta-Magga_-_ñāṇa_ because it has the

power to do so.

At the expense of money, one performs a good deed, but it results in an ignorant, dumb and low-grade person, which is thing of sorrow. Therefore, whatever good deed is done it has to be associated with wisdom. Now a brief explanation on _ñāṇa_ and _paññā_ is pertinent here.

**_CATUSACCASAMMāDIṭṭHI_**

(The Right Vision on the Four-Fold Realities)

_Katamā ca bhikkhave sammādiṭṭhi_? _Yam kho bhikkhave dukkhe ñāṇam, dukkha samudaye ñāṇam, dukkha nirodhe ñāṇam, dukkhagāminiyā paṭpadāya ñāṇam_. _Ayam vuccati bhikkave sammādiṭṭhi_ (_Ma_.- 1 :88).

_Sammādiṭṭhi_, _paññindre = paññā, amoha, dhammavicaya_ all different terms referring to the single _dhamma_ _paññindre cetasika_. ū

1. The knowledge that realizes the five-fold _upādānakkhandā_ and _dukkhasaccā_ *dhamma*s existing as _atīta_ (past), _anāgata_ (future) and _paccuppanna_ (present), _ijjhatta_ (internal), _bahiddha_ (external), _oļārika_ (gross), _sukhuma_ (subtle), _hīna_ (low), _paṇīda_ (lofty), _dûra_ (far), _santika_ (near) phenomena. Among the _saccā dhamma_ group are included *jhāna dhamma*s.

2. As exhorted in the Añguttora Tikanipāta Tithāyatana Suttana, the knowledge that realizes the causal relationships of _paṭiccasamuppāda_ in its real sense and understands the _samudaya-saccā_ Here in this case, _kammassakatā sammādiṭṭhi_, which can pene-tratively realize the _kamma_–its results, involved completely. This is the _kammassakatā sammādiṭṭhi_ of highest status. This knowledge, not acquired from others, but from one’s own penetrative practical realization of the _kamma_ and its resultants, is therefore referred to as highest state of knowledge. Knowledge of _kamma_-resultant acquired from the teachers is not as high as that from one’s own practical understanding. Though relatively not high, for _puthujana_ humans who cannot yet attain _paramatta_ by eye of wisdom, the knowledge acquired through the teachers could be employed as basis to guess _kamma_-resultant phenomena by means of _anumāna_ consciousness. This can be _kammassakatā_ –_sammādiṭṭhi_. If realization cannot be made even of _kammassakatā sammādiṭṭhi_, or not acquired at all, then any _kusala-kamma_ would be of very low status. If that kind of

_kamma_ bears result, the person would be ignorant, dumb and inferior.

3. _Vipassanā ñāṇa_ (insight knowledge)* that penetratively understands the *bhañga* or perishing away of the arising and dissolution of *sankhāra dhamma*s, *asankhata-dhātu,* peaceful element the *nibbāna* which are the *dhamma*s of the cessation of the *sankhāra*s = *ariya magga\* _ñāṇa_ which penetrtatively realizes _nirodha saccā_ phenomenon, are all the _sammādiṭṭhi ñāṇa_. (The _vipassanā ñāṇa_ is the _lokī sammādiṭṭhi_, and the _ariya magga_ _ñāṇa_ the _lokuttara sammādiṭṭhi_). This the _sammādiṭṭhi_ which understands the _nirodha_ _sacca_ (the truth of cessation).
4. Realization of the _lokī magga saccā_ and _lokuttarā_ _magga saccā_ penetratively, via penetrative exercises, to the attainment of _nibbāna_, where the *dukkha*s (sufferings) have ceased, is _sammādiṭṭhi_ too. All that is _sammādiṭṭhi_ are included in _catusaccasammādiṭṭhi_, and oriented towards it. Therefore, _sammādiṭṭhi_ can be classed as follows.
5. _Kammassakatā_ _sammādiṭṭhi_ = _Sammādiṭṭhi_ that realizes the fact that _kamma_ is the only possession of yours.

1) The _Kammassakatā_ _sammādiṭṭhi,_ the belief based on knowledge handed down

from the teachers, a knowledge called _anumāna_ _ñāṇa_.

2. The _Kammassakatā_ _sammādiṭṭhi_ that understands the nature of causalūrelationship

of the _dukkha saccā_ and _samudaya saccā dhammas_ by means of _nāma_-_rûpa_ _pariccheda_ _ñāṇa_ and _paccayapariggaha_ _ñāṇa_ acquired through penetrative realization of

_paccakkha_ _ñāṇa_.

2. _Chāna_ _sammādiṭṭhi_ = _sammādiṭṭhi_ that is associated with _chāna sammādi_ (belongs to the _ñāṇa_ that realizes the _dukkha saccā_).
3. _Vipassanā sammādiṭṭhi_ = the _sammādiṭṭhi_ _ñāṇa_ that is associated with _vipassanā_ _ñāṇa_ which penetratively realizes the nature of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of _dukkha saccā_ and _samudaya saccā dhammas_.
4. _Magga sammādiṭṭhi_ = the _ñāṇa_ that is associated with the _ariya magga_.
5. _Phalasammādiṭṭhi_ = the _ñāṇa_ that is associated with the _ariya phala_.

The _sammādiṭṭhi ñāṇa_ can grossly be divided into five kinds in this way. All the five are included in the _catusaccā sammādiṭṭhi_. These *sammādiṭṭhi ñāṇa*s are usually

referred to as _amoha_ = _paññā_ (wisdom).

In cultivating a _kusala kamma_ (meritorious deed) one should at least have _Kam- massakatā_ _sammādiṭṭhi_ acquired through the teachers and which understands the fact that _kamma_ is the only one you possess. If not so and if the right concept could not be appreciated, then whatever _kusala kamma_ you do will only be _ñāvippayutta kusala_. The consequences of such *kusala*s would result in a dull, dumb, ignorant and inferior

personality. ū

If possible, one should attempt to acquire the _kammassakatā_ _sammādiṭṭhi_ arising from contemplating on the _nāma-rûpa pariccheda_ _ñāṇa_ and _paccaya pariggaha_ _ñāṇa_. If a _kusala kamma_ is cultured led by these *ñāṇa*s, then it can be a _kamma_ of high status. If that _kamma_ produces a result at a certain _bhava_ of person, then he would be man of high

wisdom.

If one is endowed with _jhāna sammādiṭṭhi ñāṇa_, then the _jhāna kusala cetanā_, associated with it, would have the power to produce to attain a high status _byahmā bhava_. These *jhāna*s can be maintained, the person can attain the realm of brahma at the time of

his death. ū

If a _kamma_ has been cultured surrounded by _vipassanā-sammādiṭṭhi ñāṇa_, then a noble man among men and noble deity among deities ūould be the result. However, it is essential that _rûpa-nāma kammaṭṭhāna_ is concentrated, as mentioned in this doctrine, to the attainment of the ultimate truth and of wisdom. If such a person perform a _kusala kamma_, such as alms-giving, by
ū

1. Concentrating by means of analytical knowledge, in his _santāna_, on the three general characters _anicca-dukkha-anatta_ of the _rûpa-nāma-paramatta_ phenomena, ūū
1. _Rûpa-nāma-paramatta_ in the _santāna_ of the alms-receivers, being externally similar, are collectively taken and contemplated upon their three characters by _vipassanā ñāṇa_,
1. And if the donated materials discerned in the form of the 4-fold _dhātus_, _kalāpa_ only the atomic particles will be visualized. These *kalāpa*s are just only the tejo *dhātu*s located interiorly = *ojaṭṭhamaka rûpa*s having eight _oja_ serially produced by physical changes (_utu_). By concentrating on the *ojaṭṭhamaka rûpa*s after analyzing with the wisdom, and meditating on the three characters of these.
1. Concentrating on _mahākusala manodvāravīthi_, the _nāma dhamma_ groups, led by _dāna kusala cetanā_ while exercising _vipassanā bhāvanā_ on the three characters of these

If a _dāna kusala_ has been cultured surrounded by _vipassanā_ _ñāṇa_, then it will be surrounded by the highest _vipassanā_ _ñāṇa_. When it has the chance to express its result in certain _bhava_ of a man by virtue of _paṭisandhe_, the he will be a man of penetrative and sharp wisdom.

The following is an example of sharp _ñāṇa_ as expounded by the Buddha in Sota- nugata Suttana.

*So muṭṭhaassati kālam*´ *karuṇāno aññataram*´ *deva nikāyam*´ _uppajjati_, _tassa tattha sukhito dhammapadā palavunti_, _danto bhikkhave satuppādo_, _atha so satto khippanyeva visesagāmī hoti_ (*Am*´-1: 505).

A certain ascetic failed to attain _magga ñāṇa_ (Path Knowledge) and _phala ñāṇa_ (Fruit Knowleūge) in spite of hard exercise he made on _vipassanā bhāvanā_. When he expired as an ordinary worldliūg he arrived, as a _paṭisandhe_ (_Opapātikapaṭisandhe_), at a certain plane of

deities. In the _santāna_ of that deity in that plane, where ease of mind prevails, will be _rûpa- nāma-sankhāra dhamma_ groups which are the object of _vipassanā ñāṇa_ will be conspicuous. Bhikkûs .. the formation of _sati_ (mindfulness) associated with _vipassanā ñāṇa_ which can concentrate on these ultimate truth of these _dhamma_ groups is still too slow. In fact, the deity can rapidly attain (the Path Knowledge, and Fruit

Knoweldge) the Noble _dhamma_ called the _nibbāna_ (*Am*´-1: 505).

This is an example of how higher wisdoms are acquired, leading to _nibbāna_, by cultivating _kamma_ surrounded by higher _vipassanā ñāṇa_.

_Tassa te sotānugatā hunti vacasā paricitā manassānupekkhitā diṭṭhiyā suppaṭividdhā_ (*Am*´-1: 505).

**\*Diṭṭhiyā suppaṭividdhā**ti atthato ca kāraṇato ca paññāya suļu paṭividdhā paccakkham katā* (*Am*´-*ṭṭha-\*2: 505). ūū

The deity, while existing as an ascetic in the human world, has learned the Buddha’s _dhamma_ and recited offhand, understood the real meaning of ultimate truth of the _rûpa_ and _nāma_. He could realize the real causes of the _rûpa_ and _nāma_ penetratively by means of _sammādiṭṭhi ñāṇa_ acquired through _sammādiṭṭhi ñāṇa paññā_. And has acquired the _vipassanā sammādiṭṭhi ñāṇa_. He was able to exercise on the vipassanā _bhāvanā kammaṭṭhāna_ up till _maraṇāsanna javana_ (death consciousness). While doing so his death consciousness is concentrating on the nature of _anicca,_ or of _dukkha_, or of

_anatta_ of the *sankhāra dhamma*s as the object.

The _paṭisandhe_ (rebirth), _bhavañga_ (consciousness of life continuum) and _cuti_ (the redeceased) of that deity will use in continuation the near death consciousness of the

ascetic as the object of concentration.

As the _bhavañga_ of recipient is concentrating on the *sañkhāra dhamma*s, i.e., on

the nature of either _anicca_, or _dukkha_, or _anatta_, then a _sati_ (mindfulness) associated with _vipassanā_ _ñāṇa_ which always reflect on those _dhamma_ may arise in the _santāna_ of deity. Then the appearance of the _sati_ associated with associated with the _vipassanā_ _ñāṇa_ is still too slow. In deed, in his _santāna_ the ascetic has the consciousness of the *dhamma*s practiced during the life time, and which the are objects of _ārammana_ of the _vipassanā_ _ñāṇa_ – **_pasanne ādāse chāyā viya palavunti, pākaṭā hutvā paññāyanti_** (*Am*´-_ṭa_.-2: 2 – 365).

-   The consciousness on the _ārammana_ will be clear as mirror images. Therefore,

the _nibbāna_ is attained rapidly because of slow appearance of the _sati_ associated with the _vipassanā_ _ñāṇa_ which can always concentrate on the *dūamma*s previously practiced.

It must be noted that verbal recitation of “_anicca-dukkha-anatta_” cannot the _vipassanā_ _ñāṇa_ be without realization of true _paramattha rûpa-nāma_. A _kamma_ sur-rounded by false _vipassanā_ _ñāṇa_ cannot promote one to a power of great wisdom as the

one does surrounded by the ture _vipassanā_ _ñāṇa_.

**INDIVIDUAL OF THE ūOURTH KIND** ū

_Tatthā yassa kammāyûhanakkhaṇe tayopi lobhadosamohā balavunto hunti_, _alābhādayo mandā_, _so purimanayeneva luddho ceva hoti duṭṭho ca mûļho ca_ (_Abhi.- ṭṭa_.- 1: 308).

Again, a certain individual might have cultivated a _kamma_ surrounded by _lobha_ (greediness), _dosa_, and _moha_ in his _santāna_, and which were very lofty at that moment, then the _alobha, adosa_ and _amoha_ would be weak. A time would come when that _kamma_ has the chance to give its results in a certain _bhava_ by virtue of _paṭisandhe_, then that person will be of greedy nature. It is because the _alobha_ was too weak to overcome the _lobha_. _Adosa_ was too weak to overcome _dosa_, so that the person will of great anger in nature. The person will be feeble-minded because the weak _amoha_ was unable to over

come the _moha_ (_Abhi.- ṭṭa_.- 1: 308).

Approaching and offering materials to a person known for giving hint on the lucky numbers of a certain raffle, offering flowers, light from an acacia wood and water to the Buddha’s stupas as instructed by an astrologer etc., are all *kamma*s surrounded by

_lobha, dosa_, and _moha_ dominant over the weak _alobha_, _adosa_ and _amoha_.

**Here is a point to consider**. Observe carefully the Buddha’s stupas standing at the designated corners for the purpose of receiving offer of water made by people. On staturdays, Sundays and other holidays, there are numerous people at the stupas for this purpose. Without any cover overhead, these stupas are all the time in rain or sun light. As one started making offer of water, others will follow suit in succession. In this way

the stupas will be watered throughout the day.

Think about it deeply. At home, would you be taking bath all the day? Only when you could imagine these stupas to be the real Buddha, concentrate on his guna and the blessing He has bestowed upon us as the object, then your good deeds would bring forth enjoyable results. If so, you could think of whether or not the stupas should be

offered water all the day.

What is being done is emphasized on what the astrologer has instructed, the element of _alobha_ is weak, being considerate on the Buddha = element of _mettā_ also is very weak. _Amoha_ (wisdom) was weak as the interest was only on what the astrologer

has said,and as the element of wisdom was lacking the real fact of the Buddha has been neglected. The _kamma_ has been made, surrounded dominantly by _lobha_, _dosa_, and _moha_, dominating the _alobha_, _adosa_, and _amoha_, (for purpose of his health, wealth, promotion to higher ranks). If that kind of _kamma_ has the chance to produce result at a certain _bhava_, then the person will be greedy, of great anger and low mentality. Such a result would arise along as the _alobha_, _adosa_, and _amoha_ cannot overcome the _lobha_,\*

_dosa_, and _moha_.

If a _kamma_ has been made and accomplished, all one can do accept its outcome, whatever the kind the resultant may be. A _kamma_ once dome can never be undone. However, if _vipassanā_ exercise can be made strenuously, then the _arahatta magga_ _ñāṇa_ would annihilate the results of those _kamma_ following the _parinibbāna cuti_ (complete extinction of _khandhā_).

**AN INDIVIDUAL OFūTHE FIFTH KIND**

_Yassa pana kammāyûhanakkhaṇe alobhadosamohā balavunto hunti_, _ittare_

_mandā_, _so purimanayeneva appakileso hoti dibbārammaṇampi disvā niccalo_, _duṭṭho pana hoti dandhapañño cāti_ (_Abhi.-ṭha_.- 1: 309).

At a moment of culturing a _kamma_ surrounded by _alobha_, _dosa_ and _moha_ will be dominant over the _lobha_, _adosa_ and _amoha_ in the _santāna_ of a person. Then, if that _kamma_ produces a result by virtue of _paṭisandhe_ at a certain _bhava_, the person have little attachment on the material objects. Even if he can realize the _ārammaṇa_ that belongs to the deity, he would not be shaken. In stead, he would lead a tranquil life. He is free of craving because, when the _kamma_ was made, it was surrounded by a strong element of _alobha_. He is, however, an individual of great hatred, of low mentality and of poor wisdom. It was because of weak _adosa_ and _amoha_, which could not overcome the _dosa_

and _moha_ at the time of culturing the _kamma_.

**INDIVIDUAL OF THū SIXTH KIND**

_Yassa pana kammāyûhalakkhaṇe alobhādosamohā balavunto hunti_, _ittare mandā_, _so purimanayeneva aluddho ceva hoti sukasīlako ca_, _danddho pana hoti_ (_Abhi.-ṭṭa_.- 1: 309)

At the moment of culturing a _kamma_, _alobha, adosa_ and _moha_ will be of great strength in a person’s _santāna_, dominating over the weak _lobha_, _dosa_ and _amoha_ at the same moment. If that _kamma_ produces a result by virtue of _paṭisandhe_ at a certain _bhava_, the person will be non-greedy, of little hatred but of great _mettā_ for which he will be living a peaceful life. While so cultivating he was relieved of attachment and craving on _karma_ objects and of the planes of life as the element of _alobha_ was in great strength. The _kamma_ was cultivated surrounded by element of _mettā_, and therefore element of _adosa_ was also of great strength. Because of the powers of the element _alobha_ and _adosa_ the person is of non- greedy and of little hatred in nature = a man of great _mettā_ element. When the _kamma_ was being cultivated, _ñāṇa paññā_ was not included, or weak if included, the weak _amoha_ element was not able to get rid of _moha_, the resulting person

will be of low mentality, deaf and dumb (_Abhi.-ṭṭa_.- 1: 309).

**INDIVIDUAL OF THEūSEVENTH KIND**

_Tathā yassa kammāyûhalakkhaṇe alobhādosamohā balavunto hunti_, _ittare mandā_, _so purimanayeneva aluddho ceva hoti_, _paññāvā ca duṭṭho ca pana hot kodhano_ (_Abhi.-ṭha_.- 1: 309).\*

Again at the moment of culturing a _kamma_, _alobha, dosa_ and _amoha_ are of great strength in a person’s _santāna_. The _lobha_, _adosa_ and _amoha_ all are too weak to express themselves. If the _kamma_, by virtue of _paṭisandhe_, could produce its result at a certain _bhava_ of a person, he will be a man of non-greediness, of no attachment to the living and non-living _karma_ material and of great wisdom. It was because while cultivating the _kamma_, it was surrounded by elements of _alobha_ and _amoha_. (It is the kind _kamma_ made by a good deed surrounded by elements of _alobha_ and _amoha_, similar to _vipassana_ _ñāṇa_ and wishing for _nibbāna_). While culturing the _kamma_, however, _dosa_ elements, such as discontentment, and destructiveness, were very strong. In other words, he was very short-tempered, and the strong dosa could not be overcome by weak _adosa_ = weak _mettā_ could not have overcome the dosa. If the _kamma_ has the chance to produce a result at a certain _bhava_, the person will have mind of destroying others. (He would have the kind of mind to destroy someone like crushing an ant with ease). He would be easily annoyed,

short-tempered and of great anger (_Abhi.-ṭha_.- 1: 309).

**INDIVIDUAL OF THū EIGHTH KIND**

_Yassa pana kammāyûhalakkhaṇe tayopi alobhādayo balavunto hunti_, _lobhādayo mandā_, _so_ “_mahāsangharakkhitattharo viya aluddho aduṭṭho paññavā ca hotī”ti_.

(_Abhi.-ṭha_.- 1: 309).

While cultivating a _kamma_, a person could have a strong _alobha, adosa_, and _amoha_ in his _santāna_, whereas _lobha, dosa_ and _moha_ were in weak conditions. When the _kamma_ bears its results at a certain _bhava_, the person will have the following features

like the Rev. Mahāsangha Rakkhata.

1. He is a person free of greedlessness and of attachment to living and non-living materials (He can easily be delivered). (It is due to the power of _alobha_).
1. He doe not have the will to cause destruction to sentient beings, but have a great _mettā_, wishing peace and prosperity on them. He has a mentality of gentle nature.

(It is due to the power of _adosa_).

3. He possesses a sharp wisdom. (It is due to the power of _amoha_ element, such as _vipassanā_ _ñāṇa_ the insight knowledge).

These are due to the powerful elements of _alobha, adosa_ and _amoha_ at the time of cultivation, and to ability to control his mental processes by means of insight knowledge).

Such a kind of person is always wishing repeatedly for _nibbāna_, entering the trance to be delivered from the suffering of the sansaric circus, and exercising _vipassanā_ _kammaṭṭhāṇa_ based on _mettā jhāna_.

**A GOOD CHANCE**

At this point in time, you are encountering the _sāsanā_ having the following

advantages:

1. You are able to listen to and learn the real presence of the _nibbāna_, the element of peacefulness, the _sañkhata dhatu_ that can relieve you off the suffering of the _sansarā vatta_.
1. You have a chance to listen and realize the 8-fold _Magga_, which are the Paths leading to _Nibbāna_.
1. There exist _ānāpāna jhāna_, _mettā jhāna_ etc., a feature of nibbāna-achieving exercises. The doors to contemplation of _ānāpāna jhāna_, _mettā jhāna_ are opened for you.
1. Based on _ānāpāna jhāna_, _mettā jhāna_, ways and means of meditation are also available. You have, therefore, the chance to attain _vipassanā_ destination.

**A GREAT WISDOM** ūūū

As a human body is made up of a multitude of *rûpaūkalāpa*s (corporeal units, or subatomic particles) which are of subatomic sizes. These *kalāpa*s in turn are comprised of at least 8 _rûpa paramatta_ referred to as _pathavī-āpa-tejo-vāyo-vuṇṇa-gandha-rasa-ojā_ (composite of earth-water-fire-air-color—smell-taste-nutrient). In some there are nine _rûpa paramatta_ and 10 in still some. Such statements about the material things had been made over 2500 years ago by the Buddha Sammāsambuddha. His disciples have been instructed to exerciser on the 8-fold Magga so as to realize these _kalāpas_. Following these instructions strictly the Venerable Sāriputtarā and the disciples of innumerable

numbers have realized the ultimate truth of the _rûpa_.

Can such a kind of knowledge be acquired outside the Sāsanā? Is there any one who can instruct an exercise outside the _Sāsanā_? The answer is “no.” If a disciple is possessed of such a knowledge by which the physical properties can be discerned on these subatomic particles to ultimate truth by analytical knowledge, then such a

knowledge is referred to as the ‘great wisdom.’

The Buddha’s ways of teaching on the _nāma_ _dhamma_ are beyond the capability of any preacher, a philosopher or a scientist. Exercising following the Buddha’s instructions, a disciple may have acquired realization and knowledge on the _nāma_ properties, concentrated to the attainment of the ultimate truth of the _nāma_ by destruction of it by analytical knowledge, then that knowledge should be regarded as the great

wisdom too.

Again, the causal relationship, the _paṭicca sammuppāda_, is the preaching that is available neither in other religious doctrines, nor in philosophies outside the Sāsanā. If a disciple practices following the Buddha’s instructions and penetratively realizes the ultimate truth of causal relationships, then that kind of knowledge must also be regarded

as the great wisdom.

The Buddha has ūxpounded the presence of a system of (31) planes, which is referred to as a universe, and existence of innumerable number of universe. Each (31) planes of the universe is comprised of the following.
ū

1. A mass of _rūpa dhamma_ only (refers to _asaññassata_)
1. A mass of _nāma dhūmma_ only (refers to _arûpa_ plane = plane of the formless )
1. A mass of _rûpa-nāma dhamma_ onlū (refers to _pañcavokāra_ plane)
1. A mass of these _rûpa nāma dhammas_ only (refers to _asaññassata_)
1. Cause-result phenomena of the _rûpa-nāma_ only = *sañkhāra dhamma*s

The above are

1. the features of _anicca_ (impermanence) *dhamma*s of arising and perishing away,
1. just the phenomena of formation and dissolution always causing continuous (_dukkha_) suffering and
1. _anatta_ phenomena (non-self).

The exercise of 8-fold Megga to acquire the knowledge related to insight knowledge

Suppose a disciple has acquired insight knowledge related to (_vipassanā_) by following instructions given by the Buddha. This knowledge should also be taken as the great wisdom, because it cannot be acquired outside the _Sāsanā_.

For a disciple the _Magga_ _ñāṇa_ (Path Knowledge) and _Phala_ _ñāṇa_ (Fruit Knowledge), which could penetratively realize the _nibbāna_, are the knowledge that have

attained their peaks.

It is, therefore, no wonder that a person would be of great wisdom as a result of cultivating a _kamma_ surrounded by _ñāṇa_ of great magnitude.

These are the systems of acquiring knowledge for higher mentality as given in the Buddhist Philosophy.

THE POWER OF _CITTA_

(THE MENTAL POWER)

_Cittena nīyati loko_, *cittena parikassati*ū

_Cittassa ekadhammassa_, _sabbeva vasamanvagû_ (*Sam -*1: 36. _Citta suttana_) ū

**\*Cittena nīyatī**ti abhisañkhāraviñāṇṇam sandhāyāha*, *tahnāsampayuttam vā* (*Mûlaṭī-\*1: 68)

_Kusalaviñāṇṇa_ and _akusalaviñāṇṇa_, which can bring about a new _bhava_, are the _abhisañkhāraviñāṇṇa_. The _Viñāṇṇa_ associated with _alobha, adosa_ and _amoha_ the _abhisañkhāraviñāṇṇa_. That which is associated with elements of _lobha_ (_tahṇā_), _dosa_ and _moha_ is the _akusala abhisañkhāraviñāṇṇa_.

The _citta_ mentioned in the above _Suttana_ refers to the _abhisañkhāraviñāṇṇa_.

The _citta_ element, called the _kusala abhisañkhāraviñāṇṇa_ associated with the _alobha, adosa_ and _amoha_, have the power to help a sentient being acquire deliverance

from the _nibbāna_ step by step at the consecutive _bhavas_.

Similarly, the _citta_ element, called the _akusala abhisañkhāraviñāṇṇa_ associated with the inferior elements of _lobha, dosa_ and _moha_, have the power to drag down a sentient being dumper and of more inferior mentality step by step at the consecutive _bhavas_.

All sentient beings in the sansāric circus follow the course made by the _citta_ called _kusala abhisañkhāraviñāṇṇa_ and _akusala abhisañkhāraviñāṇṇa_ (_Sam_.-1: 36; _Citta_ _Suttana_).

**EXERCISE YOUR MIND IN THIS WAY**

_Tassmūhita bhikkhave abhikkhaam sakam cittam paccavakkhitabbam_ “_dīgharattamidam cittam samkiliṭṭham ragena dosena mohenā_”_ti_. _Citta samkilesā bhikkhave sattā samkilssanti cittavodānā sattā visujjhanti_ (_Sam_.-2: 123; _Gaddulabaddha Suttan_).

Bhikkhûs --- When you are within the _Sāsanā_, often reflect on your mind and analyze the fact that “throughout day and night our minds are impure because they are tainted with _raga_, _dosa_, and _moha_.” Because of the impure minds, the sentient beings weary, tired and themselves are unpurified. The sentient beings of purified mind are

bright in themselves. (_Sam_.-2: 123; _Gaddulabaddha Suttan_).

The reason for instruction on such a frequent reflection is that the Lord wanted them to make effort on the exercise of _vipassanā bhāvanā_–the actual cause of mind purification. Such a frequent reflection would help purify the minds by concentrating on the three general characters of the five aggregates, which would otherwise create the

impure mind by these aggregates.

**CHANGE YOUR MIND IN CONSTRUCTIVE WAY**

Concentrate on the facts given above and purify your mind.

1. **_Niyamita_** – Fix your mind on doing _kusala_ meritorious deeds in your _samatha_, _vipassanā_ etc., as “I shall perform only the _kusala kamma_.”
1. **\*Pariṇāmita** –* Refraining from concentrating of *akusala dhamma*s like *lobha*, *dosa, moha*, conceit, *issā, micceriya* etc., in mind, but it is made prone to culture of *kusala dhamma*s, such as *samatha vipassanā\*, etc.
1. **_Sumudācāra_** – Always practice your miūd on _kusala_ *dhamma*s, such as _dāna_, _sīla, samatha, vipassanā, bhāvanā_ etc..
1. **_Ãbhujita_**

1) Reside in suitable places, the _patirûpa_ locale, where benevolent persons, or the Samaritan, prevails.
1) Approach and make friends with such persons.
1) Listen to the preaching of benevolent persons. ū
1) Cultivate all the Path Knowledge of the Noble ones starting from the Five Precepts that have to be fulfilled prior to attaining the Noble Path.
1) The three periods the past, the future and the present, the five-fold _uppādāna_- _kkhandhā_ within the internal and external _santāna_ = concentrate and take to heart the _rûpa_ and _nāma_ as _anicca_ (impermanence), _dukkha_ (suffering), _anatta_ (non-self) and _asubha_ (repulsive) repetitively. If contemplating this way, which- ever agreeable or disagreeable objects one may encounter, one would not be

 shaken, and it will always be meritorious deeds.

Build up your mind in this way. If built up this, your mind will gradually be purified. With such a gradually purified mind, your _bhava_ will become higher and higher, more and more glorified, higher deity and higher _brahmā_ with each existence. If the purification of mind has resulted in attaining Arahatta-Magga, then you will completely

be purified and will be delivered from all the worldly affairs.

If the mind yours has not been purified, but let it be overwhelmed by _lobha_, _dosa_, _moha_, conceit, _issa_, _miccheriya_ etc., then you’re your mind element will remain impure. If such a mind cannot be eradicated in time, it will not stand at _pariyuṭṭhānakilesā_ (posses sed by craving) state, but defilement and discontentment so high as to explode and your unbecoming behavior will influence all your speech and acts. This stage is called _vītkka-ma- kilesā_ (going beyond _kilesā_). Your moral will be broken. Meritorious deeds such as _dāna_ (alms-giving) will be of very inferior quality. The _dāna_ is made with good morality

will be as follows.

_Dānañhi loke sakkasampatti, deti mārasampattim cakkavuttisampattim sāvakapāramī-_

_ñāṇam paccekabodiñānam abhisambodhiñānam deti (Am.-ṭha_ – 3: 213).

In this _loka_, _dāna_ can result in one of wealth of the King Sakka, of Māra, of Brahmā, of _Cakkavaļa_ (universal king), in attainment of _sāvaka-pāramī-ñāṇa_ and of _pac_-_cekabodhi_- _ñāṇa_. _Abhisambodhi ñāṇa_ (knowledge of the highest enlightenment) = _ara_-

_hattamagga ñāṇa_ peaked by _sabbaññuta_ _ñāṇa_ can also be acquired (_Am.-ṭha_ – 3: 213).

The _dāna_ (charity/or donation), cultivated based on the _sīla_, can bring forth the wealth of a human king, of a deity, of a brahma and of Cakka on the donor if a wish has been so made. At certain, when the act of _dāna_ has matured to produce a result, the donor will enjoy the relevant results. If the donor has made a wish for a _bodhiñāṇa_ such as _aggasāvaka_- _bodhi_-_ñāṇa_ or _mahāsāvaka-bodhiñāṇa_ or _pakatisāva-bodhiñāṇa_ he would be duly endowed so. Even _pacceka-bodhiñāṇa_ can be acquired if it has been wished for. This donation will be of support in acquiring _sabbaññuta_-_ñāṇa_ (knowledge of omniscience) = _sammā- sambodhiñāṇa_ like the hermit Sumedhā and the king Vessanta-rā, if it has been the wish. Among the 10 *pārāmī*s (the ten perfections), _dāna_ is a part.

The power of _dāna_, therefore, is of great magnitude. ū

_Tañca kho sīlavato vadāmi_, _no dussīlassa_. _Acchati bhikkhave sīlavato cetopaṇidhi visuddhattā_ (*Am.-*3-71*. Dānûpapatti Suttana*). ū

I preach to only those with _sīla_ (morality) that the powerful _dāna_ give resultants of high quality, but not to those without such _sīla_. Bhikkûs ---- in those with _sīla_, their minds are clear because of the clear _sīla_, and whatever wishes they have in their minds

are definitely fulfilled (_Am._-3-71).

**HOW BRAHMA’S WEALTH CAN BE ACQUIRED**

With regard to the _dāna_ producing the wealth of Brahma, the following have been given in the texts.

_Tañca kho sīlavato vadāmi_, _no dussīlassa_. _Vitarāgassa_, _no tarāgassa_ (_Am._-3-72).\*

**\*Vitarāgassā**ti maggena vā samucchinnarāgassa sammāpattiyā vā vikkhambhi tarāgassa*. *Dāna matteneva hi brahmā-loke nibbattiton na sakkā*, *dānam pana sammādhivipassanā-\*

_cittassa alañkāraparivāram hoti_. _Tato dānena muducitto brahmavihāre bhāvattvā_

 _brahma-loke nibbattati_. _Tena vuttam “vitarāgassa_, _no sarāgassā”ti_ (_Am._- _ṭha_.- 3-230ū. ū

The _anāgāma_ (the never-returner) the noble one could eradicate the attachment on the various _rûpa_-_kamma_ material of living and non-living materials in (11) _rûpa_ planes

by virtue of _anāgāmi_-_magga_-_ñāṇa_. It is the _samuccheda_-_pahāna_ (a way of abandoning through full understanding of the noble truth of suffering and its ceasing). The noble ones such as the worldling with high morality, _sotapanna_ (the up-streamer), _sagadāgāmi_ (once- returner), can detach themselves for a considerable duration of time from these _karma_-_rāga_ through the power of absorption or trance = this is the way of detachment by

_vikkhambhana_.

The Buddha expatiated that the wealth of brahma king can be acquired only by those possessed of _sīla_, and relieved of raga by way of _samuccheda_ and _vikkhambhana_. In those with _sīla_, their minds are clear because of the clear _sīla_, and whatever wishes they have in their minds are completely fulfilled. What it means is that _dāna_ alone could not help acquire the life in byahma world. It, however, can be the features of _samaṭṭha bhāvanā-citta and vipassanā bhāvanā-citta_ referred to as _samādhi_ (concentration). By performing _dāna_ one’s mind becomes softened. And if the _byama_-_vihāra_ (the 4 sublime states) of _mettā_, _karuṇā_, _muditā_ and _uppekkhā_ = the 4-fold _byamacora_, can be acquired, then this _jhāna dhamma_ will enable one to relieve himself of _rāga_ etc., the _ṇīvaran_ impurities by virtue of _vikkhambhana_. Because of the _raga_-free _byama_-_vihāra_ _jhāna_, he can attain an existence in the byahma world. Therefore, I only preach to the “one free of _raga_ the way of attaining an existence in the byahma world; but to the one who is not

freed of _rāga_” (_Am._- _ṭha_.- 3-230).

If such highly _dāna_ cannot be made based on the _sīla_, then there can be no higher resultants, instead only inferior results can be obtained from such a _dāna_. With reference

to this assertion, read the following _Aṇusoṇi-suttanna_.

**_AṇUSOṇI SUTTANA_**

Then _Jānusoṇi_, the royal astrologer of the King Bembisāra, approached, had a memorable talk with the Buddha and took a seat at an appropriate location and said to the Lord.

My Lord Gotama --- we humble *puṇṇa*s made _dāna_ with the intention that “this donation would reach our relatives who have passed away, and that they be able to utilize its benefit.” We made kumbi-rice in remembrance of them. My Lord Gotama ---- would

our donation reach our relatives and could they enjoy these?

The Buddha replied. Donor *puṇṇa*s ---- it arrives at places where it should, but not at places where it should not.

My Lord Gotama, asked the *puṇṇa*s ---

1. What is the place where it should arrive and
1. That where it should not?

1) In this _loka_ some people used to take the life of other living beings, some take what is not given, indulged in adultery, tell lies, slander, speak harsh (impolite) speech, frivolous and senseless talk, covetousness, malevolence and practiced _micchādiṭṭhi_ (wrong view) doctrine. After ageing, death and decay the person would attain a life in the world of misery. He has to share the food meant for the being of that world. He has to live on such food lead an existence in that world. This is the place where the benefit of _dāna_ could not reach, and the that individual of the miserable world could not enjoy the result

of that _dāna_.

[**\*Nerayikānam āhāro nāma** tattha nibbattanakammameva*. *Teneva hi te tattha yā panti* ((*Am.*- *ṭṭa*.- 3-338). The *āhāra\* of those in the miserable world is that which is

 made available in that world. They have to share such _āhāra_ among themselves.]

2. Dāyakā (donor) _puṇṇa_ --- in this world there some who take other’s life. R. They have the wrong of view of _micchādiṭṭi_. After death and decay, he would attain an existence in animal world, sharing feeds with other animals. He has to remain as an animal in the same world. Then this still is not yet the place where _dhāna_ could arrive at.

It would reach those existing as animal in an animal world.

[***Tiracchānayonikānam** pana tiṇṇapaṇṇādivasena āhāro veditabbo* (*Sam*.- *ṭha*.- 3: 338). The food of animals is made of grass vegetables.]

3. Dāyakā _puṇṇa_ --- In this _loka_ some abstain from taking life, from taking what is not given, from indulging in adultery, from telling lies, from slander, from speaking harsh speech, from frivolous and senseless talk, from covetousness, from malevolence and from practicing _micchādiṭṭhi_ doctrine. They are relieved of _abhicchā_ (frugality) and of intention to destroy sentient beings and _sañkhāra_, has the right view (_sammādiṭṭhi_). When such a person succumb to death and decay, he would acquire human life. He would have the _āhāra_ like other humans leading a life as a human being. This is still not a place for _dāna_ to reach nor could he, as a human being, could enjoy the results of

that _dāna_.

4. Dāyakā _puṇṇa_ --- In this _loka_ some abstain from taking life. R. He possesses _samm_- _ādiṭṭhi_ view. After death and decay, he would acquire a deity’s existence. He co-exists with the deities living on the food of gods (_sudhā_). Again this neither the right place to

which the results of _dāna_ could arrive at nor the person who could enjoy the result. ū

5. Dāyakā _puṇṇa_ --- In this _loka_ some abstain from taking life. R. He possesses _samm_- _ādiṭṭhi_ view. After death and decay, he would acquire a (_peta_’s) life in _peta_’s realm. He would co-exist with other _peta_’s living on their nutrition, or on the _dāna_ given by his relatives and the loved ones for his own benefit. Dāyakā _puṇṇa_ --- This the right place to which benefits of _dāna_ would reach, and person who could enjoy the results. [**\*Pettivesayikānam** khe*3*asañghāṇikādivasena\*. **\*Yam vā panassa ito anuppavacchantī**ti yam tassa mittādayo ito dadantā anupavesañti*, *pettivesdanikā ve hi paradattûpajīvino\*

_hunti_, _na aññesam parehi uppakappati_ (_Sam_.-_ṭha_.- 3: 338 - 339). ū

The nutrition of the *petā*s, in fact, are human refuse. If their loved ones have made a _dāna_ for their sake, then they would enjoy it as if it were that of deities. These *petā*s are of _paradattûpajīvita_ ( living on what is given by others) kind. Others such as _nicchāmādahṇika_ could not enjoy the result of such _dāna_. Then the _dāna_ cannot reach to

such *peta*s.]

Then the _puṇṇa_ once again enquired. My Lord Gotama ---- If that _dāna_ failed to reach to such *peta*s, then who would enjoy the benefit of that _dāna_?

The Lord Gotama replied. Dāyakā _puṇṇa_ --- To the relatives who have attained the *peta*s’ existence in their realm.

If our relatives and others who have, after death and decay, do not reach the _petā_’s realm who would enjoy the results of our _dāna_?

Dāyakā _puṇṇa_ --- During the long journey through the sansāric circus, reaching or not reaching the _petā_’s realm is not an important fact. In other words (**_Apīca byahma-_**

**_ṇa dāyakopi anipphaloti_**) = the donor, indeed, cannot be without benefit.

[**\*Dāyakopi anipphalo**ti yam sandhāya tam dānam dannam*, *tassa upakappatu vā mā vā*, *dāyakena pana na sakkā nipphalena bhavitom*, *dāyako tassa dānassa vipākam labhatiyeva* (*Sam*.-*ṭha*.- 3: 338 - 339). What is meant by the fact that the donor is not without benefit is that a *dāna\* that was made for the benefit of those who have perished

away may or may not reach them, the donor still enjoys the results of _dāna_].

The _puṇṇa_ enquired of the Buddha … “If the death ones acquired a life at a realm where the results of the _dāna_ could not arrive at, do you my Lord Gotama still

recommend the benefit of the _dāna_?”

Yes Dāyakā _Byamana_ --- I do.

[The _Byamana_ seems to be under the impression that “the _dāna_ made for the benefit of those who have passed away could not be enjoyed by the donor himself. The Lord agreed with _puṇṇa_ and expounded in continuation that “if the donor happens to acquire a life where one can enjoy the results of _dāna_, then he can enjoy the benefit the

_dāna_ (_Sam_.-_ṭha_.- 3: 338 - 339)].

1. Dāyakā …. In this world, there are some who used to take other’s life, take what is

not given, indulge in *karma*s, tell lies, gossip, make harsh speak, frivolous talks. They are attached to living and non-living karma materials of the others, have the mind

set on destroying sentient beings, and practice _micchādiṭṭhi vāda_.

He is used to offer foods, soft drinks, clothes, vehicle, flowers, scents, place to sleep and light to _samaṇa_ or _brāhmaṇa_.

After death and decay, he acquired the life of an elephant. In that life he could enjoy food, flowers and special decoration meant for elephants.

Dāyakā …. In this existence, taking other’s life, taking what is not given, indulging in *karma*s, lying, gossiping, making harsh speak, frivolous talks, being attached to living and non-living karma materials of the others, have the mind set on destroying

sentient beings, and practice _micchādiṭṭhi vāda_, would result in him acquiring the life an elephant.

Because of offering foods, soft drinks, clothes, vehicle, flowers, scents, place to sleep and light to _samaṇa_ or _brāhmaṇa_, that person would enjoy the foods, flowers and special decoration meant for elephants.

2. Dāyakā _puṇṇa_ …. In this world, there are some who used to take other’s life. R.

He is used to offer foods, soft drinks, clothes, vehicle, flowers, scents, place to sleep

and light to _samaṇa_ or _brāhmaṇa_.

 After death and decay, he acquired the life of a horse. R.

3. After death and decay, he acquired the life of a cow. R.
4. He acquired the life of a dog after death and decay,. R.

Dāyakā _Byamana_ …. due to taking other’s life in this existence, R, and practice _micchādiṭṭhi vāda_, he would acquire an existence as (a horse, a cow) and a dog.

Because of offering foods, clothes, vehicles, flowers scent and comfortable sleeping place and light to the *samaṇa*s or *brāhmaṇa*s, he could enjoy the life of (a horse, a cow) a dog with foods and decorations.

[N.B. The _Suttana_ has not ended yet, but is paused for a while to explain its meaning so far. As explained above, the power of _dāna_ made on the basis of _sīla_, could provide the donor with comforts of human kings, of deities, of brāhma and cakkavade; the _eggasāvaka bodhi ñāṇa_, _mahāsāvaka bodhi ñāṇa_, _pakatisāvaka ñāṇa_, _pacceka bodhi ñāṇa_, or _sammāsambodhi ñāṇa_. The power of such a magnitude is resulting at the right place at the right time. In the present section (_suttāna_ so far), the power of _dāna_ made on the basis of _ducarita_ (misbehavior), referred to as damaged _sīla_, could not provide wealth as above nor the higher *ñāṇa*s. Instead, the _dāna_’s results made their appearance in the wrong place like

the lower world of sentient beings. Though they can enjoy the life of graceful elephant or horse or higher status cow, but not the comfort enjoyed by human kings, deities, brāhma. And the nutrition consumed by such beings are just the _tiṇapṇṇā-divasena_ – vegetables as mentioned in _Aṭṭhakathā_. Such food, when compared to that of human kings, deities, brāhma, are of very inferior quality. As a dog, it can sleep on good gunny bag like a mattress, and can have good food, it has live in an abode suitable for a dog. The food may be good for a dog, but has to live in places lower than human kings etc. As the village pigs like human organic refuse so do the dogs. For this reason, the donor who has acquired an animal’s life, the food they eat and place they live may be of higher status for animals. But this situation could not be compared to those of human kings, deities etc. The animals have to contend with grass and other vegetables as their food, and ground as their living places. This is an instance of _dāna_ resulting in the wrong place, a result that can be enjoyed by immoral personalities. Care should be exercised on these situations. Then the Buddha continued expatiation for the _Jāṇusoṇipoṇṇa_ as given

below.]

5. Dāyakā _Byamana_ …. In this life some abstain from taking other’s life. R. Practice a _sammādiṭṭhi vāda_ (the doctrine of the right view). He would offer as donation the foods, clothes, vehicles, flowers scent and comfortable sleeping place and light to the *samaṇa*s or *brāhmaṇa*s. After death and decay, he would attain the plane of human beings, and as

a human he would possess the five-fold clinging to the corporeality.

Dāyakā _Byamana_ …. He is possessed of the five-fold clinging to the corporeality because of attaining a human life, after death and decay, as a result of

abstaining from taking other’s life and practicing a _sammādhiṭṭhi vāda_. ū

[_So tam cittam dahati_, _tam cittam adhiṭṭhāti_,_tam cittam bhāveti_. _Tassa tam cittam hīne vimuttam uttari abhāvitam tattarûpapattiyā samvuttati_ (_Am_.-3: 71).

That donor of morality has mind set on becoming a rich king or a rich _puṇṇa_ or a rich Gahapati and has his mind cultivated in that way. He concentrated his mind on that wish repetitively. His mind leaning towards the five-fold clinging to the corporeality, his failure to concentrate on attaining the _magga_, _phala_, _nibbāna_, higher than the above five,

on the, are the causes that have resulted in rebirth among the beings he had wished for.

Note that the same applies to attaining the deity’s _bhava_, etc.]

6. Dāyakā _Byamana_ …. In this life some abstain from taking other’s life. R. Practice a _sammādiṭṭhi vāda_ (the doctrine of the right view). He would offer as donation the foods, clothes, vehicles, flowers scent and comfortable sleeping place and light to the *samaṇa*s or *brāhmaṇa*s. After death and decay, he would attain the realm of deities, and as a deity

he would possess the five-fold clinging to the corporeality.

Dāyakā _Byamana_ …. He is possessed of the five-fold clinging to the corporeality because of attaining a deity’s life, after death and decay, as a result of

abstaining from taking other’s life and practicing a _sammādhiṭṭhi vāda_.

Dāyakā _Byamana_ …. Indeed the donor cannot be without merit, he does enjoy the benefit the _dāna_, the Lord replied.

The _Jāṇusoṇipoṇṇa_ declared as:

My Lord Gotama …. It is wonderful. It has never occurred in me before.

My Lord Gotama …. Since the donor is not without benefit, one should offer dāna. Kubbhi rice (= to give alms with intended benefit for the death) is worth making.

Dāyakā _Byamana_ …. So it is, and so it should be.

Dāyakā _Byamana_ …. The donor will never be without benefit. The Buddha

expounded.

My Lord Gotama …. Your explanatory *dhamma*s are very beautifully put to me. If I may compare your *dhamma*s to worldly affairs, it is like putting something right that has been upside down, like lifting the lid of post, showing the right way to one who has lost his way, like giving light to people “of good vision expecting to visualized material features,” groping in the dark. You have explained competently with many an examples.

My Lord Gotama …. we take refuge in You, in your *dhamma*s, referred to as the 10-fold Magga-Phala-Nibbāna-Dammakkhan, and in Eight Noble Sanghās. I humbly request that I be recognized as an Upāsakā and a Dāyakā who respects and pay homage to the Three-

fold _Yatanā_ from now on until my death (_Am_.-3:478 – 482).

**A FEW EXCEPTIONS**

The donor must be complete with the following four-fold features:

1. _Dussīla_ = person without morality
1. Material donated were obtained by illegal means
1. With clear mind
1. No belief in the broad and higher *dhamma*s of kamma-and-its-effect

But the person of receiving end must have the following feature:

5. Person of high morality.

Such a kind of _dāna_ is also clean because of the morally high receiving person, and is of great benefit as expounded by the Buddha in _Dakkhiṇavibañga Suttāna_ (_Ma_.-3:300).

The _Aṭṭhakathā_ has depicted a fisherman living at the mouth of River _Kalyāṇī_ as an example. The fisherman has offered alms to Dīghasoma Mathera for three times. At the moment of death consciousness, he had the _Maraṇāsanna jhāna_ (impulsion of near-death) of that alms-giving, declared “I have been relieved of miserable world, that could

have resulted from the _akusala_-_kamma_, just before he succumbs to death (_Ma_.-3:227).

These are just few instances of exception. Because of the receiving person being an individual of clean sīla, like the Rahntā Matheras, having immense _guṇa_, and which has the chance to provide result, that the fisherman was relieved of _apāya_. Though the previous cause has given result, that _kamma_ (action) has been surrounded by fore and aft,

it is a _kamma_ of inferior quality. This kind of chance, however, is hard to come by. Until the time when that _kamma_ is matured and has the time produce results, the _āciṇṇa_ _kamma_ (chronic _kamma_) killing fish by fisherman would have a better chance to provide

its results.

You as gentleman should culture clean and high element of mind:

1. If you wish to be delivered from the _apāya_,
1. If you wish to lead the life of a high status human, deity and brāhma,
1. If you wish to be relieved of sufferings of sansāric circus.

_Sabbapāpassa akaraṇam_, _kusalassa upasampadā_. _Sacittapariyodapanam_, _etam buddhānasāsanam_ (_Dī_.-2:42).\*

1. Abstain from doing _akusala_ (non-meritorious deeds) _kamma_.
1. Make every effort to perform _kusala_ (meritorious) _kamma_.
1. Make clean your mind (or consciousness) by washing stepwise in _magga_ and _phala_ cleaners.

These are admonitions (axioms) provided by all Buddhas (_Dī_.-2:42). Translated by KMA, Mandalay.

SECTIONS ON _IRIYāPAūHA_ AND _SAMPAJAÑ_ MEDITATION BY _IRIYāPATHA_ AND _SAMPAJAÑÑA_ ū

In the section on _rûpa_-_kammaṭṭhāna_, contemplation of corporeal _iriyāpatha_ and of _sampajañña_ have been mentioned. In the present section _nāma kammaṭṭhāna_ mention will be made of concentration the fivefold _khandhā_ (clinging aggregates). Before going on to this section, the reader is advised to understand, reflect and concentrate on explanations given in _rûpa_-_kammaṭṭhāna_. Only then will deep realization and

contemplation be made ūn _nāma kammaṭṭhāna_.

**THE FOUR KINDS OF _RÛPA_-_KāYA_** ū

 _Tattha catubbidho kāyo upādinnako āhārasamuṭṭhāno utusamuuṭṭhāno cittaṭṭhānoti_. _Tattha cakkhāyatnādīni jīvitindariyapariyantāni aṭṭha kammasamuṭṭhānarûpānīpi_, _kammasamuṭṭhānāneva catasso dhātuyo vuṇṇo gandho raso ojāti aṭṭha **upādinnakakāyo** nāma_. _Tā neva aṭṭha āhārajāni **āhārasamuṭṭhānikakāyo** nāma_. _Aṭṭha utujāni **utusamuuṭṭhānikakāyo** nāma_, _aṭṭha cittajāni **cittasamuṭṭhānikakāyo** nāma_ (_Abhi_.- _ṭha_.- 1:124).

1. **_Upādinnakakāya_ –** _kamma_-_samuṭṭhāna_ (_kamma_-caused) modes of eight kindsūūūū

_cakkhāyatana, sotāyatana_, _ghānāyatna_, _jīvhāyatana_, _kāyāyatana_, _itthibhāva-rûpa_, _pûrisabhāvarûpa_, _and jīvitindare_ (9 kinds if _hadayavutthu_ is also included), and the eight modes of _rûpa_ such as *pathav*ī, _āpo_, _tejo_, _vāyo_, _vuṇṇa_, _gandha_, _rasa_ and _ojā_, also _kamma_- _samuṭṭhāna_, are said to be **_Upādinnakakāya_.** [It means that the _kamma_ “I, My

benefit” associated with or surrounded by _taṇhā-diṭṭhū_.]

2. **_Ãhārasamuṭṭhānikakāya_** – The eight modes of _rûpa_ such as _pathavī_, _āpo_, _tejo_,\* _vāyo_,_vuṇṇa_, _gandha_, _rasa_ and _ojā_, are said to be **_Ãhārasamuṭṭhānikakāya_**.
3. **_Cittasamuṭṭhānikakāya_** –** If the above eight modes are _citta_-derived ones, then they  
   \***
    are said to be **_cittasamuṭṭhānikūkāya_**. ūūūūū

[Note – Theūdescriptions above are for _Rûpa_-_kāya_ = the ever occurring in _khandhā_ called _rûpa-rûpa_, all caused bythe four dhammas including _kamma_ etc., the true *rûpa*s. The sadda-rûpa which occur once in a while, and the _nipphanna_-_rûpa_ which are

not true *rûpa*s areūnot inclusive.]

**THE _KāYAVIÑÑATA-RÛPA_** ūūū

In this _iriyāpatha_ and _sampajañña_ contemplations, understanding of _kayaviññata_- _rûpa_ is a pre-rerquisite. In the previous section on _rûpakamaṭṭhāna_ detail explation on the _viññata-rûpa_ has been made. For the sake of rememberance it will be touched upon

again in brief. ūūūū

Whūt is _kāyaviññata_-_rûpa_? It is the _rûpa_ referred to as the _kayaviññata_. There is dhamma rooted in _kusala_-_citta_, _akusala_-_citta_, _abyākata_-_citta_, and of individuals of advancing or retreating, of seeing straight ahead or sideways, of flexing or extending legs, _rûpa_-*kāya dhamma*s = supporting all _rûpa_ dhamma, the cause of such a support

_rûpa_, that which makes one realises (_Abhi_.- 1: 177). ūūūūūū

If consciousness arsies in one as “I will go forward, or backward,” it is the cause of arising of the _cittaja_-_rûpa_ (a multitude of _cittaja_-_kalāpa_). Each and every _kalāpa_ has the four great elements: _pathavī_, _āpo_, _tejo,vāyo_. Among these are included the four great element-depended _vuṇṇa_, _gandha_, _rasa_ and _ojā_, called _upādāna rûpa_, and also the eight modes of the _rûpa dhamma_. Included also in these *rûpa dhamma*s is _cittasamuṭṭhāna vāyo dhātu_. This _vāyo dhātu_ with _upādinnakāya_, _āhārasamuṭṭhāni kāya_, _utusamuṭṭhānikāya_, _cittasamuṭṭhānikāya_, which are the *rûpa-kāya*s = _all the rûpa dhammas_ formed together* within a *khandhā\*, provide good support, and cause

movements forward or backward (_Abhi_.- _ṭha_ 1: 124). ū

Among the _cittaja vāyo dhātu_, arising from that _citta_, are _manodvārika-jhāna-vīthi_ with a certain _āvajjana_ of the seven *javana*s. Of these seven, _vāyo-dhātu_ formed of the first _javana_-_citta_ has ability to support, maintain and hold firmly _catuja-rûpa-kāya_. It is, therefore unable move this way or that. Note that the same hold true for second

_jhāna_ and so on. ūūū

The _vāyo dhātu_ contained in _cittaja rûpa_ *kalāpa*s caused by seventh _javana-citta_ formed previously = included in the 6-fold prior _jhāna-citta_ derived _cittaja rûpa_ *kalāpa*s produces supportive _upatthambhana_ cause. Because of this support, it can provide good support to _catuja-rûpa-kāya_ of similar nature = for the purpose of propping up, good and firm maintenance, of movement, of moving to and fro, of looking straight ahead, of glancing sideways, flexing and extending. Because of the 7th _jhāna-citta_-derived _vāyo_-

_dhātu_, the following can exclaimed to have attained.

 Going forward,

 Turning back,

 Going and coming back. ūū

To havū traveled a distance of one _yûjanā_ To have traveled a distance of ten _yûjanā_. ūūūū

The *rûpa dhamma*s once arisen, as _uppāda_, at place is never removed to another one. The life span of a _rûpa dhamma_ only 17 *citta khana*s (thought moment), so short a duration that it perishes away at the place of arising. The movement here means the arising a _rûpa- kalāpa_ at one place and arising once again in another. It is not the movement of _rûpa_-_kalāpa_ per se from one place to another. Arsing in another place is by virtue of the _vāyo dhātu_ included among the _cittaja_-_rûpa_ _dhātu_. People take _uppāda_

shifting from one place to another as “movemenū.” ūū

The _vāyo dhātu_ contained in the _cittaja_-*rûpa-kalāpa*s, derived from the first _javana- citta_, in fact, cannot move at the moment of arising as a cause for _catuja-rûpa at_ a certain other place.ū However immovable it mat be, it must be noted that the _vāyo dhātu_ arises together with the _vikāra_-_rûpa_ called _viññatta_. (It means that it formed as _kāyaviññattinavaka kalāpa_, _kāyaviññattinavaka-lahuta dvidvādasaka kalāpa_). ūū

The reason is this. Of the 10 directions, you woulū like to go to certain direction, or to put a cerainūthing, to flex or extend, then the _vāyo dhātu_ would well support and maintaūn the _catuja_-_rûpa,_ which are bearing direction. Therefore, the feature of being directed to a particular place is there, a distinct feature arising together with your internal state of mind *chanda*ū= the _vikāra_ is also a form of _viññatta_. Note, therefore, thaū among the first javana- derived _cittaja-rûpa_-_kalāpa_, _vāyo dhātu_ is formed together with _vikāra_-_rûpa_, called _viññatta_.

Because of this, the appearance aūso of _viññatta-rûpa_ by the _manodvāra_ form the distinct _vikāra_-_rûpa_ according to ūhe internal _chanda_ (the particularly distinct _vikāra_-_rûpa_ in accordance with the _chanda_). Because of this possibility of formation of _vuṭṭho_, _karma_- _javana_, _abhiññāna_-_jhāna_, the 32 modes of *citta*s as strengthening the _cittaja_-_sāmañña_-_rûpa_, as well as the _iriyaputta_ and the appearance of _viññatta-rûpa_.

Among the inumerablū _cittaja_-_rûpa_-_kalāpa_ that ūave arisen, the ūvāyo*-*dhātu* couldbe claimed to have a plūce 10 *yûjanā*s away (*Mulaṭī\*.- 1: 72). ūūū

Among the _catuja rûpa_-_kāya_ = _catusamuṭṭhānika rûpa-kāya_ = the *rûpa-kāya*s are present all the _cittaja_-*rûpa*s referred to asū*cittajasamuṭṭhānika kāya*,ūbut are not the _viññatta_. As a matter of fact, for supporting the among the _citta_-caused _catuja rûpa_-_kāya_ formed together with _vāyo dhātu_, included in the *cittajasamuṭṭhāni rûpa-kalāpa*s, = for firm prop, strong maintenance, moving here and there, which can be the causes, there is present a certain feature of _citta_-derived _mahābhûta_ (the four great primaries) _cittajasamuṭṭhāna_. This distinct feature is the **_viññatta_** (_Abhi_.- _ṭha._ 1: 125).

Note that it is true tūat because of the possession of such distinct featuūe, the _vāyo_ _dhātu_, formed together with _catuja rûpa_-_kāya_ = all the *rûpa*s, can support and move (_Mahāṭī_.- 1: 72).

*Cittaja-aṭṭhakalāpa rûpa*s arises due to citta, but not the _viññatta_-_rûpa_. (Because it is not the true _paramatta_). In this way, _sañkhāra paramatta dhammas_, though not the _cittajasamuṭṭhāna_ the _citta_-derivatives, have the nature of _anicca_ (impermanence), _dukkha_ (suffering) and _anatta_ (non-self), and are subject to _jarā_-_mara_ (ageing and death).

**_Jarū-Maraṇam bhikkhave aniccam sañkhatam_** (_Sam_.-1: 264) ūū

Bhikkhûs … _Jarā_-_maraṇa_ is an _anicca dhamma_ (phenomenon of impermanence); its causes are the _sañkhata dhamma_ subject to change. Besides, the _vikāra_, referred to as _viññatta_, which can realize the _cittaja_-_rûpa_, and which are the _cittajasamuṭṭhāna_ = having a particular behavior _viññatta_-_rûpa_ also is _citta_-caused _cittajasamuṭṭhāna_ (_Abhi_.-\*

_ṭha._ 2: 125). ūūū

**_ṭhānupacā_**. From the _Aṭṭhakathā_ descriptions, the _cittajasamuṭṭhāna_ the true name, of the eight modes of the _kalāpa_-_rûpa_, has been emphasized on the basis of _vikāra_-_rûpa_ _viññatta_, and is also _cittajasamuṭṭhāna_. For thiū reason, that _viññatta rûpa_ has to be\*

named as the _cittajasamuṭṭhāna_ by way of an explanation inserting as _nāma saddā_ hence the expression “**_Sāpi cittasamuṭṭhānā nāma hoti_** (_Abhi_.- _ṭha._ 2: 125). For the purpose of making clear that there, however, is no _viññatta_-_rûpa_ in _paramatta_ sense. This is

explained to be “ **_Na cittasamuṭṭhānā._**” ūūū

 From aspect of the _ṭhānupacāra_ the _viññatta_-_rûpa_ is the _cittajasamuṭṭhāna_ and is also _upādā rûpa_ from aspect of the four-fold _mahābhûta_ = because of being _vikāra_ by

way of _ṭhānupacāra_ (_Mahāṭī_.-1: 72). ūū

As explained previously in section on _rûpa_-_kammūṭṭhānā_, two *rûpa*s in this _iriya_- _patha_ and _sampajañña_ are given below.

1. **_Padhāna_** (essential) = the concentrated *rûpa dhamma*s are the _kāya_-_viññaūti navaka kalāpa_

and _kāya_-_viññatti-lahutā dvidvādasaka kalāpa_ which the two kinds of _cittaja_-_rûpa_ ūū

_kalāpa_ in which is included the _viññatta_. _Bhasite_ – _sampajañña_ meditation are two *rûpa kalāpa*s: _vacīiññatti_-_daska kalāpa_ and _vacīiññatti sadda-lahutāditerasaka kalāpa_, included in the _vacīññatta rûpa,_ which made their appearance because of consciousness

on point of wish to make while talking. ū

2.ū**_Appadhāna_** (noneūsential) = *apadhāna rûpa dhamma*s are _catusamuṭṭhānika_

_rûpa-kāya =_ all the *rûpaū *dhamma*s located inūthe six *dvāra*s and the 42 *kuṭṭhāsa* (the bodilū parts) of the body (*Ma*.- *ṭī.-\* 3ū3). ūū

1. Among these _padhāna_-_rûūa_ and _apadhāna_-_rûpa_, a meditator concentrates primarily on the *rûpa dhamma*s inclusive of _viññatta rûpa_ referred to as _iriyapaṭha-rûpa_. If he did so, the _catusamuṭṭhānika rûpa-kāya_ located in the *dvāra*s and the 42 _kuṭhāsa_, which are

the _appadhāna_ = all the *rûpa dhamma*s too are ūompletely cultured. ūūūūū

2. _Appadhāna_. Non-concentrated _samuṭṭhānika rûpa-kāya_, located in the six *dvāra*s and the 42 _kuṭhāsa_, = contemplation on all *rûpa dhamma*s as the primary objects, also _iriya_-_paṭṭha- rûpa_, the _appadhāna_ are accomplished consecutively. Later, _samuṭṭhānika rûpa-kāya_ is the _padhāna_, _iriyapaṭha-rûpa_ = *cittaja rûpa*s which contain _viññatta_, are the

 _appadhāna_ (_Ma_.- _ṭī.-_ 353ū. ūū

All these _padūāna_, *appadhāna rûpa dhamma*s are called the _rûpa_-_kkhandhā_. The meditator must have cultured all these to the attainment of realizing their _paramatta_ ( the ultimate truth). Only then can the attainment of *nāma dhamma*s be cultured. For the sake of relationship concentrations on the _rûpa_ and *nāma dhamma*s, a brief description of

that on the *rûpa dhamm*a, that hasūbeen broadly explained previously, will be made.

**THE FIVE-FOLD _KHANDDHā_** = **_RÛPA_ + 2 MODES OF _NāMA_** (The Five Aggregates = Corporeality + 2 Mental States) ū

“_Gicchāmī_”_ti cittam uppajjati_, _tam vāyam janeti_, _vāyam janeti_, _citta-kiriya vāyodhātu- vipphārena-sakalakāyassa pûrato abhinīhāro gamananti vuccati_. _Thānādīsupi eseva_

_nayo_ (_Ma_.- _ṭha._- 1: 256). ū

**\*Vāyam janetī**ti vāyo-dhātu-adhikam rûpa-kalapam janeti* (*Ma*.- *ṭha.\*- 1: 352). ūūūūūū

A _citta_ willing to go arises, which causes arising of a _vāyo_-_dhātu_ = resulting in in a _rûpa_-_kalāpa_ under influence of natural power natural power = causes arising of all the *rûpa dhamma*s. This _vāyo_-_dhātu_ causes arsing of _viññatta_-_rûpa_.. because of the spread throughout the entire body of the _vāyo_-_dhātu_ caused by _citta_, in other words, due to spread throughout the entire body of the citta-caused natural power overwhelmed by *rûpa dhamma*s, complete _sammuṭṭhāna rûpa_-_kāya_ = all *rûpa-dhamma*s are carried forwards.

The same applies to their stoppage etc.* (*Ma*.- *ṭha.\*- 1: 256).

You are advised to carefully read the descriptions in the above _Aṭṭhakathā_.
ūū

1. To begin with, the will to go should be concentrated to realize by eye of wisdom.
1. Concentration should be made to visualize, by eye of wisdom, on the complete _rûpa_- _kalāpa_ overwhelmed by _vāyo-dhātu_ caused by _citta_ of will to go = spreading throughout the entire body of all the _rûpa_-*dhamma*s should be realized via the eye of wisdom.
1. Natuūal power-dominated _vāyo_-_dhātu_, i.e., the natural power-dominated

_mahābhûta dhātu_ causing the body behavior at will in going should be

contemplated to visualize by eye of wisūom. ūū

4. Visualization by eye of wisdom of _rûpa dhammas_, being carried forward – spread throughout the entire body – of _rûpa_-*kalāpa*s and *rûpa dhamma*s dominated by

 natural power of _citta_-produced _vāyo_-_dhātu_, should be made.

Stated in a different way –  
ūū

1. Meditate on the mind to go by eye of wisdom. ūū
1. Concentrate, by eye of wisdom, all the citta-produced _kāya_-_viññatti navaka kalāpa_, _kāya-viññatti-lahuta-dvidvādasaka kalāpa_ spread throughout the entire body and the way they spread. These are the *rûpa*s that can spread, the _padhāna_ = the concentrated *rûpa*s.
1. Contemplate, to realize bū eye of wisdom, the *catusamuṭṭānika rûpa-kāya dhamma*s located in the six *dvāra*s and 42 _kuṭṭāsa_. They are _appadhāna_ = *rûpa*s

 (non-concentrated *rûpa*s).

**THE CITTA TO MOVE**

The _manodvāra_-_vijjana_, _kāmāvacara kusala_-_jh a_ and _askulasala jhāna_ are theūcitta for _puthujana_ and _sekkha_ _puggala_ to move. The noble _sekkha_ individuals must eradicate all the kilesā from which he has been relieved of. Such *citta*s are just

the _manodvārika jhāna vīthi citta_, which causes arising of _iriyapaṭṭha viññatta rûpa_.

It is the nature of citta that it never arises without accompaniment of _cetasika_. It always arises in association with relevant _cetasika_.

_Yassa viññānam pākaṭam hoti, so “na kevalam viññānemeva uppajjati_, _tena saddhim tadevarammanam phussamāto phassopi uppajjati_, _anubhavamānā vedanāpi_,

_sañjānanamāna saññāpi_, _cetayamānā cetanāpi uppajjatī”ti phassa-pañcamakeyeva pariggannhāti_ (_Ma_.- _ṭha._- 1: 280 – 281).

In concord with explanations of the above _Aṭṭhakathā_, _citta_-_viññāna_ does not arise just by itself alone. It being so, _nāma dhamma_ groups, led by _phassapañcamaka dhamma_ which appear together within _citta_-_viññāna_ and a _cittakhaṇa_, must be cultured and analyzed by _ñāṇa_. These _nāma_ groups also arise along the usual natural thought processes, called the _citta_-_niyāma_ (the way the mind works). Therefore,

they are series of _manodvārikū_-_javana_-_citta_ processes exeūted by mind to go. ū

The above-mentioned *padhāna rûpa dhamma*s and the _appadhāna rûpa_ *dhamma*s are the **_rûpa_**.

\2. _Citūa_-_cetasika_ willing to move are the **_nāma_.**

These _rûpa_ and _nāma_ are to be contemplated.

Amongūthese again the follūwing are the five-fold *khandhā*s:

1. _Rûpa dhamma_ is the _rûpa_-_kkhandhā_.
1. _Vedanā_ is the _vedanā_-_kkhandhā_.
1. _Saññā_ is the _saññā- kkhandhā_.
1. Except _vedanā_ and _saññā_, others are _sañkhāra-kkhandhā_.
1. Consciousness is the _viññāna_-_kkhandhā_.

Make effort to concentrate analytically to realize by eye of wisdom that there are five- fold *khandhā*s each in the _manodvāra_-_vhāna_ and _jhāna_. [With the exception of *vedanā* and *saññā*, all the *cetasika*s are the *sañkhāra*-*kkhandhā*, so that number in the *cetasika* of *sañkhāra*-*kkhandhā* fluctuates corresponding to that of cetasika that arises in with every *citta*- *khaṇa*. *Manodvāra*-*jhāna* is made of *citta* + *cetasika* (mind + mental concomitants) = 12 modes of *nāma dhamma*s, for which the remaining nine *cetasika*s are the *sañkhāra*- *kkhandhā*. If the *javana* is the *kusala*-*javana*, then – and there are 34 modes of *nāma* – then 31 *cetasika*s, exclusive of *vedanā*, s*aññā* and *viññāṇa*, are the *sañkhara*-*kkhandhā*s. This should clearly be understood.]

**METHOD OF MEDITATION IN BRIEF**
ū

1. Stand still at a certain place cultivate _samādhi_ (concentration) step by step.
1. Culture all the massive *rûpa dhamma*s, of the six *dvāra*s the 42 _kuṭṭhāsa_, by analytically breaking them down by your _ñāṇa_ to the attainment realization of their _paramatta_ by eye of wisdom. Then
1. Maintain by cultivation clear mind and body. ū
1. Make effort ot visualize the mind to move by making an attempt at it. concentrate to realize the _cetasūka_ associated with this mind.ū Concentrate to the stage of realization by eye of wisdom following the _mano-dvārika-jhāna-vīthi_. ūū
1. Concentrate primarily on spreading throughout the entire body of *Rûpa dhamma*s,* called *kāya-viññatti-navaka-kalāpa* and *kāyaviññatti-lahuta-dvidvāsaka kalāpa\*. (Make attempt to move gradually).
1. Contemplate to visualize, by eye of wisdom, on the arising, here and then there, of _catusamuṭṭhānika rûpa-kāya_ = changeing of *rûpa dhamma*s one new place after another because of the power of _vāyo dhamma_ making up these _rûpa kalāpa_. (These are phenomena of *appadhādna rûpa*s being carried away from one place to another.)

When one can cūncentrate and analyze bū _ñāña_ contemplate as follows. ūūū

1. _Padhāna rûpa_ = concentrated _rûpa_, and _appadhāna_ = non-concentrated _rûpa_ in combination and concentrate as **_Rûpa dhamma_, _R_**_ûpa dhamma_.
1. _Citta_ and _cetasika_ combined as one, and coūcentrated as \*N**āma dhamma, Nāma dhamma\***. ūūūū

N.B. When walking up and down concentrating on _rûpa_-_nāma_, go slowly. If it is your first time, walk on the walk-way you are used to it. In culturing _samādhi_, at the start of the walk-way in standing position, concentrate on _samuṭṭhānika_-*rûpa dhamma*s, closed your eyes. This as well as applies while walking and standing. When your have gradually succeeded in this exercise, you can open your eyes slightly while meditating. Your mind set on going, the _manodvārika jhāna_ may be _kusala_ or *akusala jhāna*s for you. But at the moment of your concentration on the _rûpa_-_nāma_, they could only be _kusala jhāna vīthi_ because of _rûpa-nāma pariccheda_ _ñāña_ (analytical knowledge of _rûpa_ and _nāma_).

Mediation can also be made by way of fivepfold _khanddhā_, of 12 modes of _āyatana_ and of 18 *dhātu*s. ūūūū

Among these _manodvārika javana vīthi, javana_ (object of concentration) may, or may not, be the _tadārammana_. But note that _viññatta_-_rûpa_ cannot arise in the _tadārammana_. Only when _karma rûpa_-_nāma_ is taken as the object and only when _ārammana_ is _vibhûtā_- _rammana_, can _viññatta_-_rûpa_ arise in the _tadārammana_.

In so doing too, the folūowing fourūshould be peūformed time and again.

1. Concentrate on thū _rûpa_ and _rūpa_ only (_rûpa_-_pariggaha_).
1. Concentrate ūn _nāma_ and *nāmaū only (*nāma-pariggaha\*).
1. Concentrate on _rûpa_-_nāma_ (_rûpa-nāma-pariggaha_).
1. Analyzing _rûpa_ and _nāma_ (_rûpa-nāma-vavutthāna_).

**_Yathā yathā vā panassa kayo paṇihito hoti, kathā kathā nam pajānāti_** ū

This instructiūn from the Buddha has been explained in two different ways. In the first method the *citta-rûpa kalāpa*s, in which is included _iriyapaṭha viññatta_, concentrated as state of going – standing – sitting – lying down of the four bodily parts =

the *cittaja-rûpa dhamma*s, kept as primary, are to be concentrated as _appadhānū_. ūūū

In the second method it is instructed that of ūhe *catusamuṭṭhānika rûpa-kāya dhamma*s, which are _appadhāna_, are cultured as _padhāna_, then _cittaja-rûpa-kāya_, which are included in the *iriyapaṭha viññatta-rûpa*s* = all *rûpa dhamma\*s are taken as

_appadhāna_. (This has been explained in section on _Rûpa Kammaṭṭhāna_).ū

With reference ūo this instruction a mediator should contemplate on an _rûpa_-_nāma_ only in such a way thatūeach bodily parts merūed together. See the following.
ūū

1. _Cittaja_-_rûpa_, comprised of _iriyapaṭha viññatta_, are kept as the padhāna, and the _catusamuṭṭhānika rûpa-kāya_ = all the *rûpa dhamma*s, as the _appadhāna_.
2. All the *samuṭṭhānikū rûpa-kāya dhamma*s, existing a phenomena being carried away, are again taken as _padhāna_ (exerted), and taking _cittaja_-*rûpa*s, made up of _iriyapaṭha viññatta_, as _apdhāna_, and are concentrated in this way.
3. Afterwards, contiūue meditating on _manodvārika javana vīthi citta_-*cetasika nāma dhamma*s, which are exerted by the mind, and that for going, standing, sitting and lying down.
4. Then cultivate on _rûpa_-_nāma_ as a follow-up.
5. Concentrate on _rūpa_-_nāma_ analytically. ū

These are *cittaja-rûpa*s made of *iriyapaṭha viññatta rûpa*ū, existing as phenomena of being carried away. ū

It is important that concentration on the solid masses of _rûpa_ are broken down by _ñāṇa_ to paramatta pieces (which only be realized by the _ñāṇa_). It must be noted that only when the _ghana_ (solid mass) of _rûpa_ and _nāma_ have been broken down can _anatta_

(non-self) be visualized by eye of wisdom. ū

1. The state of going is clearly realized (practice to realize).
1. The state of standing is clearly realized (practice to realize).
1. The state of sitting is clearly realized (practice to realize).
1. The state of lying down is clearly realized (practice to realize).

In the four situations of contemplation in the first section of the _iriyāpatha_, _addhāna- iriyāpatha =_ long-life bodily parts have been referred to in the Buddha’s

expatiation.

The Lord has instructed that the exercise on going forward, backward, looking straight ahead or looking sideways, flexing or relaxing is to be made by virtue of _sampa- jañña ñāṇa_. In this case, the Lord has referred to mediocre-life bodily parts.

Again, the _sampajañña ñāṇa_ has been indicated in the states of _gate_ (going), _thite_ (standing), _nisanne_ (sitting), _sutte_ (asleep), _jāgarite_ (waking). In these five situations, the Buddha has referred to the small *iriyāpatha*s such as _khuddaka_ (little one) and _cuṇṇika_ (smallest one) of the surrounding = employs a knowledge

that realizes the various directions of the surrounding (_Ma.-_ _ṭha.-_ 1:273)

_ABHIKKANTE - PAṭIKKANTE_ GOING FORWARD – GOING BACKWARD

Going forward is ūabhikkante* and backward *paṭikkante* forward*.\*

_Tadubhayampi catûsu iriyāpathesu labbhati_ (_Abhi_.- _ṭha.-_ 2: 331 – 332; M. _ṭha.-_ 1:258).

The four situations of _iriyāpatha_ can also be acquired in both goūng forward or backward.
ū

1. In the state of going, a person is directing his body forward (= all the *rûpa dhamma*s) are said to be going forward, and one whose body is directed backward going backward.
1. In the state of going too, a person who is leaning his body (= all the *rûpa dham-ma*s) forward while standing, without any steps made yet, is said to to be going forward; when his body is leaning backward, he is going backward.
1. In sitting (no standing nor going forward) also, a person is said to going forward (_abhikkamati_) while sitting (facing towards the front parts of the body), as he is loking straight ahead. The state of going toward the hinder parts of the body is sadi to be going backward. It is the same in lying down, i.e. going forward or backward while lying down ((_Abhi_.- _ṭha.-_ 2: 331 – 332; M. _ṭha.-_ 1:258).

**_SAMPAJāNAKāRI HOTI_**

By virtue of knowledge that understands the the surrounding, one makes movements forward and backward. in other words, a person used to employ a knowledge that realizes different directions of surroundings = employs a knowledge that could

understand the various directions of the surrounding.

Indeed, a meditating ascetic makes going forward or backward by virtue of _sampajañña_ _ñāṇa_. There is nothing that not associated with the _sampajañña_ _ñāṇa_. The _sampajañña_ _ñāṇa_ is always associated with _sati_ (consciusness). The broad explanation of _sampajañña_ _ñāṇa_, therefore, by _niddesa_ Pāli is

_Sato_ _sampajañno abhikkamati, sato sampajañno paṭikkamati_

Being mindful and endowed with _sampajañña ñāṇa_, he proceeds forward, and backward in a similar way.

In this way, the Lord has included mindfulness too in His instruction. An ascetic going foward or backward makes it done with consciousness (mindfulness) = never with a wavering mind nor without the all-understanding _sampajañña ñāṇa_. In fact, being mindful and endowed with the _sampajañña ñāṇa_ which realizes various situations, movement forward or backward is made correspondingly

(_Abhi.- ṭha._-2: 332; _Ma._- _ṭha._-1: 258).

_Sabbesu abhikkamadīsu catubbiham sampajaññam otāreti_ (_Abhi.- ṭha._-2: 332).

In the performaces such as going forward etc., the four situations of _sampajañña_ are effected (_Abhi.- ṭha._-2: 332).

The question here is “What is that kind of knowledge that understands, and understands clearly, by _sampajaña-kārī_, various situation in the surrounding*”*? The answer is as given below.

THE FOUR-FOLD *SAMPAJAÑÑA*S

1. _Satthaka sampajañña_
1. _Sappāya sampajañña_
1. _Gocara sampajañña_
1. _Asammoha sampajañña_

\1. _Satthaka sampajañña_

Among these four, a consciousness arises to go forward, but you would not go

along with it. You ask your-self if there could be or could not be of any advantage going there. Concentration, by analysis through _ñāṇa_, on the advantage or disadvantage of going is called **_Satthaka sampajañña_** (_Abhi.- ṭha._-1: 285).

**WHAT BENEFICIAL _DHAMMA_ IS**

_Tattha ca atthoti cetiyadassana-bodhidassana-samghassadassana-asubhadassanā- divasena dhammato vuṭṭi_ (_Abhi.- ṭha._-2: 332; _Ma.- ṭha._- 1: 258).

In the above statement, the advantage refers to paying homage to a _cetiya_, to bo tree, to a _sanghā_, to a _sanghāthera_, to the great teachers, and seeing an _asubha_ etc. By the power of these, development of _dhamma_ is attained = development of _kusala_ _dhamma_. (If going forward or backward results in development of _kusala dhamma_, then

it is an advantage from point of view of _satthaka_-_sampajañña_.).

HOW THE BENEFIT CAN BE ACQUIRED

If one could pay homage to a cetiya, or a bo tree, there arises _Buddhārammana_-_pīti_ (mental feeling of loy with the Buddha as object of meditation) together with _mahā_-_kusala mandodvārika vīthi_ mental processes. If the characters of these are taken on the nature of ūū

_khaya-vaya_ (ūepletion-destruction) are taken as object of concentration on their three general characters, one can attain _Arahatta-phala_. If the homage is paid to *sanghāthera*s (= great teachers), and _vipassanā_ exercise made following their teaching, one can acquire _Arahatta- phala_. Concentrating on the _asubha_ (the dead body = loathsomeness), and attaining the first _jhāna_ on this dead body, then the _khaya-vaya_ nature of that _jhāna_ are contemplated on the the three general characters, one can also attain the _Arahatta-phala_. Therefore, paying homage to _cetiya_, to the bo tree, to _sanghā_, to _sanghā thera_, seeing the dead body etc., should be taken to have the benefit. (This benefit can be enjoyed by those who have acquired _nāma- rûpa-pariccheda-ñāṇa_ the successful concentration on ultimate reality of the _rûpa-nāma_, the _paccaya-pariggaha-ñāṇa_ the successful contemplation on the nature of the _paṭiccasamuppāda_ = causal relationship at past, future and present periods, and have acquired _viapssanā_-_ñāṇa_ to the attainment of _bhañga_- _ñāṇa_, the ability to concentrate on the causal relation-

ship of the _rûpa-nāma_ = the *sañkāra dhamma*s, to their three genral characters).

To those who believe in _keci_, the material wealth _āmisa_ also is a benefit, _sīla, samādhi, paññā_, the three-fold noble moralities dependent upon the four kinds of materials, the _ariaya magga_, one has the chance to practice insupport of the _sāsanā_ called _magga- brahmacariya_ which are _sāsana brahmā_-_cariya_ (_Abhi_- _ṭha_.-2: 332;Ma.- _ṭha_.-1:258).

_SAPPāSAMPAZAÑÑA_

In going along with the intention of paying homage to the _cetiya_ etc., discrimation of whether it is suitable or not is made by _ñāṇa_, and only that which is suitable is

followed. This is the **_sappāya-sampajañña_**.

It is indeed beneficial to pay homage to the _cetiaya_. If, however, celebration of a festival on a large scale for the purpose has been made, then people from far and near would have gathered there. People, men and wemen would be clad in the best clothes they could afford and be going round and round. If a meditator encounters _iṭṭhārammana_ then an attachment and _lobha_ to it could have arisen in him. If an _aniṭṭhārammana_ is encountered, then _pagṭigha phenomenon of_ gross mind would arise in him. Moha phenomena would arise depending on these *kāmaguṇa*s, because of unwise attention (men handsome or not, wemen beautiful or ugly etc.) due to lack of penetrative attention

of the right object of concentration. Pushing through the crowd contact with wemen would result in commiting _kāyasamgassa_ (violation through body contact). Accidents with elephants or a vehicle could have resulted in life-threatening injuries. Encounter with various *visabhāga-ārammana*s (objects of extraordinary nature) has cause unhappiness in the _sāsanā_, will to leave a monk’s life to become a layman, which are not condusive to success in cultivating _sīla, samādhi_ and _paññā_, which are the practice of _brahmacariya_. If such these are the results, then the place of _cetiya_, where festivals are being held, is an _asappaya_ (place not suitable as yet to go). The above mentioned dangers do not occurred, then it is _sappāya_ (a place suitable to go). The same principles

apply to the case of paying homage to the bo tree (_Abhi_- _ṭha_.-2: 332-333).

Paying homage to the _sanghā_ also is beneficial. But a big crowd listening to the sermon, given by the *sanghā*s, throughout the whole night is an _asappāya_, as in the above case. If such a place is not a danger to the well being of man and to noble practice _brahmacariya_, then the it is a suitable place to go. This is also true of paying homage to *mathera*s surrounded by crowd of believers (_Abhi_- _ṭha_.-2: 332-333; _Ma_.- _ṭha_.-1:258-9). ū

Concentrating on the _asubha_ also of benefit. To make it explicit, a story runs like this. A young Arahant, accompanied by a novice, went around to find a material to make a toothbrush. As they went along, the young novice continued the expedition from the roadside and came across an _asubha_ (dead human body). Taking it as an object, the novice attempted to attain the first _asubha jhāna_ then and there. After acquiring it, he exercise _vipassanā_ on the three genral characters of the *sañkhāra dhamma*s. Then he succeeded in attaining _anāgāmi-magga-phala_ by series of _magga_ and _phala_. But he did not stopthere, but continued exercising on the causal relationhip of _rûpa_-_nāma_, the object of meditation for _vipassanā_- _ñāṇa_, to attain the higher _magga-ñāṇa_ referred to as the

_arahatta-magga_.

When the _arahant_ has lost sight of the novice he called out as “_sāmaṇe_, _sāmaṇe_.” [From the day of his entering a novice’s life reciting the words of the arahants has become the first words ever produced. Not following the aranhant’s words has becomem his second language. The novice always speaks the first words, but never the second. Therefore, this is a _sāmaṇe_ (the novice) who never speaks two different languages (_Ma_.-

_ṭī_.- 1: 335).]\*

Then the pondered. “Since the day of becoming a novice, I have never ever spoken two different languages with the arahants. I would acquire the noble dhammas the higher _maggañāṇa_ and _phala_-_ñāṇa_. After having such a thought, the novice answered the arahant’s call, “yes sir, what is it?” “Come along” was the arahant’s single call. The _sāmaṇe_ came along and said “Sir, go along this way first, then at the place

where I have been standing and look and see towards the east.”

The young _arahant_ duely acted as the _sāmaṇe_ has indicated, and succeeded in attaining _anāgāmi-magga- ñāṇa_ and _phala_-_ñāṇa_.

In this way, the dead body has appeared for the benefit of two individual worldlings. Benefit it may provide, the female dead body would be an _asappaya_ for a male meditator and the male dead body for a female meditator. The male dead body is _sappāya_ for a male and meditator, and the feamale dead body for a female meditator.

This could lead one to the attainment of _asubha-jhāna_. The ability to discrimate, by analytical _ñāṇa_, as to whether a factor is _sappāya_ or _asappāya_ and only the one that is _sappāya_ is referred to as **_sappāya-sampajañña_** (_Abhi_- _ṭha_.-2: 332-333; _Ma_.- _ṭha_.-1:258-9).

[In _samatha_ having a male _asubha_ as the object of concentration for a male meditator is _sabhāga_ (of usual nature). So is it for female. In _samatha_ effort is made of intensive concentration commonly on the dead body to attain _jhāna_. The contemplation is made until _jhāna_ attained. If _visabhāga_ (unusal) object has been concentrated upon intensively, _paṭibhānimitta_ will be acquired, which in turn form an object for arising of _pīti_ and _sukha_ associated with _samādhi_. Then the already-attained _samādhi_ will deteriorate, and would be unable to progressed towards higher _jhāna-samādhi_. That is why it usual to concentrate on common dead body in _samatha_. In _vipassanā_ exercise, however, concentration upon the dead body of _Sīrimā_ by *arahant*s of both sexes, male and female laities has been mentioned in old scriptures, Vijaya-Suttana etc.. the concentration can be made on both _sabhāga- visabhāga_ factors. It will be clearly

describedin section on Vipassanā).

**_GOCARA-SAMPAJAÑÑA_**

The meditating _arahant_, who has succeeded in culturing _sātthaka-sampajaññā_ and _sappāya-sampajañña_, by analytical cultured via analytical knowledge, has learned _gocara_ (= _kammaṭṭhāna ārammana_), one which he likes most from among the 38 modes of _samatha_ _kammaṭṭhāna_. He exercise on it to the attainment of _uggaha nimitta_ (an image recognized by mind), and concentrating on it during alms-colleting round (= going around alms-collection with that _kammaṭṭhāna_ taken to heart. This concentration is

called **_gocarasampajañña_** (Abhi.- _ṭha_.-2: 333; _Ma_.- _ṭha_.-1: 259).

[N.B. With reference to these explanations, it must be noted that the *gocara-sampajañña* is concerned with *samatha* exercise only. The *samatha* *kammaṭṭhāna* is of (38) kinds, where *ākāsa-kasiṇa* is explained in *ākāsānañcāyatana jhāna*, *āloka-kasiṇa* in *odāta-kasiṇa* and included in it. Although *gocara-sampajañña* is orientated towards the *samatha* *kammaṭṭhāna*, if the meditator himself has succeeded in *vipassanā* exercise surpassing the *samatha*, then he can meditate by both ways. This is explained so because it will be seen that *gocara-sampajañña* is associated with the *samatha*, whereas *asammoha-sampajañña* with the *vipassanā*. One should have wrong belief that *vipassanā* exercise should not be made while going alms-collection round and it way back.]

**THE FOUR KINDS OF _VUTTA_**

THE FOUR KINDS OF CONDUCT

In this *sāsanā*ū the following _catukka_ (a set of four) should be understood for the clarity of _gocara-sampajañña_.
ū

1. Some *bhikkhû*s go along with _kammaṭṭhāna_, exerting effort to exercise on it during alms-collection rounds, but not on the way back.
1. Some *bhikkhū*s go along with _kammaṭṭhāna_, exerting effort to exercise on it on the way back, but not during alms-collection rounds.
1. Some do not either way.
1. Some *bhikkhû*s go along with _kammaṭṭhāna_, exerting effort to exercise on it both during alms-collection rounds, and on the way back.
1. **One who goes along with _kūmmaṭṭhāna_, exerting effort to exercise** **on it** **during alms-collection rounds, but not on the way back.**

Among the four kinds of *bhikkhû*s, one practices the whole day while walking and sitting so as to be relieved of *nīvarana dhamma*s (hinderances) to *kusala dhamma*s (= distancing himself from the *nīvarana dhamma*s by acquiring one of *samādhi*s, referred to as _upācāra-samādhi_ and _appanā-samādhi_). The practice was made during the fisrt part of the night to get the mind cleansed of _nīvaraṇa_ factors. At midnight he went to sleep, and at dawn the arahant whiled away the time _samattha_ is taken the to the heart by walking and sitting exercises. In the early morning he carried out the duty of _cetiyasañ_-_gaṇa vutta_ at the _cetiya_, _bodiyañgaṇa vutta_ at the bo tree and water to it, filled water in pots the water for drinking, then practiced _ācariya-vutta_ due to the teachers and\*

 _uppajjhūra-vutta_ due to the _uppajjhāra_ teachers. All of these duties are referred to as _khandhaka-vutta._ ū

The _bhikkhû_ then washed his face, paid short and long visits, cleaned himself and entered the the monastry and made mental culture cross-legged two or three times, by which he warmed himself up. After the mental exercise and when time is up to go for alms- collection rounds, he got up still exercising the _kammaṭṭhāna_ (= taking _kammaṭṭhāna_ to heart) picked up alms-bowl and the robe and left the monastry. Still taking _kammaṭṭhāna_ to heart (not forgetting his usual _parihāriya kammaṭṭhāna_), the _bhikkhû_ went to the _cetiya_. If his _parihāriya kammaṭṭhāna_ happened to be _buddhā-nussati kammaṭṭhāna_,ūhe would enter the compound of the _cetiya_ still concentrating on the _buddhā-nussati kammaṭṭhāna_. If his

exercise happened to one other than _buddhā-nussati kammaṭṭhāna_, such as _ānāpāna_ (mindfulness of in- and out-breath), then he should leave it at the start of the passage way to the _cetiya_ compound, make effort to acaquire _Buddhārammana_-_pīti_ having the _Buddha-guṇa_ as the object of concentration. After attaining this state, turn three round on your right around the _cetiya_ and pay homage to it at four corners, if the _cetiya_ is a large one. If the _cetiya_ is a small one, turn three rounds and pay homage to it at eight corners. After completing paying homage to the _cetiya_, the _bhikkhû_ came to the ground around the bo tree and pay homage to it respectfully, as if he were right infront of the Buddha.

[N.B. The _cetiya_ and the bo tree were those located on the way of alms-collection

round, not ūhe ones at the monastic dwelling.] ū

The _bhikkhû_ then came out of the monastry back and at the entrance he picked the his usual practice of _pārihāriya_ _kammaṭṭhāna_, took to the heart, wrapped around his robe and entered the village for the purpose of alms collection. When the *dāyaka*s and *dāyika*s saw the arahant coming, they welcome him saying “our _bhikkhû_ has come” and took the alms-bowl from him. They would made him rest in the village house or at home and offered porridge. The *dāyaka*s and *dāyika*s washed his legs, massaged and apply

massaging oil. Sitting at a proper place infront of the rahant, they would respectfully discussed various problems of their daily life, while waiting the food to get cooked. They would listen to his preaching. If the *dāyaka*s and *dāyika*s did not request for preaching, _aṭṭhakathā_ teachers has indicated that the sermon should be in their honor.

[*Janasañgahatta* – The *aṭṭhakathā* teachers have stated that the laiies should be honored with *dhamma-nuggaha* with “If I do not offer them a preaching, who will? ” in mind (*Ma*.- *ṭī.-* 1:356).]

_Dhammakathā hi kammaṭṭhāna-vinimuttā nāma natthi_ (_Abhi_. -_ṭha_.- 2:334; Ma.- _ṭha._ - 1: 260). ū

_Dhammakathā_ – Talks on (the Buddha’s) doctrine are always associated with _kammaṭṭhāna_. So, while having alms-food concentrate on your usual _kammaṭṭhāna_ (= taking to heart the _pārihāriya_ _kammaṭṭhāna_ you are used to practicing on). Preach _anumodanā dhamma_ (expression of appreciation) while having the usual _kammaṭṭhāna_ at heart. The _bhikkhû_, with the *dāyaka*s and *dāyika*s who followed him to see him off, came out of the village, and the followers were asked to leave him at the village exist. He

continued his journey ūlong the way back to the monastry. ū

When the young *bhikkhû*s and novices, who left the monastry earlier than the _bhikkhû_ for alms-collection, on the way back to the monastry, were having their meal

outside theūvillage. When they saw him coming, they welcome him. Help carry the alms- bowl and the robe. ūūūūū

The *bhikkhû*s of early times took care of their teachers, an act which has its roots in days of *buddha*s, referred to as the *poraṇaka bhikkhû*s, not for special favour. This action was taken irrespective whether or not familiar, but whoever it is they would take good care of him. The young *bhikkhû*s then asked the bhikkhû, who has just returned from the alsm collection rounds in the village, if those who were taking good care of him were his relatives. Then the _bhikkhû_ countered as to why they asked such a question. The young *bhikkhû*s replied “because we noted that they paid respect and took good care

of you.” ūūū

“My *bhikkû*s, it is hard to carry out such duties even to their mothers and fathers. They, however, perform these duties for us. Our alms-bowls and robes are theirs, because of their assistance we do not have to face danger nor starvation in time of famine. We owed them a gratitude and there are none comparable to them.” In this way, the *bhikkhû*s have replied in praise of the *dāyaka*s and *dāyika*s, and entered the monastry without exercising while chatting among themselves. This kind of _bhikkhû_ shouldbe referred to as “ **practicing _kammaṭṭhāna_ on the trip to alms-collection round, but not on the return trip from the village to the monastry**. (_Abhi_.- _ṭha_. 2:

333 – 335; _Ma.- ṭha_.-1: 259 – 261).

2. **One who doesūnot practice** **_kammaṭṭhāna_ on the trip for alms-collection but does on the return trip** ū

A certain _bhikkhû_ got up early in the morning and carried out duties due to him as mentioned above. While doing so, he felt so hungry that he started sweating heavily. The empty stomach was so troublesome that he had to forfeit _kammaṭṭhāna_. The bhikkhû

then picked up his alms-bowl and robe quickly, came out of the monastic dwelling and pay homage to the _cetiya_. He procceded to the village early, got a bowl of yāgu (gruel) and drank it at the public rest place. A two- or three-mouthful of gruel helped hin get relief from hunger, and felt the whole body cooled down. Then with his mind set on the _kammaṭṭhāna_ = _kammaṭṭhāna_ taking to the heart, continued having gruel. Later, he washed his bowl, mouth and face, exercise on _kammaṭṭhāna_ before alms-collection round and eating time. At the time of having the morning meal the _kammaṭṭhāna_ is taken to the heart. From the time of alms- collection and of alms-food the _kammaṭṭhāna_ has been exercised repetitively, continuing it to his way back. Such a monk is referred to as “one who does not exercise _kammaṭṭhāna_ on alsm-collection round, but does so on his way

back fro the village to the monastic dwelling.” (_Abhi_-_ṭha.-_ 2: 333; _Ma_.- _ṭha.-_ 1: 261).\*\*

**_GAṇANAPATHAM ūĪTI VATTA_** ū

_Edisā ca bhikkhû yāgum pivitvā vipassanūm ārabhitvā Buddha-sāsane ahārattam pattā nāma gaṇanapattam vītivatta_. _Sīhaļadipeyyeva tesu tesu gāmesu **āsanasālāya**_\*\* _na tam_ _āsanam atthi, yattha yāgum vivitvā arahattam pattā bhikkhû natthīūi_ (_Abhi_.- _ṭha_. 2: 335; _Ma.- ṭha_.-1: 259 – 261).

After having the gruel, the *bhikkhû*s continued mental exercising and attained _arahatta-phala_. Such successful individuals are innumerable in the Buddha _sāsanā_. In Sri Lanka, for example, there is no place without the *bhikkhû*s who had acquired _arahatta-phala_ after continued meditation of _kammaṭṭhāna_ right after _yāgu_ meal in the\*

morning (_Abhi_.- _ṭha_. 2: 335; _Ma.- ṭha_.-1: 259 – 261).

3. **One who doesūnot practice _kammaṭṭhāna_ on the way to and back from the alms-collection rounds** ūūūū

A certaūn _bhikkhû_ leads a life in the Buddha _sāsanā_ without _kammaṭṭhāna_ practice but not taking it seriously. A _bhikkhû_ is bound by two compulsory duities: _gantha dûra_ – teaching and learning the Buddha’s doctrine, and _vipassanā dûra_ – to exercise _vipassanā_ meditation. The _bhikkhû_ neglected these two duties, nor did he fulfill that _vatta_ a

_bhikkhû_ is bound to perform.

1. Craving for the living and non-living meaterials = still lingered on to _raga_.
1. Attachment to his own material body = still lingered on to _rāga_.
1. _Bahidda_ = still lingered on to external material factors.
1. Try to enjoy comfort in dosing, sleeping on the back and sides after having a full meal.
1. Practice _sāsanahma-cariya_ with an intenstion of attaining of celestial realm of no

 particular plane.

These are the five modes of obstacle to the _citta_ (ūind). ūūū

With his mind wrapped in these obstacles, the _bhikkhû_ remained in the _sāsanā_. He entered the village, having no perception in mind that “There is such a thing as _kammaṭṭhāna_,” for alms- collection. In the village he would mingle with villagers, an unbecoming _bhikkhû_’s life, chatting while going along with the villagers. Then he would come to a public rest place and had his meal without _kammaṭṭhāna_ exercise, and with nothing in mind the bhikkhû left the village. Such a bhikkhû should be designated as

“one who does not carry with hin the _kammaṭṭhāna_ when going around for alms-collection nor on his return to the monastic premises (_Abhi_.- _ṭha_. 2: 335; _Ma.- ṭha_.-1: 259 – 261).

4. **One who meditate both to and from the village for alms-collection**

**round (_Gatapaccāūgatikavatta_)** ū

A certain _bhikkhû_ “cultivates _kammaṭṭūāna_ on the way to the village for alms- collection rounds, and on the way back from the village to the monastic dwelling.” Now, recognize such a _bhikkhû_ as **_gatapaccā-gatikavatta_.**

A man enters the _sāsanā_ realm as a _bhikkhû_ with the intention of attaining _magga_, _phala_ and _nibbāna_. Then they gather in groups of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 100 and agreed among themselves to share a monastic dwelling.

“_Ãvuso tumhe na iṇaṭṭhā na bhyaṭṭā_, _na_ _ājīvikāpakatā pabbajitā_, _dukkhā muccitukāmā panettha pabbajitā_. _Tasmā gamane uppannakilesam gamaneyyeva nigganhatha_. _ṭhāne_, _nisajjāya_, _sayane uppannakilesam sayaneyyeva nigganhatha_.”

“My Lords ---- You have entered the monkhood not because of debts you owed to others, nor have you run away from the ruler’s punishment. You have entered the realm of _sāsanā_ not because it is difficult to make ends meet as a laity. In fact, it is with the intention of being delivered from the suffering of the sansāric circus that you have adopted a life in the Buddha’s Order. Therefore, get yourself relieved of _kilesā_

(defilement) that would arise at the moments of walking, standing, sitting and sleeping.

Making promises among themselves to get rid of _kilesa_ whenever it arises, they reside in the same dwelling.

Aftr such undertaking, they went out for alms-collection. On the way they came across large stones at every half _usabha_, one _usabha_ (a measure of distance), half _gāvuta_, one _gāvuta_ (a measure of distance also). They continued their journey while concentrating on the perception of the features of the stones. (That is to say to mark a

stone from spot of which the meditation is ūtarted on the way to and from the village). ūūū

If the _kilesā_ arises in a certain _bhikkhû_ at a certain moment, it is got rid of then and there. [Picking up the routine mental exercise surrounded by the five great powers of _saddā_), _viriya_, _sati_, _samādhi_ and _paññā_ the _kilesā_ is extinguished). If he failed in doing so, he would sopt and stand still, and the pne behind would also stop. (It is because one _bhikkhû_ understands the other, it would not have occurred in his mind as “What’s wrong with this one? He stopped while he should be continuing to the destination.” This understanding among the *bhikkhû*s is quite helpful in curbing the _kilesā_, an act quite respectable on the part of every _bhikkhû_. Understanding among the meditators is of great

help in culūivating, and is a kind of _paṭipatti_ (conduct). Now continue.] ū

The _bhikkhû_, in whom _kilesā_ is arising, thought to himself, “Well, the one behind kows what’s happening to you. This _vitakka_ in your _santāna_ is consistent with your way of life.” In this way, the _bhikkhû_ came to himself, and picked up the routine _vipassanā_

exercise step by step and attained _ariya_ plane. ū

If the _kilesā_ couldnot be curtailed by standing still, the bhikkhû would sit down, and the one behind followed suit. Then, while sitting he would make every effort to curb ū

the _kilesā_, by taking the previous exercise to the heart. [The understanding that if kilesāhad been arising and toturing him, he and the one behind, would be late for alms-collection, and would have to forego the meal of the day. Such ū consideration for his colleague creates a _yonisomanisikāra_ (right intention). Because of this, the _bhikkhû_

exercised on the mental training (*Ma.- ṭī.-*1: 356). Though _ariya_ plane could not be attained, the _kilesā_ could be eliminated for a considerable time by power of _jhāna_-_samādhi_ in the form of _vikkhambhana-pahāna_, and the _bhikkhû_ started moving for the purpose of alms collecting with his own _kammaṭṭhāna_ taken to the heart. He would not shake his legs without mind associated with _kammaṭṭhāna_ (= never losing the object of the exercise). If he did, however, he would return to previous place with the mind not associated with _kammaṭṭhāna_. Then he started again with the mind associated with _kammaṭṭhāna_. Remember the great Mahāphussadeva Mathera (_Abhi.- ṭha._-2: 335 – 336; _Ma_.- _ṭha._-1: 262).

**The Noble Mahāphussadeva Mathera**

The Noble Mahāphussadeva Mathera has been fulfilling the _gata-paccāgatavatta_ (= _gatapaccā-gatikavatta_) for the whole of the 19 years. The people, those ploughing their fields, those transplanting the rice plants, and those who are thrashing the paddy along the way to alms-collection rounds, noted the Mathera going to and fro. The remark among themselves was that “Has the Mathera lost his way, or has he forgotten something at his dwelling.” The Mathera, however, condoned their remarks, and practice hardly on the mind associated with _kammaṭṭhāna_. In this way in twenty years’ time, he attained the Arahatta-Phala.

On the day of the attainment of Arahatta-Phala, a _yukkha-devatā_ (tree spirit) appeared standing at the start of the walk-way and offering light by burning his finger tips. To pay homage to the Mathera, approached the four kings celestial beings of

_Catumahārāja_, Sovereigh of heaven, and the King Sahampati-Brahmā.

After seeing the light from burning fingers and from the devās, the Vanavāsī Mahātissa Mathera asked the Noble Mahāphussadeva Mathera as follows.

Last night I saw light around you. Where are they from? “Well, light can come from an oil lamp or from a ruby,” was the answer to avoid from telling him was really

has happened that night.

Then Vanavāsī Mahātissa Mathera said, “You are secretive, aren’t you?” “Yes” was the answer to it (_Abhi.- ṭha._-2: 336; _Ma_.- _ṭha._-1: 262 - 263).

**N.B.** The Noble Mahāphussadeva Mathera would not care whatever others say about him, but concentrate on his _kammaṭṭhāna_ uninterrupted. This is one of the priceless old methods that one should follow. Ignorant sentient beings have the habit of making frivolous talks. If attention has been given to such talks, you will be wasting your previous time, and deteriorate the practice of _kammaṭṭhāna_. If you could concentrate, take your _kammaṭṭhāna_ on to the heart, and lead your life with citta associated with _kammaṭṭhāna_, you would succeed as the Noble Mahāphussadeva Mathera one day.

**The Noble _Mahānāgama Mathera_** ū

The great Mahānāga Mathera, residing at _Kāļavulli mandāna_ (= black vine _mandāna_) fulfilled the _gatapaccagatavatta_, first he decided to practiced _dukkha-cariya_, which the Buddha spent 6 years = **_Mahāpādha_** method, for 7 years as _paṭi_-_patti-pûja_ (devotional attention). During these 7 years, standing, walking up and down (= taking the _kammaṭṭhāna_ to the heart while walking up and down and standing). These were carried out with self- determination. (the Mathera never changed his body to sitting or sleeping positions, except when having alms meal and when paying long and short visits. When the seven years of resolution has completed, the Mathera again practiced in conti-

nuation the _gatapaccagatavatta_ for 16 years and acquired the Arahatta-Phala.

The great Mathera strode for walking with his mind associated with the _kam- maṭṭhāna_, and lifted the legs in the same way. If he ever did so without _kammaṭṭhāna_- associated mind (= moving his legs while his mind has lost the _kammaṭṭhāna_), he would turn back to where he had started, and proceeded with _kammaṭṭhāna_–associated mind. (_kammaṭṭhāna_ here means the routine one).

In this way the Mathera continued going and arrived near a village. There, he chose such a place that no one could recognize him, stood still, wrapped around his robe and washed the alms-bowl with water carried in a container in his arm. The Mathera then had a gulp of water and kept in the mouth without swallowing. This is done with the intention that “if people come and offer alm-food or pay homage to me, I would have blessed them with a wish – _Dīghāyukā hotha_ = may you live long – and I would lose my

concentration.” ū

If any one asked “my Lord what is today,” or the number of *bhikkhû*s at the monastry or a certain problem is put to him, the the Mathera would swallow the water and gave the answer. If none is encountered on the way, then he would spit out the water on his way back at the gate of the village and proceed to the monastic dwelling (_Abhi.-_

_ṭha._-2: 336; _Ma_.- _ṭha._-1: 262 - 263).

**An Invaluable Instruction**

Even if he blessed the laity for a longer life, the great Mahānāga Mathera would have lost his concentration. That is the reason he had a mouthful of water, for the great Mathera could not afford his concentration dispersing from him. One must be careful not to lose concentration, by chatting, if one intended to attain _nibbāna_. Too much chatting is not associated with the noble _sikkhā_ (training) = _sīla, samādhi, paññā_. In fact, chatting is one of the root causes of losing one’s concentration. Therefore, this is an

invaluable instruūtion for you intent on contemplating.

The Fifty *Bhikkhû*s Keep Lent at a Monastry on the Bankūof _Kalamba_ River

In the monastry on the bank of Kalamba, 50 *bhikkhû*s spent four months of lent having an agreement among themselves not chat with each other until the Arahatta-phala is attined. They entered the village with mouthful of water. If any body enquire day of the week etc., they would clear water from the mouth to answer the query. [The chatting is not entirely stopped, but answered the enquiry that should answered, unlike a dumb

object, because the Buddha did not like the habit a dumb-like behavior.] ūūū

The villagers, looking at the wet earth, because of removing water in the mouth, noted one or two *bhikkhû*s have returned from the village. It also occurred in their minds what has happened to their *bhikkhû*s. If they do not talk to us, would they do the same among themselves? If they did not chat among themselves, then there might a certain disagreement among the *bhikkhû*s. “Come along, we would go to them and ask them to

foreget any disagreement and to tolerate any misunderstanding. ūūū

With a genral concensus, the villagers went up to the mūnastry. When they get there, they found the all the *bhikkhû*s, except two who were together and taking bath at a place. Then villager, with presence of mind, told the others that “My friends, this does not look like a place where the *bhikkhû*s have had disagreement among themselves. Look, the compounds of cetiya and bo tree have been swept clean, the sweeper after use has been well placed. The water pots have been filled and placed properly.” Then the villagers turned back and headed toward their village. The *bhikkhû*s spent three months of lent, attained _Arahatta-phala_, and perform _visuddhipavāraṇa_ on the full moon _mahāpavāraṇa_ day. [Ceremony of the

invitation of criticism among the _kilesā_-free *bhikkhû*s if each is seen or suspected any wrong doing is called _visuddhipavāraṇa_.

(_Abhi_.-_ṭha._-2: 337; _Ma_.- _ṭha._-1: 263). ūū

[N.B. The villagers understand the rule of practice, and so return without making any enquiry of the *bhikkhû*s’ behavior. Even now, the *dāyakā*s and *dāyikā*s should refrain from talking too long with the *bhikkhû*s who are exercising on _samatha_ and

_vipassanā_.]

**Rules and Regulations that Should be Followed** ūū

Like the Mahānāga Mathera at Kāļavunlika and the 50 *bhikkhû*s that observed three months of spent at a monastry on the bank of Kalamba River, the bhikkhû proceeds to the village with the mind associated with _kammṭṭhāna_ (with mind having _kammṭṭhāna_ always taken to heart). (It specially refers to usual _kammaṭṭhāna_,

one exercise of the 40 kinds, such as _ānāpāna_ in- and out-breath). ūū

The village in which alms-collection round, with mouthful of water, is to be made is approached, and make a prior inspection of the road leading to it. This road should be free of drunkards, gamblers, wild elephants or horses. If the alms-collection round is made, the _bhikkhû_ should not walk briskly. _Paṇdapātika-dhutanga_ walking with a certain speed is undesirable. When walking on an uneven road, go in such a way as if the the surface is evenly smooth. The alms-collection is made at every house, those willing to and those unwilling to donate alms-food is noted, and waited for an appropriate duration time. When the collection has been completed, the _kammaṭṭhāna_ is taken to heart at a suitable place is selected in or outside the village or in the monastry where water etc., is available. Here _paṭikûla-saññā_ repulsiveness of food is perceived. After

such a perception, food should be looked upon as by virtue of the following examples.

1. Like _Akkhabbhañjana_, the greasing the hub of a wheel,
1. Like _Vaṇālepana_, medicine applied to a wound,
1. Like _puttamam_ person who eat his own son’s flesh to be able to overcome obstacles (_Sam_.-1: 233).

After such a consideration, perceived as

1. I am having this meal not for the purpose of playing around like village boys.
2. I am having this meal not for the purpose of gaining strength like a boxer or a wrestler.
3. I am having this meal not for the purpose of beautifying my self to sell by body in the palace atmosphere.
4. I am having this meal not for the purpose of making my self good looking like professional deancers.

As a matter of fact, the food is consumed:

1. For the maintenance of this body made of the four elements.
1. For the well-being and long life.
1. For the relief of suffering due to hunger.
1. For the attainment of the two modes of _Brahmacariya_ such as _Sāsana-Brahmacariya_

-   the three-fold _sikkhā_ of _sīla_-_samādhi_-_paññā_, and _Magga-Brahmacariya_ referred to as the Ariya-Magga (the Noble Path).

5. For relief of suffering of extreme hunger.
6. For hinderance of arising of new suffering of hunger.
7. For better feeling of the body as a whole after having food.
8. For a peaceful existence, but not the suffering due to _citta_ in searching, receving

and consuming, after having the food.

 The _ahāra_ is consumed, concentrating on its 8-fold _paccavekkhaṇa_ features.

After having the alms-food, and ther alms-bowl washed, a slight tiredness due fullness could arise, which could be relieved by lying donw on your left side (or whatever

body position is preferred).

*Kammaṭṭāna*ūexercise is taken to heart the whole morning by sitting or walking up and down as well as after lunch, before midnight and at dawn.

Such *bhikkhû*s, who are fulfilling the function of _gattapaccāgata-vutta_, are referred to as **those who exercise _Kammaṭṭāna_ both on the way to from the village for alms-collection round** (_Abhi_.- *ṭṭha.-*2: 337; _Ma_.- _ṭṭha_.- 1: 363-364).

One who fulfills the _paccagatavatta_ by exercising _Kammaṭṭāna_ on the way to from alms-collection round, and so complete with _upanissaya_ as to attain the _Arahatta_-

_phala_, then he can acquire the following.

1. He could attain the _Arahatta_-_Phala_ at the first part of his life, if not,
1. At the the _macchima_ (middle) part of his life, and if not,
1. Then at _pacchima_ (the last) part of his life.

 If the attainment of _Arahatta_-_Phala_ is still impossible at _pacchima_ existence,

4. It can be acquired at a time prior to near death moment. Supposed _Arahatta-Phala_ cannot be attained at a time prior to death.
5. It can be acquired as deity in the realm of celestial beings. Again, suppose the _Arahatta-Phala_ cannot be attained in this realm, and suppose also that one is endowed with powerful support as a cause = _upanissaya_ which is powerful enough to acquire _paccakkha_-_bodhiñāṇa_.
6. If one happens to acquire the life of sentient being at a time when the enlightened *Sammāsambuddhā*s have not arisen, then one can attain _paccekabodhi-ñāṇa._

If _paccekabodhi-ñāṇa_ cannot be attained, still endowed with _upanissaya-ñāṇa._ ū

7. Like Rev. Bāhiyadāruciriya Mathera, if existence of _Khippābhañña_ *Bhikkhû*s, possessing special knowledge that enables one to acquireArahatta-Magga and

 _Arahatta-Phala_ in no time in the presence of the enlightened ones _Sammāsam-_

*buddha*s. In addition, if he is endowed with _upanissaya_, then one can attain

8. Status of a recluse of great knowledge, like the Rev. Sāriputtarā Mathera, or
9. The status of an arahant of great power, like the Rev. Moggallāna Mathera, or
10. The status of an ascetic with the ability of _etadañga_ (pre-eminent in position) in practice of _dutañga_, like the Rev. Mahā-Kassapa Mathera, or
11. The status of a recluse being _etadañga_ in functioning of _dibba-cakkhu-abhiññāṇa_ (the Heavenly eye), like the Rev. Anuruddhā Mathera,or
12. The status of a recluse being _etadañga_ in the practice of _vinaya_, like the Rev. Upāli Mathera, or
13. The status of a recluse being _etadañga_ in performance of a Dhamma-kathika, like the Rev. Puṇṇa Mathera, the son of Mantāṇṇi the female byahmana, or
14. Can be an recluse being _etadañga_ like the Rev. Revata, the youngest borther of the Rev. Sāriputtarā, or
15. Can be an recluse being _etadañga_ in the possession of _bahusuta_ (having great knowledge) like the Rev. Ãnandā Mathera, or
16. Can be an recluse being _etadañga_ in wishing for _Sikkhākāma_ = the 3-fold noble morality like the Rev. Rāhulā Mathera, the son of the Buddha.

In this _catukka_ (tetrad), the recluse, practicing _kammaṭṭāna_ on the way to and from the alms collection rounds, has acquired the _gocara_-_sampajañña_ has attained it peak

in him.

Here – **_Abhikkante paṭikkante sampajānakārī hoti_** = going forward or backward is made with _sampajañña ñāṇa_ the knowledge of comprehension. In the section on the explanation of this Pāļi, the three mode of _sampajañña_ have been given as _sātthasampa_- _jañña_, _sappāya_-_sampajañña_ and _gocara-sampajañña_. There, however, still remains the _asammoha_-_samjañña_. Before writing on it, **_Upanissaya-Sampanna_** and **_Diṭṭhe diṭṭha mattam_** will be treated with reference to explanations by previous _Aṭṭhakathā_ (commen- tators) and ṭīkā sayādaws.

**_Upanissaya-Sampanna_**

_Tahhta paccekabodhiyā upanissaya sampadā kappānam dve asankheyyāni sata- satasahassañca tijjam puññañā ñāṇa-sambharaṇam_, _sāvaka-bodhiyam eggasāvakānam ekam asañkheyyam kappa satasahassañca, mahāsāvakānam kappa satasahassañmeva_, _itaresam atītāsu jātīsu vivuṭṭasanissayavasena nibbattitam nibbebhāgiyam kusalam_ (Dī.-\*\*\*

*ṭī.-*1: 126, _Ma.- ṭī.-_ 1: 257).

1. To be completely endowed with _upanissaya_, powerful support to _paccekabodhi ñāṇa_, fulfilling *pāramī*s (the perfections) and acquiring meritorious deeds,

relevant to _paccekabodhi ñāṇa_, have to be practiced and cultured for innumerable years and a hundred thousand eons.

2. Among the three *sāvakabodhi ñāṇa*s, special _pāramī kusala_ relevant _aggasāva- kabodhi ñāṇa –_ building up of knowledge – has to be cultivated by *aggasāvaka*s throughout the period of innu-merable years and a hundred thousand eons.
3. To acquire _mahāsāvaka_ *bodhi ñāṇa*s – building up of knowledge, the *mahāsāvaka*s have to culture _pāramī kusala_ relevant to the _mahāsāvaka bodhi_

_ñāṇa_ for hundred thousand eons.

4. To be possessed of the _pakatisāvaka bodhi ñāṇa_ the *pakatisāvaka*s have to cultivate in

the past the _nibbedhabhāgiya_ = the special _pāramī kusala_ that can breakdown the massive _kilesā_, and are said to be endowed with _upanissaya sampanna_ = a powerful _upanissya_ the great support. These can be cultured by virtue of _vivuṭṭa_ the deliverance\*\*\*

from rounds of rebirth as its support (Dī.-\*\* *ṭī.-*1: 126, _Ma.- ṭī.-_ 1: 257). ūū

To be completely endowed with _sāvaka bodhi ñāṇa_, the *pakatisāvaka*s should possess special _nibbedha bodhiya kusala_. It is cultivated in the past as good seeds of _vijjā_ and _carana_, such as the mass of _lobha, dosa, moha_, etc., having the penetrative power of breaking down these massive _kilesā_. This is contrast to the assertion that _pāramī_ is not required in acquiring the _sāvaka bodhi ñāṇa_. According to the above explanations, culture of _dāna, sīla, samatha_, referred to here as the good seeds of _carana_, the destruction of _rûpa- nāma_ to the attainment to knowledge of wisdom in the past to their ultimate realities, are all *nibbedha-bhāgiya kusala*s which help disseminate the mass of _kilesā_. This attainment already of _nibbedha-bhāgiya kusala_ _pāramī_ is a prerequisite for acquiring the _sāvaka bodhi ñāṇa_. Pointing out Saccekka Paribājaka and frog-devā as examples (in story of Maṇṭuka- deva putta), the Reverend Letī Sayādaw has indicated that the _nibbedha-bhāgiya kusala_ _pāramī_ fulfilled in previous two or three exsitences are adequate to acquire the _pakatisāvaka bodhi ñāṇa_. He also exaplined that at least the exercise on the four great elements to the attainment of their ultimate realities has to be accomplished. So much the better if one is possessed of the _nāma-rûpa pariccheda_ _ñāṇa_,

_pacceya pariggaha ñāṇa_ and _vipassanā ñāṇa_.

In association with the story of the Rev Bāhiyadāruciraya Mathera, the Sayādaw has explained the process of exercise _Diṭṭhe Diṭṭhamattam_. Since this process is relevant

to mediation by way of Sampajañña method, a brief description will be made of it.\*

**_Diṭṭhe_ – _Diṭṭhamattam_ Method of Meditation** _Tasamāhita te bāhiya evum sikkhatabbam_ –

“_Diṭṭhe Diṭṭhamattambhavissati, sute sutamattam bhavissati_, _mute mutamattam bhavissati_, _viññāte viññāmattam bhavissatī”ti_. _Evañhi te bātiya sikkhitabbam._

_Yato kho te bāhiya diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattam bhavissati, sute sutamattam bhavissati_, _mute mutamattam bhavissati_, _viññāne viññāmattam bhavissati_, _tato tun bhāhiya na tena_. _Yato tun bāhiyana tena_, _tato tun bhāhiya na tattha_. _Yato tun bhāhiya na tattha_, _tato tun bhāhiya nevidha na huram na ubhayamantarena_. _Esevunto dujjhassāti_ (_Khu_.- 1: 85 – 86, UdānaPāļi).

My dear son Bāhiya …. In thūs _sāsanā_ you should make every effort to concen-trate as given below.

1. If you visualized the _rûpārammana_ by virtue of _cakkhu_-_viññāna_, you should practice just to see.
1. If you hear the _saddhārammana_ by way of _sotaviññāna_,\* you should practice just to hear.
1. If you come into contact with _gandhāramana_ by _ghānaviññāṇa_, _rasārammana_ by _jīvhāviññāṇa_, _phoļabbārammanana_ by *phoļabbāviññāṇa*¸ you should practice just to sense the contact.
1. If you sense the _dhammārammana_ by _manoviññāṇa_, you should practice just to

have the sense of them.

My dear son Bāhiya …. Make effort to meditate in this way. Then, you would be able to acquire the six modes of _ārammana_ which are _diṭṭha-suta-muta_ and _viññāta_ as

given below. ū

1. If you happen to visualize _rûpārammana_ via _cakkhu-viññāna_, then it would be just seeing it.
1. If you happen to hear the _saddhārammana_ by way of _sotaviññāna_, then it would be just bearing it.
1. If you happen to come into contact with _rasārammana_ by _jīvhāviññāṇa_, _phoļabbārammanana_ by *phoļabbāviññāṇa*¸*gandhāramana* by _ghānaviññāṇa_, then it would just be sense of contact.
1. If you happen to sense the _dhammārammana_ by _manoviññāṇa_, you should, it

would then be just having the sense of them

My dear son Bāhiya …. Then you would not have attachment on these ārammana via _rāga_, commit no offence by _dosa_, ignorant by way of _moha_ the nature of the _ārammana_ = no delusion. (Vision, hearing, contact, realization do not occur in associa-

tion with _raga dosa_, and _moha_). Then, my dear son Bāhiya …. There exist in you no _diṭṭha-suta-muta-viññāta_ of _ārammana_ (associated with _rāga_-_dosa_-_moha_).

My dear son Bāhiya …. If there exist no _ārammana_ of _diṭṭha-suta-muta-viññāta_ associated with (associated with _rāga_-_dosa_-_moha_), then they would not also exist in

1. In your present life nor
1. In your life after death, nor
1. In both the present life and life after death.

Their non-existance in both the present and the life after death means the

termination of kilesa-dukkha and ūsamsarā-vuṭṭa dukkha\*. This is what the Buddha has expounded (Khu.-1: 58, UdānaPāļi).

1. **_Diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattanti_** _rûpāyūtaneūcakkhuviññāṇena diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattam_ ū

**\*pī**ti\* _javanaviññāṇehipi_ (_Sam_.-\*\* _ṭī.-_ 2:301 – 3ū2). ūū

According to **_Diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattam_** seeing the _rûpārammana_ by way of _cakkhu_- _viññāna_, try to realize its attributes. In seeing various *rûpārammana*s the _cakkhuviññāna_ does know the color brown, gold etc., nor the nature of _nicca_ and _anicca_, but just that they are colors. In the same way, in concentrating by _cakkhu_-_dvārikaviññāna_, _manodvārikaviññāna_, on the _rûpārammana_, concentrate on (not the various colors) just the state of being colors. This is the real meaning of _Diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattam_. It is the first

method. Not satisfied with the first, a second method wūs exūlained.

2. _Atha vā diṭṭhe diṭṭham nāma cakkhuviññāna_, _rûpe-rûpa-vijjānananti attho_. ū

**\*Mattā**ti pamāṇam*, *diṭṭha mattā assāti diṭṭha mattam*, *cittam cakkhuviññattameva me cittam bhavissati attho*. *Idam vattam hoti – yatthā āpāthagata-rûpe cakkhuviññānam na rijjati na dussati na muyhati*, *evum rāgāvirahena cakkhuviññāṇam mattameva javanam\*

_bhavissati_, _cakkhuviññāṇa pamāūenva javanam ṭṭhapassamīti_ (_Sam_.- \*ṭṭha.ū- 3:ū29). ū

**\*Diṭṭhamnāma cakkhuviññāṇam** rûpāyatanassa dassanti katvā*. *Te nāha ”**rûpa rûpa- vijānenan**”ti\*. **\*Cakkhuviññāṇamattamevā**ti yatthakam cakkhuviññāṇam rûpāteṇa gahaṇa mattam*, *tammattameva me sabbam cittam bhavissatīti attho*. “*Rāgādihiharenā”\*

_ti vāpaūṭho_ (_Sam_.- *ṭī.-*2: 302).

_Ittha rûpāyatanam passitabbadiṭṭhena diṭṭham nāma_, _cakkhuviññāṇam pana saddhim tamdvārikaviññāṇehi dassana ṭṭhena_ (_Udāna_ – _ṭṭha.-_ 92). ūū

According to **_Diṭṭha_** in **_Diṭṭhe_,** make\* sure that **_Diṭṭha_** acquired. It is named\*\* _diṭṭha_ because _cakkhuviññāṇa_ bears the meaning of ability to realize the _rûpārammana_ (the material object). (It means only the color of the _rûpārammana_ is realized).

**_Matta_** refers to a measure of size.

**_Diṭṭhaūatta_** refers to continuity of consciounsness of _javana-vīthi-citta_. (It is the continuity of consciousness of _manodvāra-vīthi-citta_ which continue to have impulsion

of the _rûpārammana_ via _cakkhu-dvāra-vīthi_).

What is reallū means is ‘I will exercise in such a way that the consinuity of the consciousness of _javana-vīthi-ciita_ of mine must have the speed of the magnitude of the _Cakkhuviññāṇa_.

When the _rûpārammana_, acquired through the eye-door, arises, then the _cakkhuviññāṇa_ should not have attachment* (no *raga*), nor offence (no *dosa*), nor ignorant of it real nature (no *moha*). (The mind and mental concomitants which can arise in association during *cakkhuviññāṇa* and a *cittakkhaṇa* are only the seven modes of *sabba*-*cittasādhāraṇa*. The *raga, dosa* and *moha* are not include nor associated with these *nāma\*

*dhamma*s.

In this way the continuity of consciousness of _javana-vīthi-citta_ of the magnitude of _cakkhuviññāṇa_ and free of _rāga_ etc., would be cultivated, and javana citta oū _cakkhu- viññāṇa_ magnitude will be maintained.

Accoding to this annotation the term _diṭṭheū diṭṭhamattam_ mean that just as the _cakkhuviññāṇa_ is not associated with _rāga_, _dosa_ and _moha_, if the _rûpārammaṇa_ is taken as object in continuation, then these _javana-vīthi-citta_ should also be free of _rāga_, _dosa_ and _moha_. (The method of exercise will be given later). A third method has been again annotated by by the _aṭṭhakkathā_.

3. _Attha vā diṭṭham nāma cakkhuviññāṇāne diṭṭha-rûūam_, _diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattam nāma tattheva uppannam sampaṭicchana-santīraṇa-voṭṭhabbana sañkhātam cittattayam_. _Yathā tam na_

_rajjati na dussati na muyhati_, _evum āpāthagate rûpe teneva sampaṭicchanā dippamāṇena javanam uppādassāmi_, _nāham tam pamāṇam atikkamittvā rjjanādivasena_

_uppajjantum dissāmīti ayamittha attho_. _Eseva nayo **ūutamutesu**_\*\* (_Sam_.- _ṭṭha._- 3: 29) ū

**ūDiṭṭham nāma** padatthato cakkhuviññāṇena diṭṭham –rûpam\*. **\*Atthevā**ti cakkhu Viññāūena diṭṭhamatte rûpe\*. **\*Cittattayam** diṭṭhamattam nāma cakkhuviññāṇam viya ragādiviharena pavattanato*. *Tenāha “**yathā tan**”ti ādi* (*Sam*.- *ṭī\*.- 2: 302). ū

_Rûpāyatanam passitabbāṭhena diṭṭham nāma_ (_Upāda_-_ṭṭha_. 82), according to which the _rûpārammaṇa_ is in essence _diṭṭha_ (vission) because of the fact that its realization is made via _cakkhuviññāṇa_ (visual cognition). Therefore, in this third method the _rûpārammana_ which can be perceived by way of _cakkhuviññāṇa_ is the _diṭṭha_. It is just a _matta_ (measure) in visual cognition of the _ārammaṇa_, and in so doing the three *citta*s, referred to as _sampaṭicchana-santīraṇa-vuṭṭho_, arise free of _rāga-dosa-moha_.

Because of this, it is called **_diṭṭhamatta_**. ūū

Just as the combination of the three *citta*s have non-attachment, non-offence, and the non-delusion with regard to the _rûpārammaṇa_, so also in the case of the _rûpā-rammaṇa_ that impinges on the visual cognition. I would cultivate by continuity of consciousness my measure of _sampaṭicchana-santīraṇa-vuṭṭho_ free from _rāga-dosa-moha_. Make effort to with such determination “I would not allow the attachment, offence or delusion to arise overriding the _sampaṭicchana-santīraṇa-vuṭṭho_. This is what it is all about. (This is also true in case of _suta_-_muta_ (what is seen and thought). The way to exercise to get delivered from _raga-dosa- moha_ will be described later) (_Sam_.- _ṭṭha._- 3: 29).

**_Viññāte Viññātamattam_**

**\*Viññāte viññātamattam**ti ettha pana viññātam nāma manodvārāvajjanena viññātā- rammaṇam*, *tassamim viññāte viññātamattanti āvijjanapanāṇam*. *Yathā āvijjanena na rijjati na dussati na muyhati*, *evum rijjanādivasena uppacchitom adatvā āvijjanapamā-\*

_neṇena cittam ṭhapassāmīti ayamettha attho_ (_Sam_.- _ṭṭha._- 3: 29).\*\*\*

**\*Manodvārāvijjanena** **viññātārammanam** viññātanti adhippetam rāgādiviharena viññeyyato*. *Tenāha “**yathā āvajjanenā”**tiādi* (*Sam*.- *ṭī.\*- 2: 302).

 _Viññāta_, as given in _viññāte viññātamattam_ refers to the _ārammaṇa_ that is realized ūū

by virtueū of _manodvārāvajjana_ (advertence to the threshold of mind). [The _manodvārā vajjana_ can take, as object (of thought), each of the six modes of _ārammana_ correspond- dingly. Here, the object refers to that of _vipassanāñāṇa_ called the _dhammārammaṇa_. The inference have been made as _rûpārammana_ from aspect of _diṭṭha_, _saddārammana_ from aspect of _suta_, _gandhā-rammana_, _rasārammana_, and _phoļabbārammana_ from aspect of _muta_. Because of this in asmuchas the _viññāta_ is concerned, _pasāda-rûpa_,

_sukhuma-rûpa_ and _lokī-citta-cetasika_, that should arise in your _santāna_ , the objects of vipassanā, the constituents of _dhammārammana_, should be firmly cultivated. Therefore, the _diṭṭha-suta-muta-viññāta_ refer to all the 6 modes of objects. If complete modes of objects are taken as object of concentration, by means of _vipassanā ñāṇa_, to the attainment of ultimate reality up to elemental state, then there is no more objects of

concentration left.]

In the _ārammana_, called _viññāta_ which realizes by way of _manodvāra-vajjana_, **_viññātamatta_** is the continuity of consciousness having a measure of the _manodvāra-vaj- jana_. As I exercise on the non-attachment, non-offence, non-delusion of the _viññāta_ factors by virtue of _manodvāra-vajjana_, so would I keep the continuity of _javana-citta_ by a measure of _manodāra-vajjana_ (= continuity _manodvārika-javana-vīthi citta_). This is what is meant by _viññāta-mattam_ (_Sam_.- _ṭṭha._- 3: 29).

‘You the gentleman should recollect the _nāma_ _kamaṭṭhāna_’\* is the essence when the explanations above are taken in brief. ū

Concentrate once again on the collection of *cetasika dhamma*s associated with _pañcadvāra-vajjana_ (the five sense doors), _cakkhu-viññāṇa_, the seeing consciousness, (_sota- viññāṇa_, _ghāna-viññāṇa_, _jivhā-viññāṇa_, _kāya-viññāṇa_), _sampaṭicchana, santīraṇa, vattho_ and _manodvāra-vajjana_. The so associated *cetasika*s are entirely free of _raga_, _dosa_, _moha_. Therefore, no mind of attachment, nor of offence, nor of delusion will arise along with _rûpārammaṇa_ or any other related ones. Similar to this practice, make effort to concentrate on the *javana citta*s arising in association with the continuity of the

thought process. How could one practice to be free from _raga_, _dosa_, _moha_?

**_Ñātapariññā Tīranapariññā_** ūū

_Iti bhagavā bāhiyassa samkhitta rucitāya sahi viññāṇakāyahi saddhim saṭṭhārammaṇa- bhedabhinnam vipassanāya vissūyam diṭṭhādīhi catûhi koṭṭhāssehi vibhajitvā tatthassa ñātatīraṇapariññam dasseti_. _Katham?

Ayamettha adhippāyo sidādīsupi_ (_Udāna-ṭha.-_ 82, _Anuṭī-_ 2: 183).

The Buddha expatiated the _dhamma_ in an abridged form to Bāhiya to his liking. The six modes of _ārammaṇa_ – the _rûpārammaṇa_, _saddārammaṇa_, _gandhārammaṇa_, _phoļabbārammaṇa_ and _dhammārammaṇa_ – together with the 6 modes of _viññāṇa – cakkhuviññāṇa_, _sotaviññāṇa_, _ghānaviññāṇa_, _jīvhāviññāṇa_, _kāyaviññāṇa_ and _manoviññā-ṇa_. The six modes of _ārammaṇa_, the objects of _vipassanāñāṇa_, are taken as

1. _Diṭṭha dhamma_
1. _Suta dhamma_
1. _Muta dhamma_
1. _Viññāta dhamma_

which are the six modes of _kuṭṭhāsa_ = make analysis by group by group. Bāhiya has been instructed to exercise on _ñātapariññā_ and _tīranapariññā_ from among the six modes

of _viññāṇa_ and the six modes of _ārammaṇa_.

In way was the instruction madū? See the following
ūū

1. Because of the fact that _rûpārammaṇa_ can be seen by _cakkhuviññāṇa_, it is called _diṭṭha_. It is a phenomenon that can be discerned. ū
1. _Cakkhudvārikavīthi_, the eye door thought process (_manodvārikavīthi citta_ which continued taking _rûpārammaṇa_ as the object of concentration), together with _cakkhuviññāṇa_, bears the meaning of _diṭṭha_ because of its ability to discern the _ārammaṇa_. These are phenomenal groups that have the ability to discern. (These words indicate the _nāma-rûpapariccheda_-_ñāṇa_ – analytical knowledge of mind and matter).
1. The discerned and the discerning phenomena are just ones that can arise only when conditioned by relevant causes. In these phenomena, there are no _atta_ (self) that could create nor the created. (These words describe how one could culture the discerned and the discerning phenomena by virtue of _paccaya-pariggaha_- _ñāṇa_. The _nāma-rûpapariccheda_-_ñāṇa_ and _paccaya-pariggaha- ñāṇa_ are, infact, the _ñāta- pariññā_.)
1. The discerned and the discerning groups, arising by relevant causes, are of just a phenomenal nature. The are the *dhamma*s the bears the nature of

1) _anicca_ (impermanence) as they arise and then perish away
1) _dukkha_ (suffering) as they exert relentless torturing and suffering
1) _anatta_ (non-self) as they never arise in the way one wishes them to be.

If you, a gentleman, have been exercising _vipassanā_ on the three-fold characters as above, there is no way the _raga_, _dosa_, and _moha_ can arise in your _santāna_. This is, indeed, the actual meaning of the terms _diṭṭhe_ and _diṭṭhamattam_ in this _sāsanā_. It is also true for _suta-muta-vita_. (With these words the _sammasanañāṇa_ and _udayabbayañāṇa_, referred to as _tīraṇapariññā_, have been stated). (Transaltion has been made as given in

_Anuṭī-_ 2: 183, **_Ayañhettha adhippāyo_, _esa nayo sutādīsup_**).

**Meditation in Brief** ū

1. **_Diṭṭha_** (a) Discernible *dhamma*s or phenomena = _rûpārammaṇa_

(b) Discerning *dhamma*s = *cakkhudvāravīthi, manodvāravīthi dhamma*s of _nāma dhamma_ groups

2. **_Suta_** (a) Heard *dhamma*s = _saddārammaṇa_

(b) Hearing *dhamma*s = *sotadvāravīthi, manodvāravīthi dhamma*s of

 _nāma dhamma_ groups

3. **_Muta_** (a) Contact *dhamma*s – 1. _Gandhāramaṇa_
4. _Rasāramaṇa_
5. _Phoļabbāramaṇa_

(b) Contacting *dhamma*s 1. _Ghānadvāravīthi_ – _Manodvāravīthi nāma_ _dhamma_ groups

2. _Jīvhādvāravīthi_ – _Manodvāravīthi nāma_

 _dhamma_ groups

3. _Kāyadvāravīthi_ – _Manodvāravīthi nāma_

 _dhamma_ groups

4. **_Viññāta_** (a) Realized *dhamma*s – _Dhammāramaṇa_

(b) Realizing *dhamma*s – _Manodvāravīthi nāma-dhamma_ groups ū

First of all, try to concentrate on the above four modes – *diṭṭha-suta-muta-viññāta dhamma*s – the massive *rûpa*s and *nāma*s to their ultimate realities, and analyze

by virtue of _nāṇa._ (This method of cūncentration explained _sensu lato_ in previously).

Then try to find the causes of these *rûpa*s and *nāma*s, and concentrate on the caūsal relationship. (It will be clear in _Paticcasamuppāda_ and _Paccaya-pariggha nāṇa_ section).

Then again exercise vipassanā on the three characters of the cause together with *rûpa- nāma dhamma*s. (It will be clear in section on Vipassanā). After this, the Buddha

instructed Bāhiya works to be continued beginning with a phrase **_Yato kho te Bāhiya_ –**

**To the _Pahānapariññā_ Destination**

_Idāni ñātīraṇapariññāsu patiṭṭhitassa upari saha maggaphalena pahānapariññam dassetum “**yato kho te Bāhiyā**”tiādi āraddham_ (_Udāna_-_ṭṭha.-_ 82*, Anuṭī-* 2: 183).

With reference to this statement when _diṭṭha-suta-muta-viññāta_ *dhamma*s have been contemplated to the attainment of _udabbayañāṇa_, _vipassanā_ concentration must be made on _bhañgañāṇa_ to acquire higher _vipassanā_ _ñāṇa_ and _magga-ñāṇa_ and _phaļa-ñāṇa_ (It will become clear in section on Vipassanā). With a view to the attainment of the _arahatta-phaļa-ñāṇa_, the Buddha exhorted to Bāhiya the following.

My son Bāhiya ….Exert your effort to concentrate this this way. Suppose that sometimes you might just discern, hear, touch, realize the phenomena _diṭṭha-suta-muta- viññāta_. And also suppose the you would not have attachment with _raga_, nor offence with _dosa_ nor _moha_ on the _diṭṭha-suta-muta-viññāta_ *dhamma*s. (Inability to discern these *dhamma*s to the attainment of their _paramatta_, or failure to acquire _viapssanā_ _ñāṇa_ is

said to be deluted). ū

My son Bāhiya …. Sometimes it might happen that you are not attached with _raga_, nor offend with _dosa_, nor delutioned with _moha_, on the _diṭṭha-suta-muta-viññāta_ *dhamma*s. Then you will not be associated with these three, then you would not have _raga_, _dosa_ and _moha_ on _diṭṭha-suta-muta-viññāta_ *dhamma*s. [**_Ettha vatā pahānapariñām mattakam pāpattatvā khīṇāsavabhûmi dassitā_** = With this much words, the Lord has shown the plane of Arahants who have peaked in attaining the\*\* _pahānapariññā_, and in

whom _kilesā_ (defilement) and _āsava_ (canker) have been eradicated (_Udāna_- *ṭṭha.-*82)]

Then, my son Bāhiya …. These will not arise in you

1. In _paccuppana loka_ (the present realm of existence)
1. In next existence (life after death)
1. In the present and next existences.

The Buddha has expounded that not arising in the present and the next existences indicate the end of suffering from defilement and of the rounds of rebirth (_Khu_.-1: 85-86).

-   The Buddha Rev Bāhiya-Dārucūya Mathera has fulfilled his _pāramī_ for attainment of _Khippabhiñña Etadañga_ for a hundred thousand eons commencing from the time of the Buddha Padumuttara, especially cultivating an Arahant’s _dhamma_ for twenty thousand years, and lastly exercising the _vipassanā_ on top of a mountain at the risk of his life. One must be careful not to compare one’s newly acquired _pāramī_, still in in its young state, with the matured and longed acquired _pāramī_ of the Mathera. In this case the _pāramī_ plays an important role. The Rev Bāhiya-Dāruciya Mathera is a Khippābiñña Arahant who has acquired _Paṭisambhidā ñāṇa_ (discrimatory knowledge)_._ The noble ones who have cultured _Paṭisambhidā ñāṇa_ have performed, during the time of early Buddhas’ _sāsanā_, the functions of _gatipaccāgatikavatta_ and have practiced _vipassanā_ meditation to

the attainment of _sañkhā_-_rûpakkhā ñāṇa_ (Visuddhi- 2: 72).

Realization without confusion of the _paramatta_ in going forward or backward is known as the **_asammohasampajañña_.** Now understand _asammohasampajañña_ in the

way as given below.

Lacking eye of wisdom for _paramatta_, the _andhabāla_-_puthujana_ (the blind stupid worldling) would understand, with _tahnā diṭṭhi_, going forward etc. as _atta_ (self), _atta_ would make going forward possible, or “I am going forward,I would make myself go

forward. ūūūūūū

The yogāvacara (meditator) recluse who belives in the Buddha’s Sāsanā, who has succeeded in culturing _rûpa_ and _nāma_ masses by breaking them down to ultimate reality by means of _ñāṇa_ (Ghanavitabbhogena – _Sī_-_ṭī_ – 246), would not have confusion, nor wrong view like the blind stupid man. In the recluse if realization of “going” arises in his mind together with the _cittasamuṭṭhāna_ _vāyodhātu_, included in the* mind-produced *kalāpa*s, will cause body behavior = *kāyaviññatta*-*rûpa* to arise in him. Because of the spread throughout the body of mind-produced, and having high natural powers, *rûpa*-*kalāpa*s of the *vāyodhātu*, the *rûpa*-*kāya* = all the *rûpa dhamma*s as noted in the field of *paramatta*-*saccā* (taken as all the *catusamuṭṭhānika rûpa dhamma*s in the field of *para*-*matta saccā*), the going forward as the whole skeletal mass moves forward. (Speaking by language of *sammuti*-*saccā\*, moving forward can happen only when the bones and the

corresponding joints are strong.) ū

1. The realization of going forward by _paramatta_-_saccā_ is forward movement of the all the *rûpa dhamma*s and of the bones and corresponding joints by _sammuti saccā_. In each raising of a leg = going upward, the _tiharaṇa_, become inferior, weak and without force. But _tejo dhātu_ and _vāyo dhātu_ become superior and full of strength. (The raising and lowering of the leg in each step will be referred to as “raising.”). the same applies to the following two.
1. Directed forward – _atiharaṇa_
1. Swinging the leg = bring the leg back to its usual position – _vītiharaṇa_.

[*Tejo dhātu*, which always follows the *vāyo dhātu*, is the cause of rasing and lowering the leg for which the two *dhātu*s are described as being preeminent. Indeed the *tejo dhātu* has the nature of raising the leg up and bringing it high up. That in rasing the *tejo dhātu* has the nature of always following the *vāyo dhātu* is quite evident. The commentator has explained in such a way as to make explicitly of the preeminence of *vāyo* *dhātu* and *tejo dhātu*, following the former, in rasing the leg and inferiority and weakness of the *pathavī dhātu* and *āpo dhātu* at the same time. Again the *tejo dhātu*, which always follows the *vāyo dhātu*, are the cause of leading forward = *atiharaṇa*, swinging sideways and bringing back =* rasing and lowering the leg = *vītiharaṇa*. In fact, there is excessive power together with anxiety in *atiharaṇa* and *vītiharaṇa* of the *vāyo dhātu* that tends to go athwart. In this way, the fact that *tejo dhātu* always follows the *vāyo dhātu* always holds true. Going beyond the place of standing = carry forward beyond standing leg is ***atiharaṇa***. Swinging the leg from standing position away to avoid a stumbling block or a stump is ***vītiharaṇa***. In other words, bring the leg back to the standing position is the ***atiharaṇa***, and moving the leg forward or sideways from the standing position is ***vītiharaṇa*** (*Thī*-*ṭī-* 247)*.* Designated in this way, note that the *atiharaṇa* can be shortened as “lift” and *vītiharaṇa* as “swing.”]

**_Vosajjana_** In liftng of the leg (the stepping leg), the _tejo dhātu_ and _vāyo dhātu_ are inferior, weak and are of no strtength. The _pathāvī_ and *āpo dhātu*s are very powerful and energetic. Note that the same applies to the action of lowering down the leg = **_sanikkhepana_**, set the leg on the ground = **_sannirujjhana_** have been differentiated. (In stepping, sending off of the leg forward to press down is the _vosajjana_, the act of putting the leg on the ground or the floor is the\*\* _sanikkhepana_. Pressing down the leg for a next

step is the _sannirujjhana_. (the whole processes has been shortened as the Lift-carry-

carrying in between-release -down-press)

1. _Uddharaṇa_ = lift
1. _Atiharaṇa_ = carry (back to place of standing)
1. _Vītiharaṇa =_ carrying in between (between first and second step)
1. _Vossajjana_ = release (lowers the lifted leg for next step)
1. _Sanikkhepana_ = set leg on the ground
1. _Sanūirujjhana_ = press on the ground (to carry the other leg forward) ūūūūū

The _rûpa_ and _nāma_ *dhamma*s, the real _paramatta_, arising at the moment of the _uddharaṇa_ = lifting the leg off the ground, would be not carried on leading to the moment of _atiharaṇa_ = leg standing on the ground. Nor the _rûpa_ and *nāma dhamma*s arising at the moment of carrying on to _vītiharaṇa_ = the moment of taking over. In the same way, the _rûpa_ and *nāma dhamma*s arising at the moment of taking over to moment are not carried on leading to _vossajjana_, nor its _rûpa_ and *nāma dhamma*s to that of _sanikkhepana_, nor its _rûpa_ and *nāma dhamma*s to _sanikkhepana_. The _rûpa_ and *nāma dhamma*s arising at the moment of _sanikkhepana_ do not get carried to the moment of the

_sannirujjhana_.

Only at a particular place, at a particular moment, section by section, joint by joint the movements are arising and disappearing like sesame seeds placed on a hot iron plate. [***Khaṇamattā vaļānato*** (*Sī*- *ṭī*- 248) statūc only for a moment as *Upāda*-*ṭhī-Bhañga* (arising-static-perishing away).]

In going forward and drawing back, which is the individual or a sentient being that is making such a movement? Who is going forward, or making a movement forward? No one. It is just the continuous process of the mass of _rûpa_ and _nāma_

*dhaūma*sūmoving repetitively forward and backwaūd in new places. ū

**\*Rûpā rûpadūammā**ti uddharaṇākārena pavattā rûpadhammā*, *tamsamuṭṭhāpatā arûpadhammo ca* (*Sī*- *ṭī*- 247, ūMa*- _ṭī_-1 : 358). ūūū

Here the _rûpa_ and _nāma_ *dhamma*s of lifting the leg are, in fact, the _padhāna_ (essential) _rûpa dhamma_ or _apadhāna_ (non-essential) _rûpa_ _dhamma_, i.e. the _rûpa dham_ *-ma*s, in which are _citta_ _samuṭṭhāna_ *dhamma*s and which have the nature of the lifting, and those which are being lifted. And these are the *nāma dhamma*s. what it means is that the _rûpa_ and _nāma_ *dhamma*s arising at each moment of the lift-carry-carrying in between-release -down-press process, section by section, joint by joint process should be

analytically discerned individually by virtue of _ñāṇa_.

For this reason the _Aṭṭhūkathā_ has explained as given below. Indeed, moving when viewed from _Paramattha-dhamma-sabhāva_:
ū

1. In moving it is the *rûūa dhātu*s and _nāma_ *dhātu*s only which are going.
1. In standing it is the *rūpa dhātu*s and _nāma_ *dhātu*s only which are standing still.
1. In sitting it is the *rûpa dhātu*s and _nāma_ *dhātu*s only which are sitting.
1. In sleeping it is the *rûpa dhātu*s and _nāma_ *dhātu*s only which are ūleeping.

The moving, stopping, sitting and sleeping are *kuṭṭhāsa*s in which the _rûpa_ and *nāma dhamma*s to gether with –

1. Other _citta_ has ceased.
1. Still other _citta_ has arisen anew.

Take to heart, and concentrate by analytical knowledge that the process takes ū

place continuously in this way. Understanding of the moving forward and backward of the *rûpa dhamma*s and *nāma dhamma*s to the attainment of their _paramattha_ is called _asammuyhana_ = realization without confusion = realizing the true nature. Then be sure to understand that realizing the _paramattha_ of these *dhamma*s without confusion is the **_asammoha-sampazañña_**.

Here then, explanation on the real meaning of the _abhikkante paṭikkante sampazānakāri hoti_ = the action of going forward or backward is usually made with _sampazañña_ _ñāṇa_ has come to an end (_Abhi._- _ṭṭha_ – 2: 339, _Ma_- _ṭī_-1 : 265).

The method of meditation is similar to that of _Irriyāpatha_ described in section on _Nāma_ Kammatthāna.

**_ālokite vilokite sampajānakāri hoti_**

Looking straight and looking sideways are made with _sampajañña ñāṇa_.

Looking to front = looking straight ahead is termed _ālokita_. Looking sideways = glancing is known as _vilokita_. Looking up, down or back do not conform to devotion and respectable grace of a recluse, for which reason the Buddha did not expatiated. Only these two kinds of looking conforms to an Arahant’s life. In other words, all kinds of looking are led by the forward looking and looking sideways, are taken collectively as

seeing (_Abhi._- _ṭṭha_ – 2: 339 - 340, _Ma_- _ṭī_-1 : 265 - 266).

**1. _Satthakasampajañña_**

In the act of looking forward or sideways, if a will arises in one to do so, one should be careful to consider if the seeing (the object) is of fruitful or not before actually doing so. The ability to discriminately discern in this way is termed the **_satthaka-sampajañña_**. How this _sampajañña_ come into being should be understood by referring to

Rev Ãnūnda Mathera. With regard to this, the Buddha has expounded as given below. ū

Bhikkhûs ---- Suppose a _nanda_ _Aranhant_ (dear recluse) is about to look toward the east. He did so first of all realizing that he has no intention of attaching to the _rûpā_-_rammaṇa_

-   _abhijjhā_ (wrongful thought) factor, grief = _domanassa_ factor which are of inferior nature and _akusala dhamma_, would not arise in him. After taking all these serially appearing factors to the heart, then he would look toward the east. In this way, the recluse is endowed with the _sampajañña_ _ñāṇa_ by which discrimination of beneficial or not of looking east is made. The beneficial aspect is discriminated by the _sampajañña_

*ñāṇa*ū

Bhikkhûs ---- if a _nanda_ _Aranhant_ is

1. About to look west. R.
1. About to look north. R.
1. About to look south. R.
1. About to look up. R.
1. About to look down. R.
1. About to look to corner. R. ū

 Suppose a _nanda_ _Aranhant_ is about to look to a corner . He did so first of all realizing that he has no intention of attaching to the _rûpā_-_rammaṇa_ = _abhijjhā_ (wrongful thought) factor, grief = _domanassa_ factor which are of inferior nature and _akusala dhamma_, would not arise in him. After taking all these serially appearing factors to the heart, then he would look to the corner. In this way, the recluse is endowed with the _sampajañña_ _ñāṇa_ by which discrimination of beneficial or not of looking east is made.

The beneficial aspect is discriminated by the _sampajañña_ _ñāṇa_ ( _Am-_ 3: 14, _Abhi._- _ṭṭha_ –

2: 340, _Ma_- _ṭī_-1 : 266).

When the venerable Nanda Mathera exercising _vipassanā bhāvana_, he has in mind “I have come to a state where I fail to observe these *indariya*s and consciousness based on which I have the perverted thought of unhappiness in the _sāsanā_. It has been a shame. From now on, I would relinquish these failures.” In this way, he become possessed of _ussāha_ (diligence), powerful shamefulness and frightfulness the _hiri-uttappa_ phenomena. In observing that _indriya_, he has fulfilled the _paramī_ for hundred thounsand eons for which he has come to possess _adhikāra kusala_. Because of this possession, he has attained the peak in _indriyasamvara_ the observation on the _indriya_. For this reason

the Lord has expounded to _nanda_-_arahanūs_ as follows.

_Etadaūgam bhikkave mama sāvakānam bhikkhûnam indriyeysu guttadvārānam yadidam nando_ (_Am_.-1: 26).

Bhikkhûs …. Among my disciples, who are mindful of and who observed the security of the _indriya_, the recluse Nanda is the best and the noblest of all. He is regarded

as the _Etadañga_ (_Dī_-_ṭī-_ 1: 249).

2. **_Satthakasampajañña – Sappāyasampajāñña_ In Another Way**

In another way, as in going forward and backward, understand **_satthakasam-pajañña_** as well as **_sappāyasampajāñña_** by virtue of seeing a _cetiya_ (shrine) etc. (_Abhi_-_ṭṭha_-2: 340).

3. **_Gocarasampajañña_**

\*Kamaṭṭhāṇassa pana avijahanameva **gocarasampajaññam\***. _Tassamā khandhā- dhātuāyatanakamaṭṭhāṇikehi attano kamaṭṭhāṇavaseneva_, _kasiṇādikammaṭṭhānikehi vā pana kamaṭṭhāna siseneva ālokanavilokanam kātabbam_ (_Abhi_-_ṭṭha_-2: 340, _Ma_- _ṭṭha_-1:

266).

Not abandoning the _kamaṭṭhāna_ that you are always exercising only is the _gocarasampajañña_. Therefore –

1. A recluse contemplating on the five-fold _khandhā_, the _khandhakammaṭṭhānika_ individuals, when looking straight forward or sideways, should concentrate only

 on the five-fold _khandhā_

2. A recluse contemplating on the 12 modes of _āyatana_, the _āyatana kammaṭṭhānika_ individuals, concentrate on 4 *āyatana*s when looking straight forward, 4 *āyatana*s when looking sideways. (It will be clear in later sections).
3. An arahant contemplating on the 18 modes of _dhātu_, the _dhātukammaṭṭhānika_ individuals, concentrate on the 4 *dhātu*s when looking straight forward, the 4 *dhātu*s when looking sideways. (It will be clear in later sections).
4. An arahant concentrating on _kasiṇa_ (sign), _kasiṇādika_ individuals, concentrate on only the usual _kasiṇakamaṭṭhāna_.
5. If a meditator contemplating on _ānāpānassati samādhi,_ the _ānāpānakamaṭṭhānika_ individual, then look straight forward or sideways led by _ānāpānasatipaṭṭhāna_

 (mindfulness of in-breathing and out-breathing).

 What the above all mean is that if your meditation is at _samatha_ stage only, then concentrate on the _samatha_ _kamaṭṭhāna_ you are cultivating when you looking front or sideways. In the same way, if your meditation is at _vipassanā_ stage, then concentrate on any one the five-fold _khandhā_, 12 modes of _āyatana_, the 18 modes of _dhātu_ etc., that you are culturing. If you are meditating in this way, then you are a competent _gocara_-_sampajañña_. According to these explanations, one can be said to be competent in

_gocarasampajañña_ as given below.

Suppose a gentleman only at the stage of cultivating _samādhi_, is concentrating on his _samatha_ _kamaṭṭhāna_ while moving to the front or the back, then he can be as

competent with _gocarasampajañña_.

If a gentleman has acquired _samādhi_, based on which he progressed towards the _vipassanā_. By exercising _vipassanā_ he moved to the front or to the back while discerning the _khandhā_, _āyatana_, and *dhātu*s – discerning on the _khandhā_, _āyatana_, and *dhātu*sa stage of acquiring the knowledge in their _paramatta_,* then the *gocarasam-\*

_pajañña_ and _asamohasampajañña_ will be established in his _santāna_.

**4. _Asamohasampajañña_** ū

Within the body there is no such a thing as _atta_ that is forward-looking, nor the backward-looking _atta_. If a consciousness arises having an intension of looking straight forward, then together with that consciousness arise the mind-produced _citta_ _samuṭṭhāna_ a _viññatta rûpa_, caused by _vāyo_ _dhātu_ which is highly powerful with natural energy, will arise. In this way, by virtue of the mind-derived _citta_, the lower eye-lid is pulled down, the upper eye-lid pulled up (= rises, blown out of course). There, indeed is no one who has opened (make it open) the eye mechanically. Then, the _cakkhu-viññāṇa_ arises making the function of vision accomplished. Understanding discriminatively in this way is called _asamohasampajañña_ in _ālokite_ (looking forward) and _vilokite_ (looking

backward) (_Abhi_-_ṭṭha_-2: 340, _Ma_- _ṭṭha_-1: 266). ū

[N.Bū It is said that *cakkhu-viññāṇa-citta* arises following the function of seeing. So this *cakkhu*-*viññāna* cannot arise without *pañca-dvāra* preceding it, without *sampaṭic-chana- santiraṇa-vuṭṭho* following it, if it is *mahantāramman* without *javana* and if it is *atimahantaja*-*vana* without *javana tadārammana*. So, cultivate in your *cakkhu*-*viññāṇa* the *cakkhudvāravīthi* *nāma* collections and *rûpārammaṇa* which are not free from the *avinābhāva* ways. The Aṭṭhakathā Sayādaw, willing you to cultivate this way, has once again indicated as given below.]

**_Mûlapariññā_**

**(The Root of Analytical Knowledge)**

In another way – ū

1. By virtue of _mūlapariññāna_
1. By virtue of _āgantu =_ of a guest
1. By virtue of _mûlapariññā_
1. By virtue of _tāvakālika_ = of momentary existence ū

Understand the **_asamohasampajañña_** inūlooking ahead and sideways. First of all how the **_asamohasampajañña_** arises by virtue of _mûlapariññā_ will be described.

In looking straight or glancing at the _rûpārammana_, (_Bhavañaga_) the thought process arise in order of _pañcadvāra-vajjana_, _cakkhuviññāna_, _sampaticchana_, _santīraṇa_,

_vuṭṭho, javana_.

Among those *citta*s, the _bhavañga_ is the _vīthimutta_-_citta_ free of _vīthi_. The _bhava_ (life) between the period of birth to death is called _uppapatti bhava_. The _bhavañga_ arises at a time when the _vīthi_-*citta*s of the _bhava_, called _uppapatti_, have not arisen yet. They

help accompliūh continuity memtal processes of the causal factors of a _bhava_.

When the _rûpārammaṇa_ falls on the _cakkhudvāra_ and _manodvāra_, the _mano- dvārāvajjana citta_, called _kiriya_-_manodhātu citta_, arises completing discerning _āvajjana_

by activating (= stop) the _bhavañga_. ū

The _cakkhuviññāṇa_ arises by discerning this _rûpārammaṇa_ following perishing aways of the _cūkkhuviññāṇa_.

The _sampaticchana_,* called *vipāka-mano dhātu*, arises after completing discerning the same *rûpārammaṇa*, which is the function of *sampaticchana\*, and following the

cessation of _cakkhuviññāṇa citta_. ū

Because of the cessation of _cakkhuviññāṇa_, the _santīraṇa citta,_ called _vipāka- mano citta dhātu_ arises after completing thū investigating of the same _rûpārammaṇa_.

Because of the cessation of, the _vuṭṭho citta_, called _kiriyamano viññāṇa dhātu_, arises following the determination of the _rûpārammaṇa_ either as _iṭṭha_ or _aniṭṭha_.

The seven modes of _javana_ are apperceived after cessation of _vuṭṭho_ _citta_. ū

Among the seven _javana_, looking straight and sideways as “this is the woman, this is the man” by virtue of attachment, defilement and delusion, have not arisen even in the first, nor the second nor the 7th *javana*s. If the 7 *javana*s got disarrayed, upside down, then looking straight and sideways, as “this ūs the woman, this is the man,” by virtue of attachment, defilement and delusion, arises. In looking to the front or sideways, realization of _asaūmoha sampajañña_ must be made by virtue of **_mûlapariññā_** (_Abhi_-*ṭṭha-*2: 341). ū

What the above means is as follows. In _cakkhudvāravīthi_ etc. of the _pañcadvāra_- _vīthi_, the understanding and realization, such as “ woman and man,” by way of the attachment etc. has not occurred yet. In that _pañcadvāravīthi_, there occurred the rising of just the _lobha_ such as the _iṭṭha_ _rûpārammaṇa_ of a woman by virtue of _ayoniso manasikāra_ (unwise attention) of the _pañcadvāravajjana_ and _vuṭṭho_. In discerning the _aniṭṭha rûpārammaṇa_ of a woman, just the obdurateness of mind _paṭigha_ arises. (It is not that realization of man and woman induce _raga_, _dosa_ and _moha_, but just that the color as the _rûpārammaṇa_ resulting in the appearance of _lobha_, _dosa_ and _moha_ do

happen). ūū

_Mūnodvāre pana_ “_iṭṭhī puriso_”_ti_ _rajjanādi hoti_. _Tassa pañcadvāravajjanam mûlam_. _Yathāvuttam vā sabbam bhavañgādi_. _Evum manodvāravajjanassa mûlavasena_

_mûla pariññā vuttā_ (*Dī- ṭī-*1: 250).\*

But in _manodvāravīthi_ attachment, offence and delusion arise by realization such as “this is the man, this is the woman.” (Only at the _manodvāravīthi_ did the realization, by way of attachment by _raga_, offence by _dosa_ and delusion by _moha_, arise as

discrimination of “the woman, and man.” Refer to earlier parts of this section).

The root of the causal factors for the arising of the _manodūāravīthi_, in which are included the _lobhajavana_, _dosajavana_ and _mohajavana_ such as the attaching, offending and deluting, are the _javana_. In other words, they are the process of _pañcadvāravīthi_ together with the _bhavañga_. The realization analytically of *pañcadvāravīthi*s by virtue of

roots of the causes of the _manodvāra javana_ is called **_mûlapariññā_**. ū

In _ālokite_ and _vilokite_ = looking to the front and sideways, the _aṭṭhakathā_ has instructed to realize the formation of _asamoha-sampajana_ by virtue of the _mûlapariññā_.

In looking this way, the following have to be concentrated analytically to the knowledge

of their _paramatta_.
ū

1. _Cakkhudvārvīthi_ = _citta_ + _cetasika_ (mind and mentalconcomitants) = *nāma dhamma*s
1. *Manodvāravīthi nāma dhamma*s which still take _rûpārammaṇa_ as the _ārammaṇa_ (the object of meditation).ū

If the meditator can concentrate in the way given above, then he has acquired the _asamoha-sampajana_ by virtue of the _mûlapariññā_.

**_Upalakkhaṇa_ method and _Nidassana_ Method**

As the components were to be appreciated, so are the composite of the compo-nents and such a method of realization is termed the **_upalakkhaṇa_** method. As a distinct part was indicated to be taken, the way of taking the whole of the parts are termed the

**_nidassana_** method. ū

In _sampajañña_, the Buddha has instructed to concentrate on _cakkhudvāravīthi_ and *manodvāravīthi nāma dhamma*s which ūake _rûpārammaṇa_ as the object when looking straight or sideways. The instruction is as follows.

The instruction was made to meditate on a certain obvious component referred to as _nāma dhamma_ group which have the _rûpārammaṇa_ as the object. This _desanā_, there-

fore, expounded in _upalakkhaṇa_ way which can take all the six modes of _ārammaṇa_ as objects in a befitting way, that all the *nāma dhamma*s as a composite have to be concen- trated. This is the _lakkhaṇāhārenitti_ method given in Nittipāļi as follows.

_Vuttamhi ekadhamme_, *yedhammā ekalakkūaṇā tena, Vuttā bhavunti sabbe*ū _iti vutto lakkhaṇo hāro_.

Among the six modes of _ārammaṇa, nāmarûpa dhamma_ groups which take _rûpāram-maṇa_ as the object, are instructed to concentrate on the _nāma dhamma_ groups which takes the six- fold _ārammaṇa_ as object. In one way it means that, being similar in taking _ārammaṇa_ as object, the _nāma dhamma_ groups such as _sotadvāravīthi_ etc., should also

be concentrated upon in meditation. ūū

**_Avinābhāva_ Way**. As the instruction has been made to concentrate on the _nāma dhamma_ groups which take on _rûpārammaṇa_ as the object, this is the way in which _rûpārammaṇa_ and the corresponding objects, not free from _vipassanā bhāvanā_, are to be cultivated. It is because, in a realm of the five-fold _khandhā_, called _pañcavokāra_, they are not free from respective objects and from dependent materials. For this reason the commentator himself will again instruct in _ālokite vilokite_ that the five-fold _khandhā_ are

to be concentrated. (It wūll become clear later). Concentrate on the following when –  
ū

1. In discerning on the _rûpārammṇa_ as indicated in _ālokite vilokite_ ū
1. The _rûpārammṇa_ and corresponding material phenomenon
1. Similar to the way to concentrating on the _cakkhudvāravīthi_ – _manodvāravīthi_, the _nāma dhamma_ groups, which take _rûpārammṇa_ as object
1. In hearing = _saddārammṇa_
1. The _saddārammṇa_ and corresponding material phenomenon
1. Concentrating on the _sotadvāravīthi_ – _manodvāravīthi_, the _nāma dhamma_ groups, which take _saddārammṇa_ as object
1. In smell = _gandhārammṇa_
1. The _gadhārammṇa_ and corresponding supporting material phenomenon
1. Concentrating on the _ghānadvāravīthi_ – _manodvāravīthi_, the _nāma dhamma_ groups, which take _gandhārammṇa_ as object
1. In sensation of taste = _rasārammṇa_
1. The _rasārammṇa_ and corresponding supporting material phenomenon
1. Concentrating on the _rasādvāravīthi_ – _manodvāravīthi_, the _nāma dhamma_ groups, which take _rasārammṇa_ as object
1. In sensation of touch or contact = _phoļabbārammaṇa_
1. The _phoļabbārammṇa_ and corresponding supporting material phenomenon
1. Concentrating on ūhe _kāyadvāravīthi_ – _manodvāravīthi_, the _nāma dhamma_ groups, which take _phoļabbārammṇa_ as object

(D) In realizing _rûpa-nāma_ singly or in groups

1. The _phoļabbārammṇa_ and corresponding supporting material phenomenon
1. Concentrating on the _dhammādvāravīthi_ – _manodvāravīthi_, the _nāma dhamma_ groups, which take _dhmmārammaṇa_ as object

**The Nature of _Ãgaūtuka_ (The Nautre of Avisitor)**

Again, if the the _rûpārammṇa_ has attained stage of being discerned at the ūcakkhu*- *dvāra* (and *manodvāra*), the moving *bhañga* = at later stage above the formation of the *bhavañga*-*calana* (it means the ceased *bhavañga* = stationary *bhavañga* = *bhavañgupaccheda*), and their respective functions accomplished, by virtue of which the *pañca*-*dvāravajjana*, *cakkhuviññāṇa*, *sampaṭicchana, santīraṇa*, and *vuṭṭho* all have arisen and perished away. At the end of all these, *javana* (impulsion) arises. This *javana* is like the home to the previously arisen *pañca*-*dvāravajjana*, for which it is like a visitor to the *cakkhudvāra*. If the hosts remain silent towards the visitor, who came into to ask for something, he should not make a demand for what he wanted. In the same way, the *cakkhudvāra*, the home for these *āvajjana* (*pañcadvāravajjana*) etc., the *vīthi*-*citta\*s (thought

processes) should not be attached, nor offend, nor delusioned towards the _rûpā-rammaṇa_, and so should the _javana_ be towards these *ārammaṇa*s. Understand the _asammoha_- _sampajjaññā_ in the way what happened to the visitor (_Abhi_-_ṭha_-2: 341; _Ma-_

_ṭha_-1: 267). ūūū

_Pañcadvāravajjana_, _cakkhuviññāṇa_, _sampaṭicchana, santīraṇa_, and _vuṭṭho_ could realize just the color of a _rûpārammaṇa_, and *javana vīthi*s could also arise having the same properties. If the concentration can be made of the _javana_ together with _cakkhudvāravīthi nāma dhamma_ groups, which can realize just these colors, to the attain-ment and disintegration of the masses to their _paramatta_, then one said to have acquired the _asamoha- sampajañña_. A meditator should make every effort to acquire the _asamoha_-_sampajaññāṇa_. As a visitor did not have attachment nor offence other’s material things, so should a meditator attempt concentration. In addition, if _āvajjana_ and _vuṭṭho_, included in the _cakkhudvāravīthi_, is taken to heart these _rûpārammaṇa_ by _ayonisomanasikāra_ (wrong attention), then, it will be influenced by _lobha-vajjana_, _dosa-javana_, and _moha-javana_, as the case may be. The arising of these *javana*s is not due to _lobha-vajjana_, _dosa-javana_, and _moha-javana_ produced by realizations as “this is the woman or the man.” This is only due to attachment, offence, or delusion based on the realization by _ayonisomanasikāra_ of only the color of the _rûpārammaṇa_. It is also not like attachment, offence or delusion on the living and non-living material bodies of a house owner on his possessions. It is but like those of a visitor on the possession of his host. If contemplation could be made by a meditator of these _cakkhudvāravīthi_, in which are included the _lobha-vajjana_, _dosa-javana_, and _moha-javana_, to their ultimate realities (_paramatta_), then _asamoha-sampajaññāṇa_ would be attained. A meditator should make every possible effort to acquire this _asamoha-sampajaññāṇa_. This is what is meant by

the above paragraph.

**Nature of _Tāvakālika_ (The Temporary Nature)**

At the _cakkhudvāra_ arise, starting with _pañcadvārāvajjana_ ending with _vuṭṭho_, the *citta*s. These *citta*s, in association with corresponding *cetasika sampaytta dhamma*s, perish away themoment they have perform their respective functions. They have so short a durations of existence that they did not realize each other. They are related to their _tāvakālika_ the duration of their functions = a momentary period. If all the occupants of a house died except one, then at that instant (= a condition of near death), dancing, singing by the remaining individual is not relevant. In same way, the related *citta*s like _āvajjana_ etc., which appears one after the other at the any one _dvāra_ (door), perishd away as soon as their corresponding functions have been accomplished. So also it is irrelevant to be attached, offended or delusioned towards the _ārammaṇa_ by _javana_-*citta*s at the remaining moment of the accomplished functions. Understand the _asamoha-sampajaññāṇa_ by realizing that there is a relationship between the functioning and time _tāvakālika_ =

temporary moment. (_Abhi_-_ṭha_-2: 341; _Ma-ṭha_-1: 267).

The _vīthi_-*citta*s within the corresponding *vīthi*s, such as _cakkhudvāravīthi_, toge-ther _sampayutta_-_cetasika_ *dhamma*s accomplish their respective functions and perish away in the short moments. This phenomenon should be discerned via _ñāṇa_. The _vīthi_-_nāma dhamma_ groups appearing at the six *dvāra*s (the six doors) should be concentrated and if the concentration could be promoted to vipassana meditation, then the _raga_, _dosa_, _moha_ would not have the chance to made their appearance. This means realization of the

truth without delusion, the _asammoha_-_sampajjañña_ could be acquired.

Also understand _asammoha_-_sampajjañña_ by virtue of _khandhā_, _āyatana_, _dhātu_, _paccaya_-_paccavakkhaṇa_.

**Attainment of _Asammoha_-_Sampajjañña_ by Virtue of Five-Fold _Khandhā_**

In looking straight ahead or sideways (during _cakkūu_-_viññāṇa citta-kkhanū_, a thought moment of visual consciousness)
ū

1. _Cakkhu_-_viññāṇa_ (visual cognition) and _rûpārammaṇa_ is the _rûpa_-_kkhandhā aggregate clinging to material qualities_).
1. _Cakkhu_-_viññāṇa_ which can discern the _rûpārammaṇa_ is the _viññāṇā-kkhandhā_.
1. _Vedanā_ associated* with *cakkhu*-*viññāṇa* is the *vedana*-*kkhandhā\*.
1. _Saññā_ associated with _cakkhu_-_viññāṇa_ is _saññā_-_kkhandhā_.
1. _Phassa-cetanā-ekaggatā-jīvita-manasikāra_ associated with the _cakkhu_-_viññāṇa_ is the _sañkhāra_-_kkhandhā_.

If these five-fold aggregates get united, the looking straight ahead or sideways arise distinctly. If so what person or the sentient being looks straight ahead and who looks sideways? (_Abhi_-_ṭha_-2: 342; _Ma-ṭha_-1: 267 – 268).

**\*Atthā**ti pacakkhandhavasena ālokana-vilokene paññāyamāne tabbinimutto **ekā eko āloketi\***, **_ko viloketi_** (_Dī_.- *ṭī.-*1: 250).

If looking straight ahead or sideways have arisen by virtue of combination of the five- fold _khandhā_, then who would look straight or sideways free from that five-fold _khandhā_? There is no such a person or sentient being lookin straight or sideways. There

only is the the five-fold _khandhā_.

The way the explanation are given in the above _Aṭṭhakathā_ are referred to as **_Uppalakkhaṇa method and Nidassa method_.**

The five-fold _khandhā_ are meditated during _cakkhu_-_viññāṇa citta-kkhana_. So ū

also each of the five-fold _khandhā_ are concentrated at every thought moment located in _manodvāra_-*vīthi*s, which take as the _ārammaṇa_ the _manodvāra_-_vīthi_ and _rûpārammaṇa_. If the five-fold _khandhā_ could be concentrated at every thought moment, then _asammoha sampajjañña-ñāṇa_ is acquired. The same applies to _sotadvāra_-_vīthi_ etc.

**Arising of _Asammoha Sampajjañña-ñāṇa_ by Way of _Ãyatana_**

In looking straight ahead or sideways (during a thought moment of visual cons-

ciousness)
ūū

1. The visual clearness element is termed _cakkhāyatana_ (the eye-base)
1. The _rûpārammaṇa_ is termed the _rûpāyatana_ (visible object base).
1. _Cakkhu_-_viññāṇa_ which can discern is termed the _manāyatana_ (mind base).
1. The seven modes of _sampayutta cetasika_ associated with _cakkhu_-_viññāṇa_, such as

 _vedanā_ etc., are termed _dhammāyatana_ (mental object base).

 If the four *āyatana*s become distinctly united, then the act of looking straight or sideways will appear clearly. If that is the case, what person or the sentient being looks straight ahead and who looks sideways? (_Abhi_-_ṭha_-2: 342; _Ma-ṭha_-1: 267 – 268).

If the looking straight or sideways clearly appear by virtue of the four modes of _āyatna_, then who would be looking straight and who sideways? In fact, what it means is that there none looking straight nor sideways, but only the four modes of _āyatana_. Here too understand that it is the _Uppalakkhaṇa method and Nidassa method_. At every _citta_-_kkhaṇa_, situated in _cakkhudvāra_-*vīth*i and _manodvāra-vīthi_, if each of the four _āyatana_ can taken as object of concentration, then the _sampajjañña-ñāṇa_ is acquired. The same applies to _sotadvāra_-_vīthi_ (the eye-door cognition process). In this way the 12 modes of

_āyatana_ (sense-bases) will be completely covered.

**Arising of _Asammoha Sampajjañña-ñāṇa_ by Way of 18 Dhātu\***

In looking straight ahead or sideways (during a thought moment of visual cons-

ciousness)
ūū

1. The visual clearness element is termed _cakkhu-dhātu_ (visual element).
1. _Rûpāyatana_ (visible object base) is termed the _rûpa_-_dhātu_ (visible element).
1. _Cakkhu_-_viññāṇa_ which can discern is termed the _cakkhu_-_viññāṇa_ _dhātu_ (seeing consciousness element).
1. The seven modes of _sampayutta cetasika_ associated with _cakkhu_-_viññāṇa_, such as

 _vedanā_ etc., are termed _dhamma dhātu_ (mental element).

 If the four *dhātu*s become distinctly united, then the act of looking straight or sideways will appear clearly. If that is the case, what person or the sentient being looks straight and who looks sideways? (_Abhi_-_ṭha_-2: 342; _Ma-ṭha_-1: 267 – 268).

If the looking straight or sideways clearly appear by virtue of the four *dhātu*s, then who would be looking straight and who sideways? In fact, what it means is that there none looking straight nor sideways, but only four the *dhātu*s. Here too understand that it is the _Uppalakkhaṇa method and Nidassa method_. At every _citta_-_kkhaṇa_, situated in _cakkhudvāra_- *vīth*i and _manodvāra-vīthi_, each of the four *dhātu*s must taken as object

of concentration.

In this way, if the each of the four *dhātu*s can be concentrated at every thought moment during the _cakkhudvāravīthi_-_manodvāravīthi_, then the _sampajjañña-ñāṇa_ is acquired. This is also true for _sotadvāra_-_vīthi_ etc. If concentration can be made in this

way, all the 18 modes of _dhātu_ would have been completed.

1. The visual clearness is the _pûrejātanissaya paccaya_ (a cause which renders support in the formation of _cakkhu_-_viññāṇa_ by competition between very early _atītabhavañga_ and visual clearness and among *uppāda*s before the _cakkhu_-_viññāṇa_ made its appearance).
1. The _rûpārammaṇa_ is the _ārammaṇa paccaya_ (the _rûpārammaṇa_ is the object of theū*cakkhu*-_viññāṇa citta_. On when there is discernible object could the _viññāṇa_, which can discern the object, be formed. There would be no _viññāṇa_ without discernible object. Therefore, for the appearance of _cakkhu_-_viññāṇa_ the _rûpārammaṇa_ presents itself as a cause and support in the form of object that is to discerned.)

 The _pañcadvāra_-_vajjana_ is the (a) _anantara_, (b) _samantara_, (c) _anantarûpanis-saya_, and (c) _vigata paccaya_. These are the causes.

(a) It ūs unusual for two *citta*s to arise simultaneously. ūOne arises after the formation and perishing away of the another. Therefore, only when _pañcadvāravajjana citta_ has ceased can the _cakkhu_-_viññāṇa citta_ arise. As long as the _pañcadvāravajjana citta_ is still there, the _cakkhu_-_viññāṇa citta_ cannot arise as yet. The _cakkhu_-_viññāṇa citta_ ceases only after supporting the arising of the _cakkhu_-_viññāṇa citta_. In between the supporting _pañca- dvāravajjana citta_ and the supported _cakkhu-viññā citta_ there exist no separating phenol- menon.

**_NÃMARÛPAVūVATTHÃNA_** DETERMINATION OF **_NÃMū_** AND **_RÛPA_**

**4. _Nāmarûpavavatthāna_ = Determination of _Rûpa_ + _ūāma_** ūūūūūūūū

_So evum phassādīnam vasena upatthite cattāro arûipno khandhe nāmanti, tesam aramman abhûtāni cattāri mahābhûtāni, catunnañca mahābhûtāni upādāyarûpam rûpanti vavatthapeti_. _Iti at t hārassa dhātuyo dvādasāyatanāni pañcakkhandhāti sabbepi tebhûmake dhamme khaggena samuggam vivaramāno viya yamakakālakandam phālaya-māno viya ca nāmañca rûpañcāti dvedhā vavatthapeti_. _Nāmarûpamattato uddam añño_

_satto vā puggalo vā devo vā byahmā vā nattīti ūittam gacchati_ (*Visuddhi-*2: 227 - 228).

When the meditator has clearly discerned the _rûpa_ phenomena in his conscious-ness, so would the _nāma_ phenomena be. In such a discernment of the _nāma_ factors, there are three ways:

3. The method of concentration starting with _phassa_ (contact),
4. The method of concentration starting with _vedanā_ (suffering), ūūūūū

\3. The method of concentration starting with consciousness _viññāṇa_ (perception). If the meditator concentrated on the *nāma dhamma*s via one of these three ways, then _vedanā-saññā-sañkhāra-viññāṇa_, referred to as the four-fold _nāmakhandhā_, are recog-nized as the ***nāmadhamma*s** which** will be acquired in his conscious mind. _Mahābhûta_ = the four great elements and all the *upādārûpa*s which take the four great elements as their object, are recognized as \***rûpa dhamma***s. In this way the 18 elements, 12-fold *āyatana*s, the five-fold *khandhā*s and all those factors in the three planes of existence = these innumerable *rûpa*- *nāma dhamma*s have been definitely and clearly defined. It comes to the realization that there are just the *nāma* and *rûpa* in the three planes of life, above which there exist no higher ***individuality-sentient being-life-self-human-devā-byahmā\*\*\*

(*Visuddhi-*2: 227 - 228). ūūū

According to the above instruction,ūwhen one is able to discern both _rûpa_+_nāma_ at every thought along the path of cittaniyāma, then these _rûpa_ + _nāma_ are taken as object of concentratūon to discern that in these there are **no** **“individuality-sentient being-life-self-human-_deva_-_byahmā_**, but **just the _rûpa_ + _nāma_**.

The determination is made of the _rûpa_+_nāma_ as explained above. (When one has acquired the ability to extend his consciousness to _bhahiddha_ and collectively meditate on the _bhahiddha rûpa_+_nāma_ in the 31 planes, then one would clearly realize the non-

existence of human-_devā_-_byahmā_).

**An Invaluable Resolution**

The Venerable Saūādaw Mathera, referred tū respectfully by the _desanā_ as **Ãcariyadhammapāla**, has made an invaūuable resolution in the domain of meditation in his Mahātīkā with respect to the above opening commentary. ūūūūūūūū

_Virājayam pajayam bhabbo dukkhakkhayāyā_”_ti._

(_Sam._-2:249 - 250 Parijānana Suttana; _Mahāṭī_-2: 358).

_Iti imassamim sutte tissopi pariññā kathitā hunti_. “_Abhijānan_”_ti hi vūcanena ñātapariññā kaūhitā_, “_parijānan_”_ti vacanena tīrūna pariññā_, “_virājayam pajahan_”_ti dvīhi pahānapariññāti_ (_Sam._- _ṭūha_-3ū 6). ū

The commentator in the above Visuddhimagga commentary has explained as: _Sabbepi tebhûmake dhamme nāmañca rûpañcāti dvedhā vavatthapeti =_ *tebhûmaka*s, within the three planes of life referred to as all of the _kāma-rûpa-arûpa_, are recognized as *rûpa dhamma*s as well as *nāma dhamma*s (mental factors, material factors) as two

distinct groups.\* ūū

 Here, the word _sabba_ = completeness = all is meant to include the entire *dhamma*s of the _sañkhāra_ phenomena. _Nāma_ and _rûpa_, however, are taken to be far apart from one another. (They are not the associated *sampayutta dhamma*s, but are dissociated *vippayutta dhamma*s). Therefore, the _nāma_ and *rûpa dhamma*s should not be analyzed

together as a composite group, but be recognized as two distinct groups, and are to be

taken as given below:
ū 3. The *dhamma*s that are of the nature of being attracted towards the object are _nāma_, 3. The *dhamma*s that are subject to change are the _rûpa_. ūūū

Only when so recognized can the non-existence of a certain ūdhamma* (such as the living being, soul, *viññān*.*a* , self) of the *tebhûmaka dhamma*s present in the three planes of life and being free from both *nāma* and *rûpa* — the entire *tebhûmaka dhamma\*s of the three

planes of life are recogniūed as two distinct _nāma_ andū*rûpa dhammas*. And this is what the commentator has streūsed in his explanation. ū

The expression “_Nāmañca rûpūñca_” = _nāmadhamma_ and _rûpadhamma_ is an adequate indication that the _nāma_ and _rûpa_ are two distinct words, yet they are further expressed as _dvedhā vavatthapeti_ = recognized as two distinct groups. It was expressed so to vindicate the non-existence of a certain _dhamma_ (such as the living being, soul, _viññāṇa_, self) of the *tebhûmaka dhamma*s present in the three planes of life and being

free from both _nāma_ and _rûpa._ ū

It was expounded in this way to arriūe at the determinatioū that there exist no individual--sentient being-life-self-human-_deva_-_brahmā_ beyond the _nāmarûpa_.

Again, it was expatiated as **_sabbepi tebhûmake dhamme_** = **_tebhûmakadhamma_** — in the word _sabba_ = all is used for purpose of concentration on the three general

characters _aniccū_-_dukkha_-_anatta_ = so as not to leave any of _sammasanupaggadhamma_. ū

Indeed, the _tebhûmakadhamma_ in the three planūs of existence is the _dhamma_ which should entirely be understood analytically; the attachment on to these _tebhûmaka_-*dhamma*s via craving should be eradicated through practice. By practicing to eradicate the craving on these, one should acquire freedom. That is the reason why the Buddha has admonished as follows:

“Bhikkhus .... if the craving for the entire _rûpanāma_ phenomena

7. are not understood penetratively by _ñātapariññā paññā_,
8. are not known analytically by _tīranpariññā_,
9. cannot practice to eradicate and be rūlieved of the attachment to them by craving, then one is not worthwhile to be relieved of the sorrows of the sansāric circus.

“Bhikkhus .... in fact, if the entire _rûpanāma_ phenomena

10. are understood penetratively by _ñātapariññā paññā_,
11. are known analytically by _tīranpariñā_,
12. has practiced to eradicate the attachment to them by craving, then one is worthwhile to be relieved of the sorrows of the sansāric circus (_Sam_.-2: 249 - .

 250).

This resolution has been made in Mahātīkā with reference that of Aparijānanasūttana of Samyuttapāli Salāyatanavaggasamyutta.

4. A statement that Nibbāna can be attained by meditating on just a single _rūpa_ element,
5. A statement that Nibbāna can be attained by meditating on just a single _nāma_ element, and
6. A statement that Nibbāna can be attained by meditating on just a single _rûpa_ element and just a single _nāma_ element.

These three statements are definitely the opposite of the resolution described in Mahātīkā. He who is in search of the right dhamma, however, should not turn his back on the resolution made in Mahātīkā. In fact he should obediently follow that resolution which has been made with reference the Buddha’s verbally delivered discourse. [The three kinds of *Pariññāpaññā* have been explained in Bhuddekarata.]

**_Dhātu_** = **element** - _attano sabhāvum dhāretīti dhātu_
ūū
It is named _dhātu_ because it possesses its own natural character (_Visuddhi_-2:116).

The _atta_ (self), which is the thought of wrong viewers and whose way of thinking is outside the _sāsanā_, when investigated by _paramattha_ eye of wisdom, does not clearly exist. Its non-existence becomes more clearly realized especially when the _rûpa_ and _nāma_ are investigated by way of the eye of wisdom after realization of their ultimate truth. Nothing other than _rûpa_ and _nāma_ is realized, nor is there the _atta_, as visualized by _ñāna_. _Atta_ is functionally _karaka_ (producer); _atta_ can appreciate _vedaka_ (feeling). In this way _atta_ has been designated to be _karaka_ and _vedaka_, but they are not to be. It cannot function nor feel. It is because the _atta_ itself, is claimed to have functioning or feeling property, is non-existent.

The ultimate truth, such as _cakkhu_ (eye) etc., are capable of performing and  
ūū
existing their own nature. For instance
ū
_Rûpābhighātārahabhûtappasādalakkhanam ,_
ūū
_Dalukāmatānidānakammasamutthānabhûtappasādalakkhanam vā cakkhu_ (*Visuddhi-*2: 74).

 Element of vision (= eye clear element), upon which impinges on the _bhûtarûpa_ (mental qualities of sense-fields) = possesses nature of giving clear vision on the Four Great

Elements. In other words, it has the nature of giving clear vision of the Four Great

Elements caused by _kamma_ arising from wishing to see the material object which are
ūūūūūūūūūūūū
based on _kāmatahnā_.

As indicated in Section on Rûpakammatthāna, _rûpa_ phenomena are made up of subatomic particles called _kalāpas_. The _kalāpa_ is the smallest particle of _rûpa_ factors in the sphere of _rûpaparamatta_. Element of vision too does not exist as individuality but according _rûpakalā_ called _cakkhudasakakalāpa_. Included in this _cakkhudasaka kalāpa_ are 10 _rûpa_ phenomena. These *rûpa dhamma*s are the _kamma_-produced corporeality which resulted from _kamma_ cultivated in the past based on causes _avijja-tahnā-upādāna_. The Four Mahābhûta Elements are also included in these 10 *rûpa*s of the _cakkhudasaka kalāpa_. These Mahābhûta Elements are the *dhamma*s on which impinges the _rûpa_ objects It is the natural character of element of vision which causes the clearness of the _mahābhûta_ factors; in every element of vision is present this natural character. Therefore, element of vision has its own nature, and performs in its own nature, and existed in the nature of its own. Note that it also applies to other elements. Since all these 18 *dhamma*s can exhibit the phenomena of the natural characters of their own, they are, therefore,

 nominated as “_dhātu_ = element.”

Among these 18 elements, the element of vision etc., are by now clearly explained A slight treatment on those still not clear will be made. First, mind element, _pañcaviññā_-

_dhātu_ (the five mind element) element of mental cognition will be described.

**_MANODHÃTU_ (ELEMENT OF APPRECIATION)** _Tīni manodhātucittāni ekā manodhātu_. (_Visuddhi_-2: 224).

_4. Pañcadvārāvajjan_; (2) _Ahitakusalavipākasampatcchan_; (3) _Ahitaakusala vipākasampatcchan_, the three kinds of mind are called the _manodhātu_ (element of appreciation).
ū
_Antādikā manodhātu_, _manoviññānadhātuyā_.

_Pavesāpagane dvāra-pariyāyene titthti_ (_Nāmarûpapariccheda_).\*

Among the three _citta_ named the _manodhātu_, the _bhavañga_ referred to as the _manoviññāna_ (mind cognition) get dissolved when _pañcadvārāvajjāna_ is attained and is thought to have entered into the state of _pañcadvārāvajjāna_. Therefore, _pañcadvārāvajjāna_ is the _dvāra_ (door) through which _bhvañgamanoviññāna_ enters. Again, the _manoviññāṇa_ called the _santīrana_ (investigation, decision) made its appearance following the _sampaticchana_ (acceptance). _Sampaticchana_, again, functions

as the outlet for _manoviññāṇa_. With reference to instructions of this nature, the three\* _manodhātu_ can be taken as the doors for the _manoviññāṇa_. In other words, it means it unusual appreciation.

It is explained in the earlier pages of the section on _Nāmakamma_._t_._t_ _hāna_ etc. that
ūū 4. Element of _bhavañgamano_ clearness is the _manodvāra_ (mind door), 4. _Bhavañgamano_ together with _āvajjana_ (adverting mind) is the _manodvāra_, 4. From point of view of _T t hānûpacāra_ (by way of place) or _phalûpacāra_ (by way of contact, the _hadayavatthu_ (heart-based corporeality) is called the _manodvāra_ too. (see pages etc.). Taking of _bhavañga_ as the _manodvāra_, and of _bhavañga_  
\*
 together with _āvajjana_ as _manodvāra_ is the usual way of appreciation.

In _pañcadvārāvajjana_ (five door contemplation) and _sampaticchānadve_ named as _manodvāra_ (mind door), _pañcadvārāvajjana_, when taken as object, is not effective as taking object of concentration following others nor as repetitively taken object of concentration, because the newly formed object in earlier stage of concentration has been taken only once. That is why the _manodvāravajjana_ and _sampaticchanadve_ are — _mano evadhātu manodhātu_— referred to as the _manodhātu_ because it is an element which

could bring about just the consciousness.

_PAÑCAVIÑÑāNADHāTU_

The *panñviññāna*s have to simply capture the object which directly appear on the receptive corporeality. Therefore, the force of concentration is more than that of the _manodhātu_, and that is the reason why it is nominated as the _viññānadhātu_. It is also named *visesanajātīti viññānam\*\* = takes the object more forcefully than the *manodhātu*. Because it is supported by *anan tara* force from the *āvajjana* (adverting mind), having different objects, and has to support the *sampaticchana\* having different object, it used to

be less forceful than the _manoviññāna_ supporting the _viññāna_ of similar objects. As instructed in Vibhañga Pāli referred to as Aññatara Abhinipātamatta it is just that falling upon the respective object of the five-fold object.

[***Anantara**—***Someone becomes successful at the expense of someone else**. As this statement goes, two *citta*s (consciousnesses) cannot come about simultaneously, but one after another. (The earlier consciousnesses disappear after facilitating the appearance of the later). The early *citta*s arose and, after facilitating the rising of the later, perish away. Before dissolution of the former, the later *citta*s have no chance to arise. Remember that an old president would relieve himself only after handing over his duties to the new one. The support of the former *citta* for the appearance of the next one is called *anantarapaccaya*.]

THE _MANOVIÑÑāDHÃTU_

Literally _mano_ (mind) refers to “knowledge”, and so also the _manoviññāna_ (mental consciousness) to “special knowledge.” The combination of the two explicitly gives the essence of a “wide knowledge, a very high knowledge and very high and wide knowledge.” The way the realization is acquired by the very high and wide knowledge is

this. Unlike the *citta*s described above, it does not take the new object at very early state (even though the capture has to be made in a way similar to _manodvāravajjana_), supported by anantara force of the citta having similar object, supports the later citta of the same material object by force of _anantara_ support. Hence the capture on the object is very effective. Therefore, it is a nominated, from _manoviññānadhātu_ point of view, as

_mano_ with _viññānam_ (see Compendium of Buddhist Philosophy, p.182).

NOMINATION AS _ÃYATANA_

_Visesato pana āyatanato, āyānam tananato, āyatassa ca **nayanato** **āyatanam**ti Veditabbam_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 112).

It is so named

1. Because of the functions performed by each and every _citta cetasika_ (mind and mental concomitants) on their own. ūū
1. Because of the capability of _āya_ (lengtheniūg) the stretched mind and mental concomitants due to exerting effort by each and every one of them.
1. Because of bearing full suffering of the rounds of rebirth along the _sansāric_ circus.
1. **_Ãyatana_**. It means _āya_ (cause) according to the meaning of the terms. If there is no eye sensitivity and visible object, there can be no _cakkhudvārikavīthicitta_ (mind door thought process). If there are no _cakkhudvārikavīthicitta_, each and every mind and men-tal concomitant, appearing every _cittakhana_ (thought moment) within, these cannot per-form their respective functions. Thus, the _cakkhupasāda_ and _rûpārammana_ are the causes for _cakkhudvāravīthicitta_ and of carrying out the respective functions by the _cakkhudvārika nāma dhammas_ (mental phenomena arising through the eye door). This is the reason why the name _cakkhāyatana_ — _rûpāyatana_ is given. Note that the same applies to the remaining _āyatana_ pairs.
1. Only when there are _cakkhudvāra_ (eye door) and _rûpāyamana_ (physical object), can there be *nāma dhamma*s (mental factors). Without these there be no _cakkhu_-*dvāra nāma dhamma*s. Note that it is also true for _sotadvāra saddārammana_ etc. Each mind and mental concomitant appearing with reference to the corresponding _dvāras_ (doors) are stretched by the *āyatana*s. Like a photographic enlarger which enlarges the small photographs, the *āyatana*s enlarge the mind and mental conco-mitants. If any one (_ayonisomarikāra_ = one having unwise attention) comes across a pleasant sound and agreeable beauty, he would exaggerate on what he has just encountered. But he comes across a disagreeable sound or a feature, he would exaggerate on what he has seen with a wry face. He would be smiling within himself and reflecting in his mind of minds. He would be reminiscing on it. This a kind of enlarging the mind mental concomitant. In the life-continuum of a good man of a _yonisomanasikāra_ (= one having wise attention) the *akusala dham-ma*s (unmeritorious deeds) do not get enlarged on the basis of these *dvārā-rammana*s. The mind and mental concomitants associated with the insight know-ledge, such as _aniccanupassanāñana_, _dukkhanupassanāñana_, _anattaanupassanā-ñana_ etc., however become enlarged. Such a kind of enlargement leads one to the nibbāna, and is worth culturing.
1. In the infinite rounds of rebirth (_sansāra_), with no beginning, the long suffering of _sansāravatta_ (sansāric function) has not yet ceased with non-reappearing cessation, the _anupādanirodha_. As long as they remain, these *āyatana*s would be bearing the full-fledged suffering of the sansāric circus. And hence, they are

 referred to as the *āyatana*s (Visuddhi. 2:112).

This being so, since all the *paramattha dhamma*s bear their own specific characters (= the characters), they should be taken as a single “_dhammā-yatana_.” A question would then arise as to why it is expatiated as 12 *āyatana*s but treating each separately. The answer follows.

This _āyatana desana_ is exhorted to clearly differentiate the doors and object of the six kinds of _viññānakāya_ (tactile cognition). Since there are six *dvāra*s and six _āram-_
ū
_mana_ _āyatanas_, it was expounded as 12 *āyatana*s instead of a single _dhammāyatana_.

7. The door, at which all the _viññāna_ (cognition) included in the _cakkhuviññānavīthi_ (eye consciousness process), is just the _cakkhāyatana_, and the _rûpārammana_ (visible object) is the only object domain.
8. The door, at which all the _viññāna_ (cognition) included in the _sotaviññānavīthi_ (ear consciousness process), is just the _sotāyatana_, and _saddārammana_ (acoustic object) is the only object domain.
9. The door, at which all the _viññāna_ (cognition) included in the _ghānaviññānavīthi_ (nose consciousness process), is just the _gandhārammana_ (olfactory object) is the only object domain.
10. The door, at which all the _viññāna_ (cognition) included in the _jivhāviññānavīthi_ (tongue consciousness process), is just the _rasārammana_ (taste object) is the only object domain.
11. The door, at which all the _viññāna_ (cognition) included in the _kāyaviññānavīthi_ (body consciousness process), is just the _phothabbārammana_ (tactile object) is the

 only object domain.

12. The door is the plane where all the *viññāna*s* (cognition), which are included in the *manoviññānavīthi*, arise and part of the *āyatana* referred to as *bhavañgacitta\*

 arising after being vibrated twice.

(This is a translation with reference to Mahātīkā. According to speeches made by successive generations of teachers, the plane of formation of all the _viññānas_, included in the _manoviññānavīthi_, is just a part of the _āyatana_ referred to as _bhavañgacitta_ arising after vibrating twice. According to the Subcommentary (Tīkā), the _bhavañgaclana_ (vibration of life-continuum), which arises after vibrating twice, is the _manodvāra_. Generations of teachers have said that the vibrating _bhavañga_ = vibration of life-continuum = arising completely later = _bhavañgupaccheda_ (cessation of life-continuum) The only difference is the usage of _bhavañgacalana_ and _bhavañgupaccheda_. In essence, however, note that the main _desanā_ is the same. The vibrating _bhavañga_ = _bhavañga_-_calana_ by the power of which the _bhavañga_ distinctly arises, and _āvajjana_ can only arise when _bhavañga_ arises. _Ãvajjana_ will not arise when the _bhavañgacalana_ does not arise. With _bhavañga_ as the cause of _āvajjana_ in mind, the commentator has explained that _bhavañgacalana_ (= _bhavñgupaccheda_) referred to as _bhavañgamana_, which is a part of _āyatana_, is the plane of _dvāra_ where all the _viññāna_ included in the _manoviññānavīthi_ are  
ū
formed.)

**\*Ekadesayûpaca** - Lokiyasattaviññānadhātu manāyatanam* (*Visuddhi* 2: 224).
ū
It has been explained that all the seven *lokiviññādhātu*, i.e., all the *lokīcitta* (the object of insight knowledge) are *manāyatana*. Note that *bhavañga\* _citta_, which is a part of _manāyatana_, is taken by way of _ekadesayñpacāya_ as _manāyatana_, and again this _bhavañgamanāyatana_ as the _manodvāra_ the support of all _manoviññāna_.
ūū
**\*Dhammāyatana —** Tasampayuttā phassādayo sesarûpañca* “*dhammāyatanan*”*ti* (*Visud*- *dhi\* 2: 224).

All *āyatana*s, except the _lokīviññānadhātu_ and _phassa_ etc. of 25 mind and mental concomitants occurring in each _cittakhana_ and _cakkhāyatana_ etc. of the above 10 _rûpā_- _yatana_, the remaining 16 *sukhumarûpa*s are the *dhammāyatana*s. These *dhammāyatana*s

are not associated either as _dvāra_ or object with _cakkhuviññāna_ etc. of the _pañcaviññāna_.

Another way of taking _Manodvāra_. “_Ayam nāma mano manādvāram na hotī_”_ti (Abhi. Tha._ 1: 129).

According to this commentary, the early _mana_ (= mind) is beneficial to the later _mana_ (mind). Therefore, all the early _mana_ can be taken as the causative _dvāra_ of the later ones. With reference to this commentary all the _citta_ called _manāyatana_ are _mano_-_dvāra_. Taking only the _bhavañga_ as the _manodvāra_ is routine way. Note that all the _citta_ as _manodvāra_ is by way of _pariyāya_. (A kind of _pariyāya_ refers to the _anantara_, the  
ūūūūūūū
proximate cause).
ū
**_Dhammāyatana also is a pariyāya_**. _Rûpāyatana_ etc. are usually (customarily) referred to as _rûpāyatana_. _Dhammāyatana_ and _dhammāramana_, however, are slightly different. As mentioned under _Dhammāyatana_ (see earlier pages of this vol.), _pasāda-rûpa_ (clear sensitivity), _sukhumarûpa_ (subtle forms), mind, mental concomitant, nibbāna and _paññatti_ (concept) are included in the phenomena called _dhammārammana_. Exhorta- tion has been made to selectively include the object of insight knowledge in the _dhammā_-_yatana_. But nibbāna and _paññatti_ cannot be included. The five clear sensitivity, which have been specially designated as _cakkhāyatana_ etc., cannot be included in the _dhammā_-_yatana._ Because all the *lokicitta*s have been given a special name _manāyatana_, they are not included in the _dhammāyatana_. Therefore, it must be noted that designating _dham_-_māyatana_ as _dhammārammana_ — the six _dvārayatana_, the six _ārammanāyatana_ — differentiating 12 *āyatana*s is because of a kind of _pariyāya_ (conditioned cause). (The _āyatana desanā_ was expounded for _rûpasammûlā_ and _majjimarûci_ individuals. See  
ū
section on _Rûpakammatthāna_).

[**Special Note**. Among the 16 subtle forms named _dhammāyata_ is also included the very important _hadayavatthurûpa_ (heart-based corporeality, which also is the _dham_- _māyatana_. This is a factor very important in concentrating on the 12 _āyatana_ objects and

the 18 element objects.]

Again, the six doors, the six objects and the six concepts, developed dependent upon the six objects of concentration, together come to 18 in all — the six each of the doors, the objects and the concepts. It should be noted that, as described in  
ū
_dhammāyatana_, the _dhammadhātu_ is called _dhammārammana_.

CULTURING _RÛPA_ — _NāMA_ BY WAY OF 18 ELEMENTS

In seūtion on _Rûpakammatthāna_, the _cakkhudvārū_ = 54 kinds of visual sense (the eye), the true *rûpa*s have been described in tables. Among these 54
ū

1.  1. Clear sensitivity is the visual element, but the remaining 53 are not.

5) _Rûpārammana_ (visible object base) is the _rûpa_ element.
6) Depending on the _cakkhudhātu_, and taking the _rûpadhātu_ as the object, there

arises the mind which is the _cakkhuvññānadhātu_.

2.  1. _Sotapasāda_ (clear sensitivity of ear) is the _sotadhātu_ (sound element), but the remaining 53 are not.

2) _Saddārammana_ is the _saddādhātu_
3) The _citta_ (mind) which arises depending on and taking _saddahātu_ as the object, is the _sotaviññānadhātu_.

3.  1. _Ghānāpasāda_ (nose clear sensitivity) is the _gānadhātu_ (the scent element), but the remaining 53 are not.

2) _Gandārammana_ is the _gandadhātu_.
3) The _citta_ (mind) which arises depending on _ghānadhātu_ and taking the _gandārammana_ as the object, is the _ghānaviññānadhātu_.

4.  1. _Jivhāpasāda_ (tongue clear sensitivity) is the _jivādhātu_ (the scent element), but the remaining 53 are not.

2) _Rasārammana_ (_taste object)_ is the _rasadhātu_.
3) The _citta_ (mind) which arises depending on _jivhādhātu_ and taking _jivhārammana_ as the object, is the _jivhāviññānadhātu_.

5.  1. _Kāyapasāda_ (clear sensitivity of body) is the _kāyadhātu_ (the body element), but the remaining 53 are not.

2) _Pholabbārammana_ (_tactile object)_ is the _pholabbadhāūu_ (tangible element).
3) The _citta_ (mind) which arises depending on _kāyadhātu_ and taking _pholabba_ as the object, is the _kāyaviññānadhātu._

6.  1. _Pañcadvāvajjana_ - _sampatichannadve_ is the _manodhātu_.

2) The 52 _cetasika_ (mental concomitants) and 16 _sukhumarûpa_ (subtle material forms) are the _dhammadhātu_.
3) The _citta_ (mind) which arises depending _manodhātu_ and taking _dhammadhātu_ as

 the object, is the _manoviññānadhātu_.

[Note. As a good man the _manoviññānadhātu_, which can acquired at a _tihita_ (3-rooted condition) worldling stage, in your life-continuum are of the following kinds:

1. _Akusalacitta_ (karmically unwholesome consciousness) 12
1. _Santīranacitta_ (investigating consciousness) 3
1. _Mūnodvāravajjana_ (advertence) 1
1. _Mahākusalacitta_ (great, wholesome consciousness) 8
1. _Mahāvipākacūtta_ (result of great deed) 8
1. _Rûpāvacarajana_ (_kusala_) (fine material sphere consciousness) 4 (_catukka_ method) They all come to a total of 36 kinds.

If raised to _rûpāvacara_ (world of forms) by way of _pañcaka_ (five-fold), there will be 37 kinds of _viññānadhatu_ (consciousness element). If all the eight _samāpatti_ (sus-

tained deep mental absorption) have been acquired, there will be 40 or 41 _viññānadhātu_.]
ū
In this way the various _dhātu_ (elements) are discerned to attain the visual knowledge of their ultimate truth:

7. _Cakkhudhātu, rûpadhātu, cakkhuviññānadhātu ,_
8. _Sotadhātu, saddadhātu, sotaviññānadhātu,_
9. _Ghānadhātu, gandhadhātu, ghānaviññānadhātu ,_
10. _Jivhādhātu, rasadhātu, jivhāviññānadhātu,_
11. _Kāyadhātu,ūpholabbadhātu, kāyaviññānadhātu,_
12. _Manodhātu, dhammadhātu, manoviññānadhātu_. (Note that it is not citation _kammatthāna_).

 material forms are the _dhammāyatana_.

The _cakkhāyatana-rñpāyatana,_ the _sotāyatana-saddāyatana,_ the _ghānāyatana- gandhāyatana,_ the _jivhāyatana-rasāyatana,_ the _kāyāyatana-pholabbāyatana,_ the _dhammāyatana_, called the\* 16 subtle material forms, are all **_rûpadhamma_**.

The _manāyatana_ and _dhammāyatan_ (called the 52 _cetasika_) are all **_nāmadham-_**
ūū
**_ma_**.
ū
In this way concentrate on the _rûpa-nāma_ and discern the _rûpa-nāma_ (_Visuddhi_ 2: 224 - 225).

Here too it is important that the _kammatthāna_ is not a citation. One has to understand that the instruction is made to concentrate on these *āyatana*s as object to attain the ultimate truth via perfect knowledge (insight knowledge). The method is to combine the 18 *dhātu*s and the 12 *āyatana*s and to discern on the sum total of these. The discernment analytically of these into finer details is given in Mûlapannasa Commentary as follows. They are the ways of discerning the four *āyatana*s and the four *dhātu*s that arise at every _vīthicittakhana_ (mental process moment) along the course of _cittaniyāma_ (mental certainty).
ūūūū
**A WAY OF DISCERNING _DHāTU_ — _āYATANA_**

_Tatthā cakkhu cakkhāyatanam, rûpam rûpāyatanam, dassanam manāyatana vedanādayo sampayuttadhammā dhammāyatanam. Evametesam catunnam āyatanānam samavāye ālokanavilokanam paññāyati. Tattha ko eko āloketi, ko viloketi. Tathā cakkhu cakkhu-dhātu, rûpam rûpadhātu, dassanam cakkhuviññānadhātu, tamsampayuttā vedanādayo dhammadhātu. Evametāsam cakkhunnam dhātunam samavāye ālokanavikkanam_

_paññāyati. Tatthako eko āloketi, ko viloketi_ (_Ma-Ttha._ 1: 268).

If the following four *āyatana*s happen to come together there occurs the state of looking straight and looking askance.

5. Eye clear element is the eye base\*
6. Visible object is the visible object base
7. Visualizing visual concept is the mind base
8. The associated mind and mental concomitant _sampayutta dhamma_ groups, such as _phassa-vedanā-saññā-cetanā-ekaggatā-jīvita-manasikāra_, are the _dhammā-yatana_ (mental object base).

Now who would see this way? Which living being would look straight forward or askance? (It means there is neither straight forward looking nor looking askance ones).

A simūlarly situation holds true for the following. ū

5. _Cakkhupasāda_ (the eye sensitivity) is the _cakkhudhātu_ (the element of vision)
6. _Rûpārammana_ (the visible object base)* is the *rûpadhātu* (the mental element)*.\*
7. Realizing _cakkhuviññāna_ (the eye consciousness) is the _cakkhuviññānadhātu_ (the eye consciousness element).
8. The associated mental concomitants, such as _phassa_ etc., the _phassasampayutta_- _dhamma_ (associated tangible factors) are _dhammadhātu_ (mind element).

(_Ma.Ttha_.1: 261).
ū
The opening of these documentaries explained in such a way that the manifestations become vividly materialized using the _upalakkhanā_ and _nidassana_ methods.

Now you good man, discern the _nāmakammatthāna_ tables again. Pay attention to them as the object of concentration. Pay attention on the corporeality and mentality once again. In the above commentary it is explained that the four *āyatana*s and the four *dhātu*s are realized as the _rûpārammana_ at the instance of the _cittaviññāna_ (mental consciousness) _cittakkhana_ (thought moment).

The mental consciousness cannot arise without _pañcadvāravajjana_ (apprehension through the five sense doors) arising before it. If it is the _cakkhuviññāna_ (eye consciousness), a series of thought processes do not halt during the interval of _cakkhuviññāna_, or of _sampaticchana_, nor _santīrana_. It will continue at least up to _vuttho_ (determining consciousness). Even then, the _ārammana_ has to be weak _parittārammana_ for it to halt the mental processes and come to a _bhavañga_ (rapt.). If the _ārammana_ (the object) is the _mahantarāramma_, it is usual to continue up to the attainment of _jo_ (impulsion), if _atirām mana_ up to _tadārammana_ (registering).

Therefore at a consciousness moment of _cakkhuviññāna_, the four *āyatana*s and the four *dhātu*s are formed, so also at the _pañcadvāravajjana, sampticchana, santīrana_, _uttho, tadārammana_ etc., there are four *āyatana*s and four *dhātu*s respectively. A few examples will be cited here. At each thought moment, there will be four *āyatana*s and

four ūdhātu\*s respectively, where — ū

5. Supporting heart-based corporeality is the _dhammāyatana_ (mental object).
6. _Rûpārammana_ (visible object) is the _rûpāyatana_ (visible object base).
7. _Pañcadvārāvajjana citta_ (conscious mind through the five sense doors) is the _manāyatana_ (mind-based sense).
8. The associated mental concomitant _sampayutta_ (association) groups are _dhammā_- _yatana_ (mental base).
9. The supporting heart-based corporeality is the _dhammadhātu._
10. The visible object is the _dhammadhātu_.
11. The _pañcadvārāvajjana citta_ is the _manodhāma_.
12. The associated mental concomitant _sampayutta_ groups are _dhammadhātu_.

 However, the heart-based corporeality and associated mental concomitant _dhamma_ groups are both the _dhammadhātu_. If such similar *dhamma*s are combined, there will be three *āyatana*s and three *dhātu*s. Note that this hold true for the remaining thought processes (_vīthicitta_). Whether small or large in numbers, all the associated mental

concomitant *sampayutta dhamma*s are the _dhammāyatana_ and _dhammadhātu_ only.

There still remain some distinct cases. For example, though _sampaticchana_ is named _manāyatana_ (the mental object base), but as an element it is _manodhātu_ (the mental element). It is not nominated as _manoviññānadhātu_. Note that the remaining thought processes are _manoāyatana_ as well as _manoviññānadhātu_. For those still with immature knowledge the _jocittakhana_ (moment of consciousness impulsion) , which includes _nāmadhamma_, is given as an illustration.

In each and every _jocittakhanā_ (character of consciousness impulsion), under-

stand theūfour _āyatana_ ū

5. The supporting heart-base corporeality is the _dhammāyatana_ (= _dhammadhātu_).
6. The _rûpārammana_ is the _rûpāyatana_.
7. The _kusalajoviññāna_ (meritorious consciousness impulsion) is the _manāyatana_ (= _manoviññānadhātu_).
8. The associated mental concomitant, the (33) association _dhamma_ groups are the

 _dhammāyatana_ (= _dhammadhātu_).

In other words, if the heart-base corporeality and mental concomitant _dhamma_ are combined as they have similar ātatana, there will be three *āyatana*s and three *dhātu*s. In this way concentrate on the four *āyatana*s and the four *dhātu*s at every thought process moment. Discern on all the good and bad groups in accordance with process series. Contemplate covering all the six lines. Concentrate on row after row given in the _Ñāmakammattha_ tables. When one is able to also discern _patisandhe-bhavañga-cuti_,  
ū
continue in a similar way as above.

If one wants to discern another way, after successfully concentrating on the four *āyatan*s and the four *dhatu*s at every thought moment as mentioned above, one may culture the whole row through and through. Lest use see the first row (good group table) of line showing the _rûpārammana_ of the good group table. Here, there are _pañcadvārāvajjana, cakkhuviññāna, sampticchana, santīrana, vuttho_, seven impulsions, two _tadārammana_ — _manodvārāvajjana_, seven impulsions, two _tadārāmmana_

respectivelū. The at every thought process momenū, discern aū given below.

5. The supporting heart base corporeality as object concentrate as _dhammāyatana_, _cakkhāyatana, dhammāyatana, dhammāyatana_ .....
6. Taking rûpārammana as object concentrate as _rûpāyatana, rûpāyatana,_ .....
7. Taking each consciousne mind as object collect as _manāyatana_, _manāyatana_.
8. Taking the associated mental concomitant _sampayutta dhamma_ groups as object,

 concentrate as _dhammāyatana_, _dhammāyatana_.
ū
In this way collect each row four times.

In supporting corporeality, all the _cakkhuviññāna dhamma_ groups are upon _cak_- _khuvutthurûpa_ (visual corporeality). All the remaining thought processes arise dependent upon the heart base corporeality called the _dhammāyatana_ and _dhamma-dhātu_. So note that in the supporting corporeality, the *dhammāyatana*s are for the remaining thought processes, and the _cakkāyatana_ is for the _cakkhuviññāna_. In con-

tinuation, a hintūon collection by the 18 _dhātu_ way will be descrūbed. ū

5. Taking the supporting corporeality as the only object discern as _dhammadhātu, dhammadhātu, dhammadhātu, dhammadhātu_ ....
6. The _ārāmmanarûpa_ only is taken as the object and discern as _rûpadhātu, rûpa-dhāru_ ....
7. Taking each conscious mind as the object discern as _manodhātu, cakkhuviññāna- dhātu, manodhātu, manoviññānadhātu_.
8. The associated mental concomitant _sampayutta dhamma_ groups are taken as the

 object and discerned as _dhammadhātu, dhammadhātu_ .....

The above 1 - 4 belong to the eye door thought process and mind door thought

process.

The _pañcadvārāvajjana_ and _samptaticchana_ are the _manodhātu, cakkhuviññāna_ is the _cakkhuviññāna dhātu_, and the remaining thought processes are the _cakkhuviññāna dhātu_. In contemplating on the _cetasika_, each is taken with reference to its associated _cetasika_ arising at each thought moment, and collectively taken as the _dhammāyatana_ or  
ū
the _dhammadhātu_.

Collect all the bad and good groups in each row in the line showing _rûpārammana_. Discern in the _saddārammana_, etc. in a similar way. In this method the discernment on  
ūū
both _āyatana_ and _dhātu_ phenomena are the same.

Reside singly in _arañña_ (in the forest), _rukkhāmûla_ (under a tree), _suññāgāra_ (in a quiet place) happily, as the Lord has instructed. With the mind set at the nibbāna with _appamādadhamma_ (mindfulness) called the vigilance on the object _rûpanāmadhamma sañkhāra_, a vigorous concentration is to be made with unyielding zest and zeal.

Now collection of the five-fold corporeality will be described. To begin with, _khandhā_ (corporeality) and _upādānakkhandhā_ (the five clinging aggregate) will be presented. **EXTRACTS FROM KHANDHā-SUTTANA**

All these (11) categories of material forms are the _rûpakkhandhā_ (the aggregate of the matter or of corporeality).
8. R. All the _vedanā dhamma_ (phenomena of suffering) are the _vedanakkhandhā_ (aggregate of sensation or feeling group).
9. R. All the _saññā dhamma_ (phenomena of perception) are the _saññakkhandhā_ (the aggregate of mental formation or perception group).
10. R. all the _cetasika sankhāra dhamma_ (mental formation phenomena) are _sankhā- ranakkhandhā_ (aggregate of mental formation).
11. All the _viññāna dhamma_ (consciousness factor) of the past, future and present, all those that are internal and external, all those that are coarse and subtle, all those that are low and lofty, all those that are far and near. All these (11) categories of

 are the _viññāna dhamma_. are _viññānakkhandhā_ (the aggregate of consciousness).

Bhikkhus .... These are the five-fold *khandhā*s

(_Sam_. 2: 39; _Khandhāsuttana_).
ū
Bhikkhus .... What are the five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_? There are such *dhamma*s as
ū 12. 1. All the _rûpa_ phenomena of the past, future and the present, to which are attached as “I, mine” by _tahnā, ditthi_ and which are the object of the four _āsava dhamma_ (moral intoxicants), all those that are internal and external, all those that are coarse and subtle, all those that are low and lofty, all those that are far (from consciousness) and near (to consciousness). All these physical phenomena are

 the _rûpupādānakkhandhā_ (the aggregate as the object of grasping), existing as (11)

categories, and attached as “I, mine” by means of _tahnā, ditthi,_ the object of

 the four immoral intoxicants.

6. R. All the _vedanā dhamma_ are the _vedanupādānakkhandhā_ (clinging to the aggregate of sensation).
7. R. All the _saññā dhamma_ are the _saññupādānakkhandhā_ (clinging to the aggregate of perception).
8. R. All the _cetasika sañkhāra_ dhammas are the _sankārupādānakkhandhā_ (clinging to the aggregate of formation).
9. R. All the _viññāna dhamma_ (concept phenomena) are the _viññānupādānakkhandhā_

 (clinging to the aggregate of sensation) (_Sam_.-2:39, _Khandha-suttana_)

**_KHANDHā_ AND _UPāDāNAKKHANDHā_**

**(THE AGGREGATES AND THE AGGREGATES AS OBJECT OF**  
ūūūūū
**CLINGING)**
ū
_Chatthe rûpakkhandho kāmāvacaro, cattāro khandhā catubhûmakā._ R. _Idhāpi rûpak- khandho kāmāvacaro, avasesā tebhûmakā vipassanācāravasena vuttā. Evmettha rûpam rāsatthena khandhesu pavittham, sasavrāsatthena upādānakkhandhesu_. _Vedanādayo_

3. In the five-fold _khandhā_, _rûpakkhandhā_ is the _kāmāvacara_ (the realms of sensual pleasures). The _vedanā-saññā-sankhāra-viññāna_, called the four-fold _nāmakkhandhā_ (the mental aggregate) are the _kāma-rûpa-arûpa-lokuttarā_ (the sensual existence-deva corporeal-formless existence), the *dhamma*s of the four _bhavana_ (planes) of existence. The first _Khandhādesanā_ was expounded to show that, whether in the mundane or supra-mundane, all the *dhamma*s that can be taken collectively as aggregates
4. In the _upādānakkhandhā,_ expounded as the second _desanā_, corporeal aggregate is the _kāmāvacara dhamma_. _Vedanā-saññā-sankāra-viññāna_, the four _nāmak-khandhā_, are those *tebhûmaka dhamma*s formed in the three planes of existence as _kāma-rûpa- arûpa_. The Buddha has to again expatiate the _upādānakkhandhā_ (the clinging aggregate) as the object of _vipassanañāna_ (insight knowledge)

 referred to as the _vipassanacāra_ (vipassanā exercise).

For a meditator still at the three-root plane of mundane mind and mental concomitant, called the _lokuttarakhandhā_ are the _dhamma_ he has not acquired yet. Therefore the _vipassanābhāvanā kammatthāna_, taking the lokuttarakhandhāas the object, cannot be made by analytical knowledge. But those who have acquired the _lokuttara_ _dhamma_ can. The _lokuttara_ mind and mental concomitant, however, the _sañkhata_

(results produced by specific action) _dhamma_ too. With reference to —

_Tīnimāni bhikhave sañkhatassa sañkhatalakkhanāni. Katamā tīni, uppādo paññāyatti, vayopañāyati, tthitassa aññatthattam paññāyati_ (_Am._ 1: 150).

the _sañkhata suttana desanā_, formation-static-dissolution = _upādā-tthī-bhañga_, there are definitely three _sañkhata_ (results produced by specific action) characters. Because of these three, they are also the _sañkhata_ *dhamma*s. They are the *dhamma*s dependent upon the phenomena of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of the _sañkhata_ _dhamma_ — arising only when supported by the forceful object of _upanissaya_ property of insight knowledge called _dhammaditthi_. Also when supported by the force of _ārammana paccaya_ (the object condition) of _asañkhata dhātu_ (the unconditioned and absolute element) only can these *dhamma*s arise. They are the *sañkhāra dhamma*s too. Therefore, it is true that they are  
ū
the _anicca, dukkha_ and *anatta dhamma*s.

Although these _lokuttarā citta-cetasika_ (the supra-mundane mind and mental concomitants) are the _sañkata_ and *sañkhāra dhamma*s included in the _anicca-dukkha-anatta dhamma_ groups, the *magga dhamma*s (the Path factors) are those that relieve one from the suffering of the rounds of rebirth = the good _niyānika_ (leading to salvation) *dhamma*s. The _phala_ (Fruit) *dhamma*s are also the good causes definitely leading to enjoyment of the _santisukha_ of the _nibbāna_ = the great peacefulness. Therefore the discernment on these _lokuttarā citta_ and _cetasika_ by _vipassanā_ as _anicca-dukkha-anatta_ are not meant to become wearied of worldly life by _nibbinda ñāna_ (knowledge of tedium) But when the vipassanā exercise is made taking as object only on the _lokī citta-cetasika_-_rûpa_, recognized as the causes for suffering of the *sansār*ic circus, then the nature of _citta-cetasika_ will vividly be understood. Then the _nibbinda ñāna_, which become entirely tedious of the five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_, referred to as the suffering of the *sansār*ic circus, will arise. That is why only the *lokī khandhā*s (mundane aggrgate) taken as object in exercising _vipassanākammatthāna_. With a view to contemplate in this way,  
ū
the Buddha has to admonish _upādānakkhandhā desanā_ solely of the *lokī khandhā*s.

Since the _rûpa dhamma_ means aggregate, it is also included in the *khandhā*s. It also bears the meaning of aggregate as the object of _āsava_ (canker, fetter) *dhamma*s,

hence it is included in the *upādānakkhandhā*s too.

The four-fold *nāma khandhā*s, such as _vedanā_ (feeling) etc., are the *khandhā*s that are the object of the *āsava dhamma*s. There are those *khandhā*s which are not the object of the *āsava dhamma*s. The _lokī citta-cetasika_ included in this four-fold *khandhā*s are  
ūū
the object of *āsava dhamma*s, but _lokuttarā citta-cetasika_ are not.
ū
Included in the three planes of life, _kāma-rûpa-arûpa_, are the _lokī citta-cetasika- vedanā-saññā-sañkhāra-viññāna_. These are included in _upādānakkhandhā_ because it bears the meaning of being the object of _āsava dhammas_.
ūū
The of the _lokī citta-cetasika-rûpa_ included in the three planes of life —
ū 5. The 28 species of _rûpa_ are _rûpupādānakkhandhā_. 5. _Vedanācetasika_ is the _vedanupādānakkhandhā_. 5. _Saññācetasika_ is the _saññûpānakkhandhā_. ūū 5. The remaining (50) *cetasika*s are all _vedanupādhānakkhandhā_.
ū
[N.B. To make it easier, the five-fold upādānakkhandhā are sometimes expressed as the *rûpakkhandhā, vedanā-kkhandhā, saññā-kkhandhā, sañkhārakkhandhā* and *viññānak- khandhā*, or *rûpa*-*vedanā-saññā, sañkhāra-viññāna* respectively. When you come acroos such usage, note that they all refer to the *upādānakkhandhā*s, the object of vipassanā meditation. In the *viññānakkhandhā* is mentioned *lokīcitta*. These *lokīcitta*s, however, refer only to those that can arise in one’s *santāna*s (life continuum). Note also that the cetasika refers to those associated with the corresponding *citta*s.]  
ūūūū
DISCERN _NāMA-RÛPA_ SEPARATELY
ūū
_Iti rûpakkhandho rûpam, cattāro arûpno khandhā nāmanti evameko pañcakkhandhavasena nāmarûpam vavatthapeti_ (_Visuddhi_ 2: 225).
ūū
Discern _rûpa_ and _nāma_ separately as “_rûpadhamma_ and _nāmadhamma_ as follows

3. _Rûpakkhandhā_ is tūe _rûpadhamma_. ū
4. The four-fold _nāma khandhā_ is the _nāmadhamma_
   ūū
   This is the way the _rûpa-nāma_ are discerned by method of the five-fold *khandhā*s. This is the way all the *rûpadhamma*s and *lokī nāma khandhā*s are collectively concentrated upon.

5. _Arûpasammûlhā_ = he who lacks clear consciousness on the _nāmadhamma_.\*
6. _Samkhittaruci_ = he who enjoys any thing concise.
7. _Tikkhapaññāvā_ = intelligent and sharp-minded person

With reference to the above three kinds of person, the Buddha has to expound the vipassanā meditation by method of _khandhā desanā_.

Discerning collectively in this way can be accomplished only by sharp-minded person. The following meditation method is given for slow-minded persons.
ūū
DISCERNING IN DETAIL — THE FIVE-FOLD _KHANDHā_ METHOD

_Ittha hi cakkhu ceva rûpañca rûpakkhandho, dassanam viññānā-kkhandho, tam-sampayuuta vedanā vedanā-kkhandho, saññā saññā-kkhandho, phassādikā sañkhārakkhando_. _Evametesam pañcannam khandhānam sammavāye ālokanavilokanam_

_paññāyati_. _Tattha ko eko āloketi, ko viloketi_ (*Ma.-Ttha.-*1: 267 - 268).
ūū
In the _pañcadvāravīthi_ (the five-door consciousness process) at a thought moment of consciousness by way of sight, the straight visualization and visualization at a glance vividly appear when the five-fold corporeality are captured together as

6. The eye clear element and _rûpārammana_ are the _rûpakkhanda_ (aggregate of matter),
7. The consciousness by way of sight, having visual capability, is the aggregate of consciousness,
8. The _vedanā_ (suffering) associated with the aggregate of consciousness is the aggregate of sensation or feeling group.,
9. The perception is the aggregate of perception,
10. The contact etc., of the five-fold mind and mental concomitant are the aggregate

 of mental formation.

 Now which individual would have straight visualization and which one has

glancing ability? (What it means is that there is neither any individual of straight visualization nor glancing, it is only the phenomenon of the five-fold aggregate coming

together.)

As explained in many places above, the consciousness by way of sight cannot arise without the _pañcadvāravajjana_ (apprehension through the five sense doors), nor _sampaticchana, santirana, vuttho_, nor impulsion if it is _mahantārammana_, nor the impulsion- _tadārammana_ (the then object) if it is _atimahntārammana_. Because of this, the five-fold aggregate as the object of concentration, at the thought moment of consciousness by way of sight, has been indicated by the Commentator. Note that it is described as an instruction made via _upalakkhana_ (way of distinguishing) and _nidassana_ (compartive way). Therefore, the five-fold aggregate is taken as the object of meditation on consciousness by way of sight, so also is it in the following.

7. The five-fold aggregate in _pañcadvārāvajjana_,
8. The five-fold aggregate in _sampaticchana_,
9. The five-fold aggregate in _santīrana_,
10. The five-fold aggregate in _vuttho,_
11. The five-fold aggregate in _javana_ (impulsion),
12. The five-fold aggregate in _tadārammana_,

Again in _manodvāravīthi_ (in *manodvāravīthi*s that follows)

4. The five-fold aggregate in _manodvārawajjana_,
5. The five-fold aggregate in each _javana_,
6. The five-fold aggregate in each *tadārammana*s,

 Note that it is the same in cases of _sotadvāravīthi_ etc.
ūū
A GOOD DISCIPLINE
ūūū
In meditation on _rûpa-nāma_ by way of the five-fold _khandhā_, practice along the rows have been found to have a clearer consciousness. Refer back to the good groups along the _rûpārammana_ rows in the table of _Kammatthāna_. Take _cakkhu-dvāravīthi_ and _manodvāravīthi_ (eye-door thought process and mind-door thought process), influenced by _mahākusala_ (great moral) impulsion, which occupy the first row of the table as an example. The concentration is made described below.

6. The 54 species of corporeality as object together with _rûpārammana_ of each and every _cittakhana_ (thought moment) in the _cakkhudvāravīthi_ and _manodvāravīthi_ are understood by wisdom as **_rûpa_**, **_rûpa_** ……..
7. Every _vedanā_ (suffering) associated with each _cittakhana_ are taken as object and understood by wisdom as **\*vedanā**, **vedanā\*** ….
8. Every _saññā_ (perception) associated with each _cittakhana_ are taken as object and understood by wisdom as **_saññā_,** **_saññā_** ….
9. All *cetasika*s (mental coūcomitants), other than _vedanā-saññā_, are taken together as object and understood by wisdom as **_sañkhāra_,** **_sañkhāra_** ….
10. Every _citta_ (consciousness) associated with each _cittakhana_ are taken as object and understood by wisdom as **_viññāna_,** **_viññāna_** ….

The good and bad groups in _rûpārammana_ are meditated in similar ways. Note that the same applies to those along the _saddārammana_ (sound base).

WHAT TO CONCENTRATE UPON WHEN UNDERSTOOD

If you have successfully practiced up to stage mentioned above, you should be  
ūūū
able to answer the question. If not, the answer follows.

At every thought moment of _manodvāravīthi_, that* continue taking as object *cakkhudvāravīthi rûpārammana* that appears while discerning on the *rûpārammana*, the ultimate truth and *dhātu* essence of the *rûpa-nāma\* should be understood by wisdom as follows.

4. **Four each of _āyatana_** according to _āyatana desanā_ ways.
5. **Four each of _dhātu_** according to _dhātu desanā_ ways. ū
6. **Five each of _khandhā_** according to _khandhā desanā_ ways.

Now this is the answer to the above query. This answer is just made refering to _nāma- rûpapariccheda ñāna_ (insight knowledge of mind and matter)* = *ditthivisuddhi\* (purification of views).

 Suppose you have come up to _paccayapariggaha ñāna_ (knowledge of discerning the cause and result), you must discern the cause and result at every thought moment. (This will be appreciated well in section on Paticcasamppāda).

A meditator ultimate reality of every individual of the ultimate element of the five- fold aggregate, by way of _lakkhana-rasa-paccupatthāna_-_padatthāna_, at individual thought moment of the _cakkhudvāravīthi_ and _manodvāravīthi_ , when he has come up to Lakkhanādicatukka. (This will be clear in section on Lakkhanādicatukka).

Again, if the meditator has attained the stage of _viappsanā_ he will have to concentrate on the three general characters, _anicca-dukkha-anatta_, of the **\*khandhā**, **āyatana\*** and **_dhātu_**, which are present at every thought moment of the _cakkhudvāravīthi_ and _manodvāravīthi_. (This will be clear in section on Vipassanā). It is the same in the case of concentration on sound.

All these are instructions of the Pāli-Atthakathā-Tīkā indicating how, when and what to discern regarding the _paramatta_ elements while at seeing and hearing stages.

For the meditators who are searching for the true *dhamma*s of the Buddha the Sabbaññuta Sammāsambuddha, those who are willing to penetratively understand, even in this existence, _asankhatadhātu_, the element of peacefulness leading to the Path and the Fruit, those who are eager to be delivered from the _apāya_ (miserable existences), those who are willing to be relieved entirely of the miserable ageing, death and decay, these are

the instructions to take to heart, follow carefully and obediently.

HE WHO DEFIES ABHIDHAMMā
ū
_Abhidhammam patibāhunto imassamin jinacakke pahāram deti, sabbaññutaññānam patibāhati, satthu vesārijjañānam patinivatteti, sotumākam parisam visamvādeti, ariya- magge āvaranam bandhati_. _Atthārasasu bhedakaravatthusu ekassamin sandissati, ukkhepanīyakammakijjanīyakammāraho hoti_. _Tam tam lammam katvā uyojetabbo “gaccha vighāsādo hutvā jīvissatī”ti_ (_Abhi.-Ttha_.-1: 30).

The above descriptions in the Atthakathā are a warning to those who deny that the Abhidhammā is not admonished by the Buddha, and to those who are under the impression that the _vipassanā_ exercise need not be made on the ultimate truth of _rûpa_ and _nāma_, called the _khandhā_, _āyatana_ and _dhātu_, as instructed in the Abhidhammā. What it  
ūū
really means is as follows.

One who rejects the fact that Abhidhammā is Buddha’s expatiation and hinders it, and that the _rûpa_ and _nāma_, called the truth of _khandhā_, _āyatana_, and _dhātu_, that have been expounded in the Abhidhammā should not and need not be meditated, is in fact hindering and deviating from the Buddha’s noble _sāsanā_. He is preventing the Buddha’s _sabbaññnuta ñāna_ knowledge of Omniscience. He lets down the Buddha’s brave _vesārajja ñāna_ (the brave knowledge of perfect self-confidence). He misleads those who are willing to listen to and practice the Abhidhamma dhamma (= _rûpa-nāma_ in Abhi-dhammā are not concerned with *sāvaka*s but are for Sabbaññ Sammāsambuddha and the *Arahant*s—those who are willing to listen to the Abhidhammā are misled in this way to an erroneous concept). It is the same as blocking the Path leading attain nobleness; it is one of distinct the factors that causes that brought about dissention among the Sanghā
ū
 called _bhedakara_ (causing disunion in the Sanghā).

That _Mahāthera_ should neglected from daily affairs by the Sanghā and to relieve him from the Buddhist order = an act of _upakkhepaniyakam_. He should be censured by Sanghā by way of _tajjniyakam_. [What it means is: the argument that Buddhabhāsita (Buddha’s utterances) Abhidhamma is not the Buddhabhāsita is referred to as _vivāda_ (contention). “The Buddha Abhidhammā would not bestow any benefit on human beings, the *sāvaka*s cannot meditate on the ultimate truth of the _rûpa_ and _nāma_, how could any one concen-trate on these hundreds of millions of *nāma dhamma*s which would have arisen and perished away within a blinking moment.” The demerit of the Abhidhamma are again indicated in this way. Now the argument on the Abhidhammā from negative side means committing _dhamma avannabhāsana_ (speaking bad of

dhamma). The _ukkhepaniyakam_ as well as _tajjaniya_ action should be taken on him.].

By taking these actions he should be sent off ordering him “Eater of others’ remainder—Make your living as a pauper.” (_Abhi.-Tha_.-1: 30).

Gentlemen, if you are willing to attain nibbāna, be careful not criticize the Abhidhamma without reason and be obedient to the warnings contained in the above Atthakathā.
ū
**THE FOUR-FOLD _VESāRAJJA ÑāNA_**

Bhikkhûs …. The Buddha’s brave knowledge called _vesārajja ñāna_ are of four-fold. The Lord fully endowed with these *vesārajja ñāna*s has declared himself to be the highest and possessed of sabbaññuta ñāna. He possesses self-confidence in preaching of the way leading to salvation to the people. He sets into Motion the Wheel of Truth.  
ū
These four are as follows.

5. The Buddha who declares himself to have penetratively realized, without any one’s help, by _sayambhû ñāna_ (self-dependent knowledge) and to be the Sammāsambuddha (the perfectly enlightened one), said “I have acquired peace and tranquility, freedom and bravery, because no one, be a _sāmana_, a _byamana_, a _devā_, a _māra_, in this world can argue as there still are *dhamma*s that I have not realized.”
6. To the Buddha, who has declared himself to be a _khināsava_ (one whose mind is free from the mental obsessions), in whom all the _āsava dhammas_ have been extinguished
    1. an _Arahant_, it has been asserted as “such and such _āsava_ still remained to be extinguished.” I have not come across any _nimitta_ (sign), in either _samana_, or _byamana_, or _deva_, or _māra_ or any one in this world, who could have the right reason to indicate so. For this reason I have attained the peace and tranquility, freedom and bravery.
7. “The* assertion that the *dhamma*s that I have admonished are impediment to *jāna- magga-phala* is, in fact, not so to those who practice these *dhamma*s.” I have not encountered any *nimitta* in either the *samana*, or *byamana*, or *deva*, or *māra\* or any one in this world, who could have the right reason to indicate so. For this reason I have come to acquire the peace and tranquility, freedom and bravery.
8. “The indications that the *dhamma*s that I have given for purpose of cessation of the suffering from the rounds of rebirth, in fact, cannot afford deliverance to any one practicing on these *dhamma*s.” I have not encountered any _nimitta_ in either the _samana_, or _byamana_, or _deva_, or _māra_ or any one in this world, who could have the right reason to indicate so. For this reason I have come to acquire the

 peace and tranquility, freedom and bravery.

Bikkhus ---- These are the 4-fold _vesārajja nanas_ causing bravery. The Buddha, endowed with these _vesārajja nanas_ and admitting to possess _sabbaññuta ñāna_, delivered the *dhamma*s bravely and set the wheel of _dhamma_ into motion (_Am_.-1: 315. _Vesārajja-Suttana_).
ū
Of these four-fold _vesārajja ñāna_, pay a careful attention to the fourth _vesārajja ñāna_.

As has been repeatedly explained previously—in Salāyatanavagga Samyutta Pāli Aparijānana-Suttana that if the _rûpa_ and _nāma dhamma_ not completely understood analytically by means of the 3-fold pariñña paññā to attain the _magga_ and _phala_, there is  
ūū
no way of liberating from the suffering of sansāric circus (_Sam_.-2: 249 – 250).

The eight noble *dhamma*s, called pubbbhāga satipatthāna magga preceding the _ariya magga_ (the Noble Path) have to be meditated, by the three-fold _pariññā paññā_ to analytically realize the _rûpa_ and _nāma_ so as to attain _magga_ and _phala_. The 8-fold magga, the noble practice, are the *niyyānika dhamma*s (sanctifying factors) leading to salvation. In other words, if these 8-fold *magga dhamma*s are practiced step by step, the _rûpa_ and _nāma_ are analytically realized by the 3-fold _pariñña paññā_ to have attained the _magga_ and _phala_. Such a realization itself is the _niyyānika dhamma_ delivering one from  
ūū
the suffering of sansāric circus\* (the rounds of rebirth).

Suppose you are under the impression that “the _rûpa_ and _nāma_ given in the Abhi- dhammā are not to be concentrated, but such and such phenomena, other than _rûpa_ and _nāma_, are to be concentrated in such and such a way.” With reference to such a person

the Atthasālini Atthakathā Sayādaw given an explanation.

“An individual who hinders the Abhidhammā is infact defying the noble dhamma called Buddha sasanā. He is reproving the _sabbaññuta ñāna_ of the Buddha. He is letting down the Buddha’s very brave _vesārajja nana_. He is misleading those gentle persons who are willing to listen to and to practice the good _dhamma_.” (_Abhi.-Ttha_.-1: 30). **Even a learned can err sometime**.

**THE _ITTHāRAMMANA_-_ANITTHāRAMMANA_ CONCEPT**

\2. _Samāsana Vāda_ (Theory of Similar Concept)
ū
To begin with, similar statements made by honorable teachers, called the _Samāsana vāda_, is be presented.

The _ārammana_ (the object) that is unpleasant and should not be sought (_rûpa-vedanā- saññā-sankhāra_) is the anitthārammana. Whoever seeks that ārammana, in fact, it is the ārammana that should not be concentrated upon. It is the kind of ārammana that is not acceptable, unglamorous, not to be taken to heart, that is not conducive to _kusala citta_ (meritorious mind).

In fact, it is completeness = far from pleasantness and hence an* unpleasant *āram- mana* that should not be accepted nor sought after. [The *Sampatti* here refers to *sampatti\* _bhava_ (blissful life) of sentient beings and *devā*s.]

In fact, the _anitthārammana_ (physically), among the _kamma_-produced corpo-reality, are the results of karmically unwholesome deeds. (These are the _vipāka nāma_

groups that have arisen from the _akusala kamma_ of _nāma dhamma_).

Because it not the cause for the _sukhavedanā_, this _ārammana_ should not be acceptable. Because it is not the true cause for the _sukhavedanā_ in the kind of _citta_ that is not conducive to mental faculty.
ū
In this mind-produced corporeality, the five-fold _ārammana karmaguna_ (5-fold craving) produced by _akusala kamma_ are all _anitthārammana_. There is not such a thing as _anitthārammana_ in _kamma_-produced corporeality arising from _kusala kamma_. All the _kamma_-produced corporeality following the _kusala kamma_ are the _itthārammana_ (Abhi.- Ttha.-2: 8-9).

The arising of the _kamma_-produced _ittha-anittha_ is related to the sentient being bringing about that _kamma_-produced corporeality. If a living being has cultivated _akusala kamma_, then it will encounter an _anittārammana kamma_-produced corporeality. If it is the _kusala kamma_ that is cultivated, an _itthārammana kamma_-produced corporeality will be the result in due course. **_Tasmā kammajanam itthanitthatā kamma-kārakasatthassa vasena yojanārahā siya_**. (_Mûlatī_.-2: 8).

**A CUP OF PRICELESS MEDICINE**

The explanations given by this Atthakathā-tīkā are a priceless medicine for a gentle man. The encounter of various unpleasant _anitthārammana_ is the result of the cultivation of _akusala kamma_ in the past. One should not grumble by various sorts reasons as “It is because of something that it has occurred. If so, then you are committing

a great blunder referred to as _ayoniso manasikara_ (a purposeless attention).

When the _kusala kamma_ is still in force, then that _kamma_ will always be creating encounters with discontent _ārammana_ and the discontent sentient beings. Whenever the anitthārammana are encountered, and if they can be taken heart as “well, every body is the nmaker of his own future,” then in your _santāna_ (life-continuum) _yonisomanasikara_ ( a wise attention), the true basic causes of _kusala_, has made its appearance. If the three characters of anitthārammana are concentrated by vipassanā until their ultimate truth is acquired, then it is a kind of _yonisomanasikara_ which has attained the peak of _vipassanā_  
ū
_ñāna_ (insight knowledge).

**AN EXPLANATION BY _MÛLATĪKā_**
ū
 The above _atthakathā_ has explained—**_kusalakammajam anittham nāma natthi_** = as a rule, _kamma_-produced corporeality resulting from _kusala kamma_ never is an _anitthā_- _rammana_. The explanation does not include **_Akusalakammajam nittham nāma natthi_** =

as a rule, _kamma_-produced corporeality resulting from _akusala kamma_ never is an _itthā_- _rammana_. Because of this situation, if _akusala kamma_-produced _rûpa_ happens to be pleasant (even though it is an _anitthārammana_ for you who have cultivated _akuso kamma_ beforehand), it may be _itthārammana_ for other sentient beings. Again other teachers are of the opinion that all the _kuso kamma_-produced corporealities are _itthārammana_ for both  
ū
self and others.

As a continuation further explanations will be given. Some sentient beings do not appreciate nor like the human features and his appearance. Because of this dislike they would run away from his presence. In the same way humans are frightened by the appearance and features of the *devā*s. Though the humans and sentient beings are scared away, the _cakkhuviññāna_ (visual perception) etc. of _vipākaviññāna_ (resultant perception) takes that corporeality as object (physical object) that has arisen in the _santāna_ of these frightened beings, appear as just the _kusalavipākaviññāna_. Similarly, in living beings scared of humans and humans scared of the *devā*s, these features as _ārammana_ cannot be pleasant because they lack the power resulting from good deed. This is the opinion of the some *kecisayā*s. (The idea of _kecisayā_’s is that all _kusala kamma_-produced corporealities are _itthāramman_. Those who do not have adequate power in their _santāna_ find these not charming when they come across these _itthārammana_. As the mûlatīkāsayādaw disagrees with these assertions, he has retorted as follows.)

The explanation of the _Atthakathā sayā_ is that the absence of _anitthārammana_ in all _kusala_ the _kamma_-produced corporeality as well as the absence of the pleasant _itthārammana_ in all the _akusalakamma-produced_ corporeality, is an apt explanation.

Indeed, the _kamma_-produced corporeality in the _santāna_ of the sentient beings,

like elephant etc. during the start of life, are the result of _akusala kamma_ performed during a certain past existence. The encounter by humans of the _akusala kamma_-produced corporeality of these beings, such as elephant etc., are the _akusalavipākacitta_ that appear due to taking these as object in their _santāna_. (It means _Pañcaviññāna-sam- paticcha-nasantīrana-tadārammana_).

When such beings as elephant etc. has grown into adult after growing gradually, called _pavatti_ (formative stage), however, after period of rebirth stage, (to become a _mangala hsin_ (lucky elephant) the _kuso kamma_-produced corporeality have the chance to make its appearance. (The elephant, before attaining an elephant’s life when _akusala_ *dhamma*s are cultivated to attain such a life on one hand, while on the other hand _kusala_ meritorious deeds, such as _dāna_ (alms-offering), were made so that both _kusala_ and _akusala_ are amix. If rebirth resultant occurs because _akusala_ has acquired more chance, the _kusala kamma_ result can also arise so that _pavatti_ results may occur in continuation. By the power of _kusala kamma_, which could produce _pavatti_ results, _kusala kamma_- produced corporeality in the form of a white elephant etc. may make its appearance.)

By taking as object the _kusala kamma_-produced corporeality of sentient beings, such elephant etc., called _itthārammana_, which have gradually grown at the time of _pavatti_ period, _kusalavipākacitta_ can arise in humans. (_Pañcaviññāna-sampaticchana- santīrana- tadārammana-citta_ is meant here.)

The encounter by humans of _itthārammana_ is also related to their _kusala kamma_,  
ūū
but not to that sentient beings such as elephant etc.

Although it is true that the _kamma_-produced corporeality of sentient beings such as elephants etc. can be an object of the human _kusalavipākaviññāna_, but in the santāna of the sentient beings can there be _itthārammana kamma_-derived corporeality as well as the _anitthārammana kamma_-derived corporeality. It means that as there can be _kusala kamma_- derived corporeality referred to as _itthārammana_, so can there be the akusala- kamma- produced corporeality, called the _initthāramma_. Therefore, the _itthārammana_ and _anitthārammana_ are mingled. In such a mingled state in the elephant etc., _anitthā_-_rammana rûpa_ called the _akusala kamma_-produced corporeality is only a minor case in the _santāna_ of it when maturity is attained at a time of _pavatti_ period. The _itthārammana_, the _kusala kamma_- derived corporeality (adequate enough to have attained the state of a _mangalā_ elephant) of the previous and present, however, is an overlapping major case. Therefore, however mingled the _itthārammana_ of _kusala kamma_-produced and _anitthā-rammana_ of _akusala kamma_-produced corporealities may be, the _akusala kamma_-produced _anitthārammana_, as a minority, cannot be the real cause for arising of the many _akusalvipākacitta_ in the _santāna_ of humans. Probably, it could be asserted this way. (In the _santāna_ of elephant etc., during the time of _pavatti_ period, only the _itthāramma_, which are the majority, is taken as object. In the _santāna_ of humans, concentrating on the _itthārammana_, _kusalavipākacitta_ has the chance to arise. For this reason, _akusala kamma_ produced-corporeality-_anitthārammana_ cannot be the cause for the appearance of the _akusalavipākacitta_ in the humans. This is what the whole idea is meant). (Mûlatī-2: 8).
ū
**THE OUTSTANDING FRATURES OF THE TWO _VÃDA_**S\*\*

According to the _kecivāda_ the splendid material forms, arising in the sentient beings such elephants when they have gradually attained maturity, are only the _anitthā-rammana_ _rûpa akusala kamma_-produced corporeality due to their cultivation in the past  
ūūūūūūūū
of the _akusalakamma_.

According to Mûlatīkāsayādaw, the _patisandhe kammaja rûpa_ (_kamma_-produced rebirth phenomena) of the elephant etc. are only the _akusala kamma_-produced _anitthā- rammana rûpa_. It has been exsaptiated that the splendid *rûpa*s, which appear at _pavatti_ period when maturity is attained, are the *kusokammajarûpa*s = the *itthārammana rûpa*s, which were cultivated in the past existence of these sentien beings. (That is to mean that the ugly and inferior *rûpa*s are the _akusalakammaja rûpas_. It is consistent with Añgutta- ranikāya Dassakanippātti Jānusoni-suttana. See _Am_. 3: 478 – 482).
ū
**\*So tattha lābhī hotī**ti so tattha hatthiyoniyam nibbattopi mañgalahatthitthānam patvā lābhī hoti*. (*Am.- ṭha.* 3: 339).
ūūūūūū
In the *santāna* of elephant etc., during pavatti period, although the *itthārammana rûpa\*

-   _akusalakammaja rûpa_ and _anitthārammana rûpa_ = _akusalakammaja rûpa_ are intermingled, the latter are infinitesimal, but *kusalakammaja rûpa*s are of considerable magnitude. Therefore, the Mûlatīkāsayādaw is of the opinion that such an infinitesimal *akusalakammaja rûpa*s cannot be the cause for the arising of _akusalavipākacitta_ in the _santāna_ of sentient beings like humans. The sayādaw once again expounded as given below.
    ū
    _Vipākam pana kattaco na sakka vañcetunti vipākavasena itthānitthārammanava-vatthānam sutthu vuttam_. _Tasmā tam anugantvā sabbattha itthānitthatā yojetabbā._
    ūū
     (_Mûlaṭī_- 2: 8).

Again in whichever _ārammana_ it may be, the _vipākviññāna_ cannot be deceived. Because of this determination of _itthārammana_ or _anitthārammana_ by virtue of _vipākaviññāna_ (_Abhi.Ttha.-_ 2:10), as explained by Tipitakasûlābhayathera, has been mentioned in attakthā. Therefore, the determination _ittha_ and _anittha_ by power of that _vipākaviññāna_ only, the formation of _ittha_ and _anittha ārammana_ should be associated (Mûla*ṭ*ī.-2: 8).

Now this is the similarity of meaning by all the _atthakathā sayādaws_, the similar _attakathā_ = _samanavāda_.

_VITANTA VāDĪ VāDA_

SOPHISTRY

An individual who would make fallacious speech that could disheartened the men  
ū
of wisdom is the vitandavādī (a sophist). He would speak oout as

**\*Itthānittham** nāma pātiyekkam pativibattam natthi*, *tesam tesam rûcivasena kathitam\* (Abhi.-Ttha.-2: 9).

There is no such a thing a the _itthārammana_ and _anitthārammana_ which can be analyzed individually as a single item each. Determination of an _ārammana_ as either the _itthārammana_ or the _anitthārammana_ is related to individual living being’s like or dislike of it (that _ārammana_). To the Great King Kosala the Buddha himself has admonished as follows.

-   The Great King …. Among the five-fold _kāmaguna ārammana_, I have indicated that

only the _ārammana_ that is attractive and the heart’s liking is the extreme determinant and is noble. The Great King …. Even that individual *årammana*s can be a heart stimula-ting for some, but not for the others. The Great King …. A single kind of sounds, smells, tastes and touches can be the balm to the heart of some, but not to that of others.” This what the Lord has expatiated in Sagāthā-vaggakosala-samyutta Pañcarāja-suttana (Sam.-
ū
1: 80).

With reference to the method as indicated above, a single _rûpārammana, saddā_- _rammana, ganfhārammana, pholabbārammana_ etc. may be pleasant and attractive _ārammana_ for one, and cause the arising of clinging, attachment and _lobha_ (greed) to that _ārammana_. To the other these *ārammana*s could cause anger, a feeling of sorrow, and hate. These *ārammana*s themselves may be the attractive, pleasing and adorable *itthāramman*s for one. These may again be the disgusting, disagreeable and unadorable

*anitthārammana*s for the other.

The same *ārammana*s are taken by optimist as pleasing and adorable, on the other hand, they displeasing unadorable for a pessimist. Therefore, there no such a thing

as _ittārammana_ separate from _anitthārammana_ in its own entity.

In fact countrymen living in the extreme periphery _paccantavāthī_) of the Majjhimadesa (the Middle Region) would find even the earthworms to be _itthārammana_, _attractive_ and _adorable_. For those living right inside the Majjhimadesa, however, would find these earthworms to be _anitthārammana_, irritable and rejectable. Again the _paccan-tavāthī_, the countrymen, would find the meat of peacock to be irritable, inedible and unpleasant. This is the the way of thinking of vitantavādī with regard to itthārammana

and anitthārammana (Abhi.-Ttha.-2: 9).

THE REPLY

In response to the idea of _vitantavādī_, the _atthakathā_ has retored as follow. Ask the vitantavādī as

Do you mean there is no such a thing as _itthārammana_ and _anitthārammana_ in its entity to determine separately?

Suppose his answer was “_āma natthi_ = well, no, there is not.” Ask him the same question three times, and make him answer _āma natthi_ three times admittedly. After- wards give him a problem to see what his answer would be.

The question is “Is the _Nibbāna atta_ or _anatta_”? The _vitanta vādī_ might answer, through knowledge of his own, indeed nibbāna is the _itthārammana_.

He might remain silent, but in fact nibbāna is the _itthārammana_.

Some people are sensitive and become angry when the merits of the nibbāna are mentioned, and would angrily answer as follow.

Well now you are talking about the merits and goodness of the _nibbāna_. I would like to ask you if there were adequate and various kinds of eatables, flowers, perfume, essence, cosmetics, clothings and place to sleep—the five-fold _kāmaguna ārammana_ in

the nibbāna?

The answer to question put by the _vitanda vādī_ would simply be “No.” If such an answer is given by _sakavādī_, a person whose idea is with the framework of the _sāsanā_, and in continuation the _vitanda vādī_ should be told: You would close your ears and say

“No. _Alam tava nibbānena_ = your nibbāna would be not advantageous.”

The great noble _nibbāna dhamma_ is indeed an _itthārammana_. Even though it is so, there are no five-fold *kāmaguna ārammana*s to enjoy, for which the _nibbāna_ when

viewed from the _vitanda vādī_’s standpoint comes to be known as _anitthārammana_.

_Anitthārammana_ it may be for those who does not want, the great noble _nibbāna dhamma_ should not and must not be taken as _anitthārammana_. A person who implied the nibbāna to be anittha is one who possesses _viparitasaññā_ (altered perception) = wrong perception associated with the _lobha_ (greed) associated with the enjoyment of the five-fold *kāmaguna ārammana*s. Because of this wrong perception, he has asserted the remark “Hold it. There is no benefit derivable from your nibbāna.”

Because of changes of perception = _vippanlāsa_ (transposition) alteration in the perception, an _ārammana_ may be _itthārammana_ for one who is in search of it. At the same time that _ārammana_ may be disagreeable and unacceptable for another (Abhi.- Ttha.-2: 9 – 10).

Now these are the assertions in atthakathā made in response to that of the _vitanda_

_vādī_.

**_SAÑÑāVIPALLāSA_**

(**THE CONCEPT TRANSPOSITION**)

The perceptions associated with _lobha_ clinging to the *kāmaguna ārammana*s, which are not the true _ittha_, and believe them to be the _ittha_, the _nibbāna dhamma_ and other *ārammana*s which are wrongly taken to be the true _anitth_—the perceptions which here are said to be _viparitasaññā_ = perceptions subject to changes. That _viparitasaññā_ is again explained as _saññāvipallāsa_. Because of the _viparitasaññā_ the nibbāna, which lacks *kāmaguna ārammana*s inform of food and enjoyable substances, he simply honestly said “alam tava nibbānena = That is enough. There is no benfit in your nibbāna.” The majority of the present day persons wishing for “immediate attainment of _nibbāna_” are, infact, usually have one thing in mind and another in the mind. They want to acquire the nibbāna in no time. They, however, do not practice in the right way to attain the nibbāna following the right path. Having a heart of acquiring nibbāna, though they cannot practice presently, should be said to have a great merit.
ū
**THE THREE-FOLD _VIPALLāSA_**
ū
**\*Vipallāsā**ti anicca-dukkha-anatta-asubhesuyeva vatthûsu iccam sukhan attā subha”ti evum pavatto saññāvipallāso cittavipallāso ditthivipallāso ime tayo\* (Visuddhi-2: 324).

In the five-fold *upādānakkhandhā rûpa-nāma dhamma*s, which are the true _anicca, dukkha, anatta_ and _asubha_, in other words in the _dukkha-saccā_ and *samudaya-saccā dhamma*s, there are three-fold *vippllāsa*s:

4. Wrong perception as (a) _Nicca_, (b) _Sukha_, (c) _Atta_, (d) _Subha_ = _Saññāvipallāsa_
5. Wrong notion as (a) _Nicca_, (b) _Sukha_, (c) _Atta_, (d) _Subha_ = _Cittavipallāsa_
6. Wrong view as (a) _Nicca_, (b) _Sukha_, (c) _Atta_, (d) _Subha_ = _Ditthivipallāsa._

In this way there are three-fold *vippllāsa*s as _Saññāvipallāsa, Cittavipallāsa,_ and _Ditthivipallāsa._ There are four categories in each making it 12-fold of _vippllāsa_ _dham-_

*ma*s (Visuddhi-2: 324).

Perceptions subject to change = _viparitasaññā_ arise because the *vippalāsa dhamma*s distinctly do exist from which no deliverance has been attained. Based on the _viparita saññā_, the living beings wrongly perceived _ittha_ as _anittha_ and vice versa. They are having wrong notions and wrong perceptions and these are, indeed, the _ayoniso manasikāra_ (the unwise attensions). There is every possibility that *akusala dhamma*s

could arise based on these _ayoniso maniasikāra_.

**DETERMINATION OF _IṭṭHāRAMMANA_ AND _ANIṭṭHāRAMMANA_ ACCORDING**

**INDIVIDUALS OF MEDIOCRE LIVING BEINGS**

_Iṭṭhānitthārammanam pana pātiyakkam vibhattam aṭṭhīti_. _Kassa vasena vibhattanti_? _Majjhimakasattassa_ (_Abhi.- ṭṭha_.-2: 10).

Determination of _iṭṭhārammana_ and _iniṭṭhārmmana_ is given in the _Aṭṭhakathā_. It is not ture that there never exist _iṭṭhārammana_ and _aniṭṭhārammaṇa_ as asserted by the _vitandavādī_. Then how is it determined which are _iṭṭhāramaṇa_ and which are _aniṭṭhārammaṇa_? The explanation in the Aṭṭhakathā is that it is made by virtue of wish a Mediocre person.

Further explanation. Determination of an _ārammaṇa_ as either _iṭṭha_ or _aniṭṭha_ should, however, be made by virtue of the great president, the King Mahāsudassanasak-kāya, King Dhammāsoka etc., who are of great power. Indeed, these powerful rulers, belonging to the higher strata, are not contended with nor appreciate an _ārammana_ like ordinary foods, of celestial origin, comparable to the five-fold _ārammana karmaguna_, though the food is an _itthāramman_. In their mind this _ārammana_ is taken to heart as not

appreciable nor stumlating to their heart.

For very poor, and of low strata, humans and sentient beings for whom getting a daily meal is hard effort, even the meal made broken rice, foul rice and curry would be delicious and will be _ittha_ though it is indeed _anittha_.
ū
In dertermining whether an _ārammana_ is _ittha_ or _anittha_, it should be according to the middle class humans’ (Pāmokkha, Minister, rich man, merchant etc.) definition.

Therefore, good _rûpa-sadda-gandha-rasa-pholabba-dhamma_ for middle class humans are all *itthārammana*s. The hard-to-come-by physical appearance and the sound of the Sammasambuddha etc. and those of man and woman are very pleasant and adorable *ati- itthārammana*s. The smell of faecal materials, rotten dead dog and man are of repulsive

kinds; disturbing sounds, unpleasant smell, disagreeable tastes and touches are *anitthārammana*s. This is how determination is made regarding the _itthārammana_ and _anitthārammana_. This is the _atthakathāvāda_; the _samānavāda_. (_Abhi.-Ttha_.-2: 10).  
ū
In this _vāda_, note that the formation of _ittha_ or _anittha_ on an object among the upper. Medium and lower strata humans does not occur during the _vipākaviññāna_, but during by **_javanasena_** = the force of _javanna_ (impulsion)  
ū
**_TIPIṭAKACÛLāBHAYATTHERA VāDA_**

_Tipiṭakacûļābhayatthero panāha — “Iṭṭhāniṭṭham nāma vipākavasena paricchinnam, na javanavasena. Javanam pana saññāvippallāsavasena iṭṭhassamim yeva rijjati_, _iṭṭhas-samim yeva dussati_. _Aniṭṭhassamim yeva rijjati_, _aniṭṭhassamim yeva dussatī"ti_. _Vipākavaseneva panetam ekantato paricchijjati_. _Na hi sakkā vipākacittam vañcetom_. _Sace ārammaṇam iṭṭham hoti_, _kusalavipākam upajjati_. _Sace aniṭṭham_, _akusalavipākam_  
ū
_upajjati_ (*Abhi-ṭṭha-*2: 10).

The Venerable _Tipiṭakacûļābhayatthera_ has indicated as follows.

The _iṭṭhārammaṇa_ and _aniṭṭhārammaṇa_ are determined not by the force of _javana_ (impulsion) but by the force of _vipākaviññāṇa_ (consciousness acquired through practice). Because of wrong concept = the clinging, the attachment = may result in _lobha_, and also _dosa_, can be formed within a single _iṭṭhārammaṇa_ by force of _vipaļāsa_. Within a single _aniṭṭhārammaṇa_ can be formed the attachment = _lobha_, and also _dosa_. Therefore, the _iṭṭhārammaṇa_ and _aniṭṭhārammaṇa_ should not be determined on the basis of the force of _javana_.

Therefore, the _iṭṭhārammaṇa_ and _aniṭṭhārammaṇa_ should be determined only by virtue of _vipākaviññāṇa_. In fact _vipākacitta_ never deceives. An _ārammaṇa_ may be an _iṭṭhārammaṇa_—(let the _javana_ dominated by any one of _kusla_, _akusala_, _somanassa_, _do- manassa_, _upakkhā_), then the *vipākaviññāṇa*s are definitely _kusalavipāka, pañcaviññāṇa_, _sampaṭicchana_, _santīrana_ of *tadārammaṇa*s. An _ārammaṇa_ may be an _aniṭṭhāram-maṇa_— (let the _javana_ dominated by any one of _kusla_, _akusala_, _somanassa_, _do-manassa_, _upakkhā_), then the *vipākaviññāṇa*s are definitely _akusalavipāka, pañcaviññāṇa_, _sampaṭicchana_, _santīrana_ of *tadārammaṇa*s. For this reason, the determination of the

_iṭṭhārammaṇa_ and _aniṭṭhārammaṇa_ should, in deed, be made by virtue of _vipākaviññāṇa_. _Kiccāpi hi micchādiṭṭhikā Buddham vā samgham vā mahācetiyādīni vā uļārāni āram-manāni disvā ekkhīni pidahanti_, _domanassam āpajjanti_, _dhammasaddam sutvā kaṇṇe thakanti_, _cakkhuviññāṇasotaviññāṇāni pana nesam kusalaviākāneva honti_ (*Abhi-ṭṭha-*2: 10). _Micchādiṭṭhi_ (wrong viewers), those with conception outside the bounds of the _sāsanā_,turn their blind eyes when they encounter _Sammāsambuddha_ (the Enlightened One), or Ariya- Sanghā (the Noble Sanghā) or Mahā-Cetiya (e.g. Shwedagon) etc. of noble *ārammaṇa*s; feel unhappy at heart. They would close their ears when the Buddha's sermon is heard.
