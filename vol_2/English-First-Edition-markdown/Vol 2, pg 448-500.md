**PAGE-448 V. Section of (4) kinds of mindfulness foundation (*saṭipaṭṭhāna*)** 

There are (4) kinds of mindfulness foundation called ***saṭipaṭṭhāna*** ***dhammas*** viz,  

1. ***kāyānupassanā  saṭipaṭṭhāna***  (contemplation  on  bodily  constituents  as  mindfulness foundation); 
1. ***vedanānupassanā saṭipaṭṭhāna*** (contemplation on feeling as mindfulness foundation); 
1. ***cittānupassanā  saṭipaṭṭhāna***  (contemplation  on  consciousness  as  mindfulness foundation); 
1. ***dhammānupassanā  saṭipaṭṭhāna***  (contemplation  on  ***dhamma***  as  mindfulness foundation). 

Those  are  also  known  as  four  kinds  of  ***anupassanā***  (repeated  discerning  or contemplation). Among those four kinds, if corporeality-mentality and their causal ***dhammas*** are discerned as object of ***vipassanā*** practice through generalizing as three general characters called ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta*** after corporeal ***dhammas*** are kept in mind as priority and then mentality and causal ***dhammas*** of those corporeality-mentality are scrutinized, that kind of mindfulness foundation can be designated as ***kā***y***ānupassanā saṭipaṭṭhāna***. In this work, it has been presented, until present section, ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna***, on the following first stages, namely, 

1) ***ānāpānapabba –*** first stage (Please see Volume I, page 241,242) 
1) ***iriyāpathapabba*** – first stage (Please see Volume I, page 735) 
1) ***sampajaññapabba*** – first stage (Please see Volume I, page 752) 
1) ***dhātumanasikārapabba –*** first stage respectively. (Please see Volume I, page 553,554)\* 

There are so many stages to be practiced continuously. The righteous ***meditator*** should like to see again those first stages in volume I and it will be presented brief way of discerning up to the Fruit-Knowledge of Arahant through four elements meditation in order to avoid skeptical doubt on way of practice leading to ***nibbāna***. 

That way of practice in brief can be found in the commentary called ***sammohavinodanī*** as follows: \_\_\_\_\_

(v).1. Towards the Fruith-Knowledge of Arahant through four elements meditation 

***Pāli* *Quotation* (*Abhi-A-2-241-242*)** 

When the practising ***bhikkhu*** discerns four great elements in (6) doors, (42) bodily parts he usually sees white expanse or transparent expanse and then if he continues to discern  ![](Aspose.Words.1dcd4a36-afff-4324-9383-0b06130ef926.001.png)

* ***These page numbers are original Myanmar Text and it needs to change numbers of English Text*** 

four great elements within those white expanse, transparent expanse, he will see corporeal units.  Unless  corporeal  unit  can  be  seen  easily,  he  has  to  scrutinize  space-element continuously and then he will see corporeal units finally. When four great elements which are consisting in corporeal units lying in (6) doors, (42) bodily parts can be discriminated by the help of insight knowledge (24) kinds of derived corporealities become apparent **… R …**  

When  those  derived  corporealities  become  apparent  in  that  way  the  practising ***meditator*** discriminates in such way that “four  great elements and (23) kinds of derived corporealites (= if heart-base is also counted in those corporealities, (24) kinds of derived coprorealities) are corporeal aggregate (***rūpakkhandhā***) really. 

**PAGE-453** 

When corporeal aggregate is distinguished with the help of insight knowledge in this way  four  mental  aggregate become  apparent by  means of base-door  wise  system.  Those corporeal and mental ***dhammas*** which are kept in mind in this way, are only five kinds of aggregates. Five kinds of aggregates are only (12) bases. Twelve bases are only (18) kinds of elements.  Thus  corporeality  mentality  are  kept  in  mind  through  dividing  two  groups  by means of aggregates-bases-elements as paired shoot sprouting from palmyra-palm nut are separated into two parts. (It is Knowledge of Analyzing Mentality-corporeality. It is the stage of Purification of Views called ***diṭṭhivisuddhi***.) 

When that practising person scrutinized in such way that “these mentality-corporeality never  arise  in  the  absence  of  definite  cause  called  ***hetupaccaya***  or  ***janakapaccaya***  and supporting causes called ***paccaya*** factor or ***upatthambhaka*** factors but they usually arise in the presence of definite and supporting causes and which are these both kinds of causes?”, he can distinguish and keep in mind in such ways that  

1. due to presence of cause called ignorance (***avijjā***); 
1. due to presence of cause called craving (***taṇhā***) 
1. due to presence of cause called action (***kamma***) 
1. due to presence of cause called nutriment (***āhāra***); 

those mentality-corporeality arise. 

Then he overcomes skeptical doubts in three periods called past, future, present in such ways that  

1. in the past period there were only causal ***dhammas*** and only resultant ***dhammas*** which arise depending on causal ***dhammas***; 
1. in the future period there will be only causal ***dhammas*** and only resultant ***dhammas*** which arise depending on causal ***dhammas***; 
1. in this present period there are only causal ***dhammas*** and only resultant ***dhammas*** which arise depending on causal ***dhammas***. 

There is neither being nor person other than those causal and resultant ***dhammas***. There are only pure corporeality-mentality-causes-results called piles of pure  conditioned things.(It is the Knowledge of Discerning Cause and Condition called ***paccaya pariggaha ñāṇa***. It is the stage of Purification by Overcoming Doubts. It will be obvious in section of Dependent-Origination.) 

This  is  called ***ñātapariññā***  (=  full  understanding  on  objects)  which  is  capable  of penetrative discriminating and well keeping in mind 

1. corporeal ***dhammas***, 
1. mental ***dhammas***, 
1. causal ***dhammas***, 
1. resultant ***dhammas***, which are called conditioned things, which are object of ***vipassanā*** knowledge and are deserving to know and see penetratively. 

**PAGE-454** 

It  can  be  said  the  practising  ***bhikkhu***,  who  has  got  accomplishment  of  well discriminating on corporeality-mentality-cause-result in this way, lies in the root of Noble Teachings  of  the  Exalted  One  with  (10)  kinds  of  physical  strength  and  (10)  kinds  of intellectual strength through subscribing to ***dhamma***. (It means after conditioned things are kept  in  mind  by  the  knowledge  of  Discerning  Cause  and  Condition  the  Purification  by Overcoming Doubt arises in his continuum, resulting in taking root in the Supreme Buddha’s Admonishment so as not to separate from it.) 

It can be said he has got foothold in the Exalted One’s Noble Admonishment. He can be  said  as  Lesser  Upstream-enterer  called  ***cūļasotāpanna***  with  fixed  joyful  destination. (Purification of virtue and purification of consciousness must be accomplished as basis in order to reach these kinds of Purification of Views and Purification by Over-coming Doubt.) 

If favourable conditions, viz., 

1. ***utusappāya*** = favourable climate, 
1. ***puggalasappāya*** = favourable person, 
1. ***bhojanasappāya*** = favourable nourishment. 
1. ***dhammassavana  sappāya***  =  availability  to  listen  favourable  ***dhamma***  preaching  as ***Anatta Lakkhaṇa Sutta*** are available and if he discerns corporeality-mentality-cause- result  called  conditioned  things  as  three  general  characters,  ***anicca***,  ***dukkha***,  ***anatta*** through following cascade of ***vipassanā*** knowledge, ***sammasanañāṇa***, ***udayabbaya ñāṇa*** etc, after sitting with having folded his legs crosswise, the Fruit-Knowledge of ***Arahant*** is available. This is continuity of saying for practising ***bhikkhu*** who performs ***vipassanā*** practice  through  four  elements  meditation  so  as  to  reach  final  target  until  the  Fruit- Knowledge  of  ***Arahant***.  (***Abhi-A-2-241-242***).  (Way  of  ***vipassanā***  discerning  will  be explicit in the section of ***Vipassanā***, Volume V.) 

Explanations  of  above  commentary  should  be  read  carefully.  Four  elements- meditation does not mean discerning on pure four great elements up to the Fruit-Knowledge of ***Arahant*** but cascade of practices including stage of discerning on four great elements, stage of discerning on corporeal ***dhammas***, stage of discerning on mental ***dhammas***, stage of discerning on causal ***dhammas***, stage of ***vipassanā*** discerning, etc., step by step successively. 

Therefore, ***kāyānupassanā saṭipaṭṭhāna***, means a kind of mindfulness foundation in which ***vipassanā*** discerning must be performed by  generalizing on corporeality-mentality together with causal ***dhammas***, when stage of developing concentration is successful bodily constituents (=all corporeal ***dhammas***) are kept in mind as priority with the help of that concentration and then corporeality-mentality are kept in mind; afterwards causal ***dhammas*** of those corporeality-mentality must be scrutinized. 

**PAGE-455** 

It is because in ***Mahānidāna sutta***, ***Dīganikāya*** it is explained that \_\_\_\_\_ 

1. ***vipassanā*** discerning on pure corporeal ***dhammas*** can not bring forth to reach the Noble Path-Knowledge (= ***vuṭṭhānagāminī vipassanā*** is not available). 
1. ***vipassanā*** discerning on pure mental ***dhammas*** can not bring forth to reach the Noble Path-Knowledge (= ***vuṭṭhānagāminī vipassanā*** is not available). (***Abhi-A-1-270***) 
1. Unless  causal  relationship  (=  principle  of  dependent-origination)  is  known  and  seen penetratively by both kinds of ***anubodhañāṇa*** (= the knowledge gained through repeated discerning  over  and  over)  and  ***paṭivedha  ñāṇa***  (=the  penetrative  knowledge  gained through Supra-mundane-Path-Knowledge and the Fruit-Knowledge), suffering of rounds of rebirth can not be overcome. (***Dī-2-47, Mahā-nidāna sutta***.) 

Due to presence of these explanations, ***kāyānupassanā saṭipaṭṭhāna*** does not mean way of practice of mindfulness foundation by which pure corporeal ***dhammas*** are discerned up to ***nibbāna***. Every ***meditator*** should like to understand this fact really. 

Those sections which are inclusive in this ***kāyānupassanā saṭipaṭṭhāna***, i.e, 

1. ***paṭikūlamanasikāra pabba*** = section of way of discerning on (32) bodily parts through foulness nature (***paṭikūla***) 
1. ***navasivathikapabba***  =  section  of  way  of  discerning  on  (9)  kinds  of  corpses  through taking objects of foulness nature called ***asubhabhavanā***,  

should be read in both section of ***samatha*** practice and section of ***vipassanā*** practice,

**(V).2. *vedanānupassanā saṭipaṭṭhāna* (First stage)** 

***Pāli* *Quotation* (M-1-75)** 

How does .., ***bhikkhus*** .., the practising ***bhikkhu*** stay through discerning on feelings as feeling over and over? In this noble admonishment, ***bhikkhus***, the practising ***bhikkhu*** distinguishes  that  “agreeable  feeling  is  felt”  when  agreeable  feeling  which  varies  in  two kinds, bodily agreeable feeling and mentally agreeable feeling is felt. He distinguishes that “disagreeable feeling is felt” when disagreeable feeling which varies in two kinds bodily disagreeable feeling and mentally agreeable feeling, is felt. He distinguishes that “neutrality feeling is felt” when neutrality feeling which is neither disagreeable nor agreeable one, is felt. 

When  agreeable  feeling  which  concerns  with  sensual  pleasure  is  felt  (he) distinguishes that “agreeable feeling which concerns with sensual pleasure is felt”.  

When agreeable feeling which does not concerns with sensual pleasure is felt (he) distinguishes that “agreeable feeling which does not concerns with sensual pleasure is felt”.  

When  disagreeable  feeling  which  concerns  with  sensual  pleasure  is  felt  (he) distinguishes that “disagreeable feeling which concerns with sensual pleasure is felt”.  

When disagreeable feeling which does not concerns with sensual pleasure is felt (he) distinguishes that “disagreeable feeling which does not concerns with sensual pleasure is felt”.  

When neutrality feeling which is neither agreeable nor disagreeable one feeling which concerns  with  sensual  pleasure  is  felt  (he)  distinguishes  that  “neutrality  feeling  which concerns with sensual pleasure is felt”.  

When neutrality feeling which is neither agreeable nor disagreeable one feeling which does  not  concerns  with  sensual pleasure  is  felt  (he)  distinguishes  that  “neutrality  feeling which does not concerns with sensual pleasure is felt”.  (***M-1-75***) 

**(V).3. General knowledge relating to feeling *Pāli* *Quotation* (*Abhi*-A-2-251, M-A-1-279) PAGE-457** 

In those words, “***sukham vā vedanam vedayamāno*** = when agreeable feeling which varies in two kinds, bodily agreeable feeling and mentally agreeable feeling, is felt”, even babies  who  can  merely  sleep  on  one’s back perceive that  agreeable  feeling  is  felt  when agreeable feeling is felt during sucking milk. 

However the Exalted One did not preach that discourse with referring to mere that kind of perceiving. It is right. That kind of perceiving of babies with that nature 

1) can not abandon opinion of being; 
1) can not remove perception of being; 
1) can not accomplish as practice (= practice of both ***samatha*** and ***vipassanā***); 
1) can not accomplish as mindfulness foundation practice. 

If appropriate saying will be said, \_\_\_\_ this kind of distinguishment of the practising ***bhikkhu*** in such way that “when agreeable feeling is felt he distinguishes that agreeable feeling is felt”, actually, 

1) can abandon opinion of being; 
1) can remove perception of being; 
1) can accomplish as practice (=practice of both ***samatha*** and ***vipassanā***); 
1) can accomplish as mindfulness foundation practice. 

(It means ***vedanānupassanā saṭipaṭṭhāna***.) 

It is right. \_\_\_\_\_ this preaching \_\_\_\_\_ “***sukham vā vedanam vedayamāno sukham vedanam vedayāmīti pajānāti*** = the practising ***bhikkhu*** distinguishes that “agreeable feeling is  felt”  when  agreeable  feeling  which  varies  in  two  kinds,  bodily  agreeable  feeling  and mentally agreeable feeling is felt is preached by the Exalted One with referring to such kind of feeling of the person who distinguishes well in various ways that \_\_\_ 

1) who feels that feeling? 
1) whose feeling? 
1) why does the feeling arise? 

(It means those preachings were preached by the Exalted One with referring to such kind of feeling of a person who can solve these question tags through penetrative knowing and seeing with the help of experiential knowledge called ***paccakkha ñāṇa***.) Answers of those questions are as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

***Pāli* *Quotation* (*Abhi-A-2-252*) PAGE-458** 

Among those three kinds of questions \_\_\_\_\_ 

1) there is neither any being nor person who feels that feeling;  
1) it is not feeling of either any being or person; 
1) the feeling arises, due to presence of object on which feeling lies. 

The practising person, therefore, understands in this way. “Only the nature called feeling feels by taking object of causal ***dhamma*** called object which is depended factor of feelings, agreeable feeling etc; then it is only worldly usage as “I feel”, basing on arising of that feeling”, known in this way. It should be recognized this practising person who can discern with the help of insight in this way is the person who distinguishes that “agreeable feeling is felt.” It should be recognized the fact that it is similar to an anonymous ***Mahā Thera*** who stayed in Cittala Mountain Monastery. 

**(V).4. How feeling is distinguished clearly  *Pāli* *Quotation* (*Mūlaṭī*-2-156) (*Anuṭī*-2-157)** 

Above ***Quotation***s of ***Mūlaṭīkā*** and ***Anuṭīkā*** are explanations showing how feeling is distinguished clearly in the continuum of practising person who is performing the practice called ***vedanā nupassanā***. 

The essence of those explanations are as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

**PAGE-459** 

The way of feeling of practising person who distinguishes well and significantly is called  ***sampajānavediyana***  (clear  comprehension  on  feeling).  It  means  the  clear comprehension  on  feelings  as  they  really  are,  through  distinguishing  on  significance  of various feelings, such as agreeable feeling which concerns with sensual pleasure together with  objects  which  are  depending  factors  of  feelings;  agreeable  feeling  which  does  not concern  with  sensual  pleasure,  which  is  factor  of  deliverance  from  sensual  pleasure  (= ***nekkhammadhātu***), is called ***sampajāna***. 

Therefore the word, ***vatthuārammaṇā***, must be made ***bahubbīhisamāsa*** (conjugation) as  “***vatthuārammaṇam etissāti  vatthuārammaṇā***”.  It  means  feeling  is  the ***dhamma***  with depending factor of object. 

The practising person who will keep feeling in mind must comprehend on these 

1. depended base corporeality of feeling, 
1. object which is depended factor of feeling, as they really are. 

He has to discriminate those two kinds with insight. Only when he can discriminate in that way can he distinguish feeling as it really is during keeping it in mind. It is worldly usage only  that  “I  feel  agreeable  feeling”  etc,  through  depicting  of  oneself  as  it  is  the  usage previously before feeling can be distinguished with insight. The virtuous person who has got clear comprehension on feeling with three kinds of full understanding called ***pariññā*** not only knows but also says the worldly usage as “I feel agreeable feeling”. It is no need to say for practising person, who is still trying to distinguish feeling, who is taking three kinds of full understanding on feeling. It means it must be said through worldly usage of common people. (***Mūlaṭī*-2-156, *Anuṭī*-2-157**) 

**(V).5. An anonymous** ***Mahā* *Thero*** 

If  is  explained  continuously  an  example  of  ***Mahā  Thero***  who  stayed  I  ***Cittala*** Mountain Monastery in the commentary so as to be obvious how feeling is distinguished clearly in this section of feeling as follows. \_\_\_\_\_ 

***Pāli* *Quotation* (*Abhi*-A-2-251) PAGE-460** 

When ***Mahā Thera*** had got serious sick he tossed and turned from one side to another on the moribund bed through moaning, due to great pain. Young ***bikkhu*** asked that ***Mahā Thera*** that “***Bhante*** … where is painful in your continuum?” “***Āvuso*** there is not specific painful place; only feeling is experienced by taking object of depended factor of disagreeable feeling”, replied by ***Mahā Thero*** in this way. 

Because ***Mahā Thera*** was able to keep corporeality-mentality in mind up to the field of ultimate nature through breaking down each compactness of corporeality and mentality, he could not find painful place. If four great elements are scrutinized in the painful place, only corporeal units can be found. If those corporeal units can be analyzed up to the field of ultimate nature, pure corporeal ***dhamma*** can be found as ultimate element nature.  When insight  knowledge  reaches  into  the  field  of  ultimate  nature,  the  perception  of  being  is removed, resulting in inability to find painful place. It is because painful place can be found during the period before the perception of being is not removed. Furthermore those corporeal ***dhammas*** are only nature of ***dhammas*** which arise within very short instant temporarily in the midst of two kinds of absence i.e., absence before arising and absence after arising. Very short instant temporarily means only the life span of about picosecond. The practising person who knows and sees those corporeal ***dhammas*** which are arising and passing away with very swift rate in that much can not find hand, foot, head, waist, thigh, hips etc, inside the body, but continuity of ultimate nature of corporeal ***dhammas*** which is arising and passing away with very swift rate with the help of eye of wisdom. Any ***meditator*** who wants to discern feeling must also be a person who has reached into the field of ultimate nature as that ***Mahā Thero***. If painful place can be found, the insight has not reached into the field of ultimate nature,  resulting  in  inability  to  shine  light  of  non-self  comely.  ***Mahā  Thero***,  therefore, answered that “there is no specific painful place; only feeling is experienced by taking object of  depended  factor  of  disagreeable  feeling”.  Commentaries  specify  that  every  practising person  who  wants  to  keep  feeling  in  mind  or  every  person  who  wants  to  keep  mental ***dhammas*** which are led by feeling in mind, must accomplish to keep corporeal ***dhammas*** in mind generally in order to attain that kind of insight of ***Mahā Thera***. It is respectable rule which is deserving to follow by every person who cherishes truth. It will be obvious later. Please continues to read. 

**PAGE-461** 

At that time the young ***bhikkhu*** asked as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

“***Bhante*** … even if the insight has got penetratively reaching as much as this extent, it might be appropriate to tolerate that kind of pain.” 

“I will be tolerate … ***āvuso***”, replied by ***Mahā Thero***. 

At  that  time  the  young  ***bhikkhu***  asked  respectively  that  \_\_\_  “***Bhante***  …  only tolerance is excellent.” 

The ***Mahā Thero*** had got enough tolerance to pain without moaning after saying in that way. Then paralytic stroke brought forth bursting breast out up to the heart. (The heart remained left by bursting out of paralytic stroke). At that time ***Mahā Thero’s*** bowels were piling up on small couch and ***Mahā Thero*** said that … 

“***Āvuso*** … is it appropriate through having tolerance of this extent?” 

The young ***bhikkhu*** kept silence without saying anymore at that moment. 

Before bursting bowels out the ***Mahā Thero*** had got strong tolerance to great pain with predominant effort. Because predominance in effort gives rise to occur restlessness of mind  the  concentration  is  not  available  for  ***Mahā  Thero***  with  great  tolerance  called ***adhivāsanavīriya***. However after paralytic stroke caused to break abdomen and burst bowels out degree of pain feeling decreased consequently. Afterwards ***Mahā Thero*** adjusted to attain balanced effort and concentration so as not to beyond each other in respective functions and when  he  performed  ***vipassanā***  practice  systematically  he  had  reached  into  the  Fruit- Knowledge of ***Arahant*** with four kinds of Knowledge of Discrimination called ***paṭisambhidā ñāṇa***. At the end of reviewing impulsions which reflect acquired Path-Knowledge, Fruit- Knowledge and ***nibbāna*** the ***Mahā Thero*** had got final death of ***Arahant*** called ***parinibbāna cuti***  and  he  entered  into  the  eternal  peace  element  which  is  free  from  designation  of corporeality etc. (***Abhi*-A-2-251, M-A-279,280**) 

As one distinguishes that “agreeable feeling is felt” when agreeable feeling is felt, similarly one distinguishes that  “neutrality feeling which does not concern  with sensual desire is felt” when disagreeable feeling, neutrality feeling; agreeable feeling, disagreeable feeling, neutrality feeling which concern with sensual desire; agreeable feeling, disagreeable feeling, neutrality feeling which do not concern with sensual desire. (= Try to distinguish it.) (***Abhi*-A-2-252, M-A-1-280**) 

**(V).6. An example of way of discerning on disagreeable feeling** 

If the righteous ***meditator*** wants to discern mental ***dhammas*** which are existing in body-doer-cognitive-process,  including  touching-consciousness,  and  mind-door-cognitive process through discerning feeling as priority, he must keep corporeal ***dhammas*** in mind beforehand. 

**PAGE-462** 

1. Develop concentration step by step. 
1. Discern four great elements on any part of body where bodily disagreeable feeling arises seriously in the continuum of himself. For instance \_\_\_ let it be supposed a place on hips. Four great elements existing on hip must be discerned emphatically. (Any place means only specification on painful place for the purpose to discern before perception of being is removed. After breaking down each compactness of corporeality and reaching into the field of ultimate nature by insight there is no place.) 
1. Afterwards corporeal units can be found easily in the insight of ***meditator*** who is mastery in ***rūpaka mmaṭṭhāna***. If those corporeal units are grouped, there will be (5) kinds of corporeal units and (44) kinds of corporealities only. 

Five kinds of corporeal units are namely, body-decad, sex-decad, pure octad produced by mind, pure octad produced by temperature, pure octad produced by nutriment and there are (44) kinds of corporealities within those corporeal units in total. Qualitative numbers of corporeal units are only five but there are numerous corporeal units for each kind quantitatively. Qualitative and quantitative numbers of kinds of corporealities must also be understood in similar way. All those corporeal ***dhammas*** must be kept in mind as a whole. 

4. Both body-transparent-element which is inclusive in those (44) kinds of corporealities and life-continuum mind-clear-element  which arises by depending on heart-base must be kept in mind simultaneously. 
4. Any kind of elements called earth-element, fire-element, air-element which is the most predominant in its efficiency, which is occurring in either a corporeal unit or group of corporeal units which lies adjacent to body-transparent-element which has been kept in mind, must be taken as object. For instance \_\_\_\_\_ 
1) if the efficiency of earth-element is predominant, the nature of hardness must be taken as object; 
1) if the efficiency of fire-element is predominant, the nature of hotness must be taken as object; 
1) if the efficiency of air-element is predominant, the nature of pushing must be taken as object; 

In the side of corporeal unit with tactile object which is intended to be discerned must also be broken down each compactness of corporeality. The insight must be reached into the field of ultimate nature. 

6. When any kind of touching elements which is predominant in efficiency impinges into both  body-transparent-element  which  is  nearest  one  and  life-continuum  mind-clear- element simultaneously continuity of consciousness of body-door-cognitive process and mind-door-cognitive  process  will  arise  successively  but  separated  by  many  life- continuums. Afterwards those mental ***dhammas*** must be kept in mind through discerning on feeling as priority. 

If wise attention arises, impulsions will be wholesome ones; if unwise attention arises, impulsions will be unwholesome ones.  

Then (wholesome group) mental ***dhammas*** of mind-door-cognitive processes which are knowing on that touching-element as . . . 

1. corporeal ***dhamma***, 
1. ***anicca***, 

**PAGE-463** 

3. ***dukkha***, 
3. ***anatta***, 
3. ***asubha***,  must  also  be  kept  in  mind  through  discerning  on  feeling  as  priority. Afterwards  corporeality  –mentality  must  be  analyzed.  Corporeality-mentality  must  be discriminated  and  recognized.  Remaining  corporeality-mentality  must  also  be  kept  in mind continuously in similar way. Then causal ***dhammas*** of those corporeality-mentality which are kept in mind through discerning on feeling as priority are scrutinized and if those corporeality-mentality together with causal ***dhammas*** are discerned as objects of ***vipassanā***  practice,  the  Fruit-Knowledge  of  ***Arahant***  will  be  available  depending  on previous perfections called ***paramitta***, as above example of ***Mahā Thero*** who stayed in ***Cittala Mountain Monastery***. 

[To be careful \_\_\_\_\_ the nature of hotness and coldness is fire-element, corporeal ***dhamma*** while the feeling is mental ***dhamma***. If one discerns on the nature of hotness and coldness as feeling, his way of practice will be completely wrong.] 

**(V).7. Two kinds of meditation subjects** 

In the ***samatha*** stage there are (40) kinds of meditation subjects. In the ***vipassanā*** stage,  however,  there  are  only  two  kinds  of  meditation   subjects,  ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** (meditation  subject  of  corporeality)  and  ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna***  (meditation  subject  of mentality). Those two kinds of meditation subjects also known as … 

1. ***rūpa  pariggaha***  =  keeping  corporeality  in  mind  =  distinguishing  on  corporeality  by insight = the knowledge which is factor of keeping corporeality in mind; 
1. ***arūpa pariggaha*** = keeping mentality in mind = distinguishing on mentality by insight = the knowledge which is factor of keeping mentality in mind; 

***Pāli* *Quotation* (*Abhi*-*A-2-252, M-A-1-280) (M-ṭī-1-368)*** 

The  term,  ***arūpakammaṭṭhāna***,  means  keeping  mental  ***dhamma***  in  mind  or distinguishing mental ***dhamma*** by insight. It means taking into heart mentality-corporeality which are objects of ***vipassanā*** knowledge through discerning on mental ***dhamma*** as priority. Furthermore, taking into heart ***samatha*** or taking into heart object of ***samatha*** should be counted collectively in the ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna***. It is because in the ***Mahā saṭipaṭṭhāna Sutta*** etc., the Exalted one preached on taking into heart objects of ***samatha***, such as mindfulness of breathing,  in  the  ***kāyānupassanā  saṭipaṭṭhāna***.  In  this  case,  however,  the  Commentator Sayadaw who wants to show clearly on the fact “taking into heart only corporeal ***dhamma***, mental ***dhamma*** which are objects of ***vipassanā*** knowledge is worth desiring”, explains that those  ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna,  nāmakammaṭṭhāna***  also  known  as  ***rūpapariggaha, arūpapariggaha***.

**7(a). Two kinds of *rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** 

***Pāli* *Quotation* (*Abhi*-*A-2-252, M-A-1-280)*** 

When the Exalted One preached on ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** it was usually accomplished through preaching on four elements meditation (***catudhātuvavatthāna***) which distinguishes on four great elements by insight by means of  

1. either ***sankhepamanasikāra*** = brief way of taking into heart or 
1. ***vitthāra manasikāra*** = detailed way of taking into heart respectively.  

`      `**(*Abhi*-*A-2-252, M-A-1-280*)** 

The Exalted One preached on brief way of taking into heart on four elements in ***Mahā saṭipaṭṭhāna sutta*** **(*M-1-73*)** while detailed  way of taking into heart on four elements in ***Mahārāhulovāda sutta* (*M-2-84*)**, ***Dhātuvibhanga Sutta* (*M-3-283*)*, Mahā hatthipadopama Sutta* (*M-1-2-242*)** and ***Dhātuvibhanga* *Pāli* Text (*Abhi-2-84*)** etc., respectively. **(*Mūlaṭī*-*2- 157*)** 

According  to  specification  of  the  sub-commentator  Sayadaw  in  a  way  that “***catudhātuvavatthānam  kathesīti  etthāpi  “yebhuyyenā”  ti  padam  ānetvā  sambandhi tabbam***.” **(*M-ṭī-1-368*)**, it should be recognized this rule is also “general rule”. 

**7.(b). Three kinds of *nāmakammaṭṭhāna* *Pāli* *Quotation* (*Abhi-A-2-252, M-A-1-280*)** 

When the Exalted One preached ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*** it was accomplished by means of feeling generally. It will be explicit. \_\_\_\_\_ 

There are three ways of taking into heart in ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna***, viz, 

1. way of taking into heart through feeling, 
1. way of taking into heart through contact, 
1. way of taking into heart through consciousness, 

**PAGE-465** 

1. After keeping ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** in mind through either brief method or detailed method, for some practising ***meditators*** the contact (***phassa***), which arise by coming into contact with object called that corporeal ***dhamma***, which is the nature of impinging of mind and mental concomitants on object called corporeal ***dhamma***, is apparent. 
1. For some practising persons, the feeling (***vedanā***) which arises by experiencing with that object is apparent. 
1. For  some  practising  persons,  the  consciousness  (***viññāṇa***)  which  arises  by  taking discriminately on that object is apparent. 

**7.(c). After keeping *rūpakammaṭṭhāna* in mind** 

In this case commentaries explain on these words, “***pariggahite rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** = after keeping ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** in mind”, as additional words. Sub-commentator Sayadaw explains on the fact relating to that explanation as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

***Pāli* *Quotation* (*M*-*ṭī*-1-369)** 

Commentator Sayadaw explains these words, “after keeping ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** in mind”, with referring to way of taking into heart ***vipassanā*** (= way of taking into heart = keeping in mind = discriminating on corporeal and mental ***dhammas*** which are objects of ***vipassanā*** practice) through discerning on corporeal ***dhamma*** as priority. Way of taking into heart discerned objects of ***vipassanā*** knowledge through discerning 0on mental ***dhamma*** as priority, actually, is worth desiring for ***samathayānika*** person (= the person with vehicle of ***samatha***)  generally.  That  person  with  vehicle  of  ***samatha***  who  wants  to  take  into  heart discerned objects of ***vipassanā*** knowledge through discerning on mental ***dhamma*** as priority must  distinguish  and  keep  factors  of  absorption  called  ***jhānanga***  in  mind  previously. Afterwards \_\_\_ both remaining mental ***dhammas*** called  ***jhāna dhamma*** and miscellaneous sensuous mental ***dhammas*** called ***pakiṇṇaka sankhāra***; and  corporeal ***dhammas*** must also be kept in mind and distinguished by insight knowledge continuously. **(*M-ṭī-1-369*)** 

**7.(d). How the practising person performs improperly** 

The righteous practising person has to question himself that “am I the person with vehicle of ***samatha*** or person with vehicle of pure ***vipassanā***?” If he can answered that he is the  latter  person  he  has  to  keep  corporeality-mentality,  which  are  objects  of  ***vipassanā*** practice, in mind through discerning on corporeal ***dhamma*** as  priority. It is because way of keeping corporeality-mentality, which  are objects of ***vipassanā*** practice, in mind through discerning on mental ***dhamma*** as priority is worth desiring for only person with vehicle of ***samatha*** generally. It is very important rule which must be followed respectfully especially for those persons with vehicle of pure ***vipassanā***. 

**PAGE-466** 

During keeping corporeality-mentality in mind in that way corporeal ***dhammas*** must be kept in mind beforehand. When mental ***dhammas*** are kept in mind any way of keeping in mind which is clear and easy in one’s insight , among above three ways, can be performed as beginning. If the righteous ***meditator*** is the person with vehicle of ***samatha***, he can keep factors of absorption in mind as beginning. Now it will be presented on three ways of taking into  heart  ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna***  which  are  explained  in  commentaries  in  this  section  of ***vedanānupassanā*** ***saṭipaṭṭhāna*** in order to connect preceding opinion and succeeding ones correctly. 

**7.(e)1. The person with insight of apparent contact *Pāli* *Quotation* (*Abhi-A-2-252, M-A-1-280*)** 

=Among those three kinds, the contact (***phassa***) is apparent in the insight of such practising  person;  that  person  with  insight  of  apparent  contact  also  keeps  only ***phassapañcamaka dhamma*** (= ***dhammas*** with the contact as fifth factor) in mind through bearing in mind that “not only contact but the feeling which is capable of experiencing that object also arises together with contact; but the perception which is capable of making mental note on that object, also arises; but the volition, which is capable of urging on associating ***dhammas*** in order to reach onto that object, also arises; but the consciousness, which is capable of knowing discriminately on that object, also arises”. **(*Abhi-A-2-252, M-A-1-280*)** 

**7.(e)2. The person with insight of apparent feeling *Pāli* *Quotation* (*Abhi*-*A-2-252, M-A-1-280*)** 

The feeling (***vedanā***) is apparent in the insight of such practising person; that person with insight of apparent feeling also keeps only ***phassapañcamaka dhamma*** (= ***dhammas*** with the contact as fifth factor) in mind through bearing in mind that “not only feeling but the contact which is capable of coming into contact with that object also arises together with feeling; but the perception which is capable of making mental note on that object, also arises; but the volition, which is capable of urging on associating ***dhammas*** in order to reach onto that object, also arises; but the consciousness, which is capable of knowing discriminately on that object, also arises”. **(*Abhi-A-2-252, M-A-1-280*)** 

**PAGE-467** 

**7.(e)3.  The person with insight of apparent consciousness *Pāli* *Quotation* (*Abhi-A-2-252, M-A-1-280*)** 

- The consciousness (***viññāṇa***) is apparent in the insight of such practising person; 

that  person  with  insight  of  apparent  consciousness  also  keeps  only  ***phassapañ-camaka dhamma*** (= ***dhammas*** with the contact as fifth factor) in mind through being in mind that “not only consciousness (***viññāṇa***) but the contact (***phassa***) which is capable of coming into contact with that object, also arises; but the feeling which is capable of experiencing that object, also arises; but the perception (***saññā***) which is capable of making mental note on that object, also arises; but the volition which is capable of urging or associating ***dhammas*** in order to reach onto that object, also arises”. **(*Abhi-A-2-252, M-A-1-280*)** 

**7.(f) Showing presence of same *pariggaha* (=way of keeping in mind)** 

***phassapañcamakeyevāti  evasaddena  vuttesu  tīsupi  mukhesu  pariggahassa  sanānatan dasseti*. (*Mūlaṭī-2-157*)** 

=When the practising person keeps ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*** in mind through any way of three ways of keeping in mind, i.e., by means of contact, by means of feeling, by means of consciousness  the  term,  ***eva***  (=only),  which  consists  in  ***phassapañcamakayeva***,  shows “qualitative numbers of ultimate elements which are deserving to discern are the same as each  other”.  Therefore  the  practising  person  who  discerns  feeling  must  not  discern  pure feeling but all associating ***dhammas*** within every mind moment with the help of penetrative knowledge discriminately. It is a respectable rule which must be followed by every virtuous persons who cherish real ***dhammas***. (**See *M-ṭī-1-370***) 

***Pāli* *Quotation* (*M-ṭī-1-369*)** 

Among  three  kinds  of  ***dhammas***  called  contact,  feeling,  consciousness,  apparent occurrence of any ***dhamma*** in the ***meditator***’s insight depends on 

1. factors of perfections called ***pāramitta*** which had been cultivated in previous lives and 
1. factors of base-object etc, which are capable of benefiting so as to be apparent any kind of three ***dhammas***, contact or feeling or consciousness in present period. 

**PAGE-468** 

It should be recognized due to presence of those factors any one becomes apparent through way of taking into heart called ***ābhoga*** which arises just before keeping in mind previously. (***M-ṭī-1-369***) 

According to explanation of above sub-commentary it should be recognized the fact any kind of three ***dhammas***, contact etc., becomes apparent appropriately in accordance with one’s  way  of  taking  into  heart  which  arises  previous  cultivated  perfections,  benefiting efficiency of depended base-corporeality, object-corporeality coincide unitedly. 

For the practising person who has accomplished to keep mental ***dhammas*** in mind through discerning on feeling as priority especially, the cascade of ways of practices which must be continued to perform in order to attain the Knowledge of Analyzing  Mentality- Corporeality are instructed in commentaries as follows. 

**7.(g) *nāmarūpaparicchedañāṇa* (the Knowledge of Analyzing Mentality-Corporeality) *Pāli* *Quotation* (*Abhi-A-2-252, 253; M-A-1-281*)** 

When that practising ***bhikkhu*** scrutinizes in such way that “these ***phassapañcamaka dhammas***  arise  depending  on  which  dependence  base”,  he  knows  and  sees  that  these ***phassapañcamaka dhammas*** arise depending on base-corporealities. In this case, the term, base (***vatthu***), means not only pure eye-base, ear-base, nose-base, tongue-base, body-base, heart-base but also all kinds of corporeal ***dhammas*** called ***karajakāya***. 

With  referring  to  base-corporealities  called  those  ***karajakāya***  \_\_\_\_\_  the  Exalted  One preached that “this consciousness of mine depends on these ***kārajakāya***; it arises relating to these ***karajakāya*** in ***Sāmaññaphala Sutta* (*Di-1-72*)** and ***Mahāsakuludāyi Sutta*** **(*M-2-209*)**. The basic meaning of those ***karajakāya*** means four kinds of great elements and (24) kinds of derived corporealities in the aspect of ultimate nature. (Those are really (54) kinds, (44) kinds of corporealities etc., which arise through four origins called ***kamma-citta-utu-āhāra***. Please see tables of ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna***, **Volume I**.) 

In  this  place,  the  practising  person  sees  only  mentality-corporeality  through discerning as  

1. those bases called ***karajakāya*** are corporeal ***dhamma***, 
1. those ***dhammas*** called ***phassa pañcamaka*** are mental ***dhamma***. 

**PAGE-469** 

In these two kinds of mentality-corporeality \_\_\_\_\_ 

1. corporeal ***dhammas*** are corporeal aggregate called ***rūpakkhandhā***; 
1. mental  ***dhammas***  are  four  mental  aggregates  ***nāmakkhandhā***  (=  ***vedanākkhandhā***, ***saññākkhandhā, sankhārakkhandhā, viññāṇakkhandhā***). 

Thus there are only five aggregates. It is right. \_\_\_\_\_ 

1. There are no five aggregates free from two kinds of mentality-corporeality; 
1. there are no mentality-corporeality free from five aggregates. 

**7.(h).  *paccayapariggahañāṇa*  (Knowledge  of  Discerning  Cause  and  Condition)  \_\_\_ *vipassanā ñāṇa*** 

***Pāli* *Quotation* (*Abhi-A-2-253, M-A-1-281*)** 

When that practising person scrutinizes that “which causal ***dhammas*** are factors of arising of these five aggregates he knows and sees causal ***dhammas***, ignorance etc., with the help of eye of wisdom. (It will be explicit in Section of Dependent-Origination, Volume III.) 

After attaining that Knowledge of Discerning Cause and Condition that practising ***bhikkhu*** realizes in a way that these corporeality-mentality means only causal and resultant ***dhammas***; there is neither being nor person other than causes and results; those are only piles of causes and results called conditioned things. Afterwards he performs ***vipassanā*** practice through  discerning  on  mentality-corporeality  together  with  causal  ***dhammas***  as  ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***, alternately. (It will be explicit in Section of ***Vipassanā*** Practice, Volume V.) 

At one day at which the Fruit-Knowledge of ***Arahant*** is available through heartfelt desiring to the Path-Knowledge which are capable of penetrative knowing and seeing on Four Noble Truths successively, 

if the following favourable conditions, viz., 

1. ***utusappāya*** = favourable climate, 
1. ***puggala sappāya*** = favourable virtuous teacher and friend, 
1. ***bhojanasappāya*** = favourable nourishment,  
1. ***dhammas  savanasappāya***  =  availability  to  listen  favourable  ***dhamma***  preaching  are available, 

the Fruit-Knowledge of ***Arahant*** can be attained through reaching apex of ***vipassanā*** Knowledge upto the Path-Knowledge of ***Arahant*** within one sitting period. In this way the Exalted One had preached way of practice up to the Fruit-Knowledge of ***Arahant*** for three kinds of persons, viz, 

1. the person with insight of apparent contact, 
1. the person with insight of apparent feeling, 
1. the person with insight of apparent consciousness, (***Abhi-A-2-253, M-A-1-281***) 

**PAGE-470** 

According to explanations of above commentaries every virtuous person should like to recognized firmly the fact that the person who has the insight with apparent contact does not discern the contact only; the person who has the insight with apparent feeling does not discern the feeling only; person who has the insight with apparent consciousness does not discern the consciousness only. 

**(V).8. Way of grouping mindfulness foundations** 

Then it should be recognized as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

1. After mentality-corporeality are kept in mind through discerning on the feeling as priority and  causal  ***dhammas***  are  scrutinized,  if  ***vipassanā***  practice  is  performed  through generalizing on those mentality-corporeality together with causal  ***dhammas*** as ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***, it can be said ***vedanā-nupassanā saṭipaṭṭhāna*** is being developed. 
1. After mentality-corporeality are kept in mind through discerning on the consciousness as priority and causal ***dhammas*** are scrutinized, if ***vipassanā*** practice is performed through generalizing on those mentality-corporeality together with causal  ***dhammas*** as ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***, it can be said ***cittā-nupassanā saṭipaṭṭhāna*** is being developed. 
1. After mentality-corporeality are kept in mind through discerning on the contact as priority and  causal  ***dhammas***  are  scrutinized,  if  ***vipassanā***  practice  is  performed  through generalizing on those mentality-corporeality together with causal  ***dhammas*** as ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***, it can be said ***dhammā-nupassanā saṭipaṭṭhāna*** is being developed. 
4. After  mentality-corporeality  are  kept  in  mind  through  discerning  on  the  corporeal ***dhamma***  as  priority  and  causal  ***dhammas***  are  scrutinized,  if  ***vipassanā***  practice  is performed  through  generalizing  on  those  mentality-corporeality  together  with  causal  ***dhammas***  as ***anicca***,  ***dukkha***,  ***anatta***,  it  can be  said ***kāyā-nupassanā saṭipaṭṭhāna***  is being developed. 

It  should  be  recognized  these  rules  are  also  instructed  by  above  explanations  of commentaries.  It  will  be  continued  to  present  general  knowledge  relating  to  the  feeling (***vedanā***) according to commentaries as follows. \_\_\_\_\_ 

**PAGE-471** 

Among four kinds of mindfulness foundations (***saṭipaṭṭhāna***), in this preaching of the second one, ***vedanā-nupassanā saṭipaṭṭhāna***, the Exalted One preached ***arūpakammaṭṭhāna*** (=***nāmakammaṭṭhāna***) to keep mental ***dhammas*** in mind through discerning on the feeling as priority and beginning with the intention of easy understanding for the person with insight of apparent  feeling  especially.  If  the  preaching  is  performed  by  means  of  either  contact  or consciousness as priority and beginning, the ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*** will usually be unapparent; it usually appears as cloud of darkness. If it is said appropriately, because the practising person is the person with insight of apparent feeling, when the preaching was performed to keep mental ***dhammas*** in mind through discerning on the feeling as priority and beginning ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*** usually becomes apparent. It is because the phenomenon of arising of feeling  is  apparent  in  the  continuum  of  that  practising  person.  Detailed  account  will  be presented as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

Phenomena of arising of agreeable feeling, disagreeable feeling are apparent in the continuum of that person with insight of apparent feeling. The agreeable feeling arises at such time; at that time it arises through saying, that “it is blissful, it is blissful”; it arises through agitating,  oppressing,  spreading,  flowing  (=soaking)  as  the  butter,  which  is  strained  out hundred times, is tasted; as the oil which is refined hundred times, is applied; as the feeling hot and stuffy (because of sultry weather) is put out by pouring with thousand water pots. 

The disagreeable feeling arises at such time; at that time it arises through saying that “it  is  painful,  it  is  painful”;  it  arises  through  agitating,  oppressing,  spreading  flowing (=soaking), as very hot ploughshare is thrusted into the body; as melted copper liquid is poured on the body; as a flambeau is thrown into the forest with dry grasses and trees. Thus the arising of agreeable feeling or disagreeable feeling is apparent. (***Abhi-A-2-253, M-A-1- 281, 282***) 

The  next  kind,  neutrality  feeling  called  ***a-dukkhamasukha***,  which  is  neither disagreeable  nor  agreeable  feeling  is  difficult  to  be  shown;  it  is  not  apparent,  due  to occurrence as cloud of darkness. That neutrality feeling is a kind of feeling with middle state of nature (=with indifference nature) on the object by means of rejecting both presence and absence  of  pleasure  on  the  object  at  the  time  of  avoiding  of  agreeable  feeling  and disagreeable feeling (=by the time those feelings perish away after coming up to specified life span called ***uppāda-ṭhiti-bhanga***). For the parctising person who distinguish in  this way that neutrality feeling is apparent. The worldly simile is as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

A hunter follows a prey called deer. During running that game animal climbs on stone-slab which is found at midway. The hunter also follows trail of deer that climbs on stone-slab along with the route. It should be recognized the neutral feeling can be known in similar to the deer’s foot-print on stone-slab can be known by the hunter who understands that “deer climbs on stone-slab from this side; it goes down from stone-slab at this place; deer will go across on middle of stone-slab from this place” etc., although no foot-print can be seen on stone-slab, which is called ***migapada-valañjana naya*** (= the method of following on trail of deer) 

**PAGE-472** 

As deer’s foot-print is apparent at the place of climbing on stone-slab, the arising of agreeable feeling is apparent. As deer’s foot-print is apparent at the place of going down from stone-slab, the arising of disagreeable feeling is apparent. As deer’s foot-print on the stone- slab can be reasoned by knowledge in a way that “deer climbs on stone-slab from this side; it goes down from stone-slab at this place; deer will go across on the middle of stone-slab from this place”, that feeling called ***adukkhamasukha*** (= neutrality  feeling)  is apparent in the insight of practising person who distinguishes in such way that the neutrality feeling, which is neither disagreeable nor agreeable feeling, arises through rejecting both presence and absence of pleasure on the object at the time of avoiding of agreeable feeling and disagreeable feeling (=by  the  time  those  feelings  perish  away  after  coming  up  to  specified  life  span  called ***uppāda-ṭhiti-bhanga***). 

By using preaching methodology mentioned above when the Exalted One preached ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna***,  in  the  next  method,  ***vedanānupassanā***  etc.,  after  preaching  on ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna***, in the next method, after preaching on ***kāyānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna***, way of discerning on mentality was instructed by means of the feeling as priority after extracting the feeling from four mental aggregates. (***Abhi*-*A-2-253, 254, M-A-1-282***)* 

This  way  of preaching  methodology  can be  found  not  only  in ***Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna*** ***Vibhanga, Abhidhamma Vibhanga***, but also in ***Dīghanikāya***, 

1. ***Mahānidāna Sutta***,

In  those  two  kinds  of  ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna***  and  ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna***,  corporeal ***dhammas*** is apparent in continuum of such person; for that person, the Exalted One preached ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** by means of either brief way of taking into heart four great elements meditation or detailed  way of taking into heart four  great elements  meditation.  For such person,  the  ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna***  is  apparent;  for  that  person,  the  Exalted  One  preached ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna.*** When ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*** was preached it was usually accomplished after  instructing  on  ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna***  called  dependent  base  corporealities  which  were dependence of those mental ***dhammas*** and object-corporeality. Because ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*** is apparent in the continuum of heavenly beings the feeling was extracted and preached by means of ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna***. 

The rule which is found in above explanations of commentary is worth following respectfully for every virtuous person who cherish right course of practice. However the commentary  explains  on  the  fact  relating  to  omitting  of  way  of  discerning  on ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** in convening a Buddhist synod as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

***Pāli* Quotation (*Dī*-*A-2-316*)** 

As ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*** was preached through discerning on the feeling as priority after  ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna***  was  instructed  in  various  ***Suttas***,  ***Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna  Sutta***  etc., mentioned above, in this ***Sakkapañha Sutta*** also ***rūpakkamaṭṭhāna*** was preached beforehand and then ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*** was preached through extracting the feeling from four kinds of mental aggregates, as priority. In this ***Sakkapañha Sutta***, however, the Exalted One preached on brief way of ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** which was merely object of feeling. It will, therefore, be omitted to convene way of discerning on ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** which is very brief in the ***Pāli Text*** of ***Sakkapañha*** in the Buddhist synod. **(*Dī-A-2-316*)** 

**PAGE-474** 

***Pāli* Quotation (*Mūlaṭī*-*2-157*)** 

Among  ***Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna  Sutta***  etc.,  in  some  ***Suttas***  the  Exalted  One  preached ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*** by means of feeling, through extracting the feeling from four kinds of mental aggregates, as priority after ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** has been preached previously. 

In  some  ***suttas***  the  Exalted  One  preached  only  ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna***  by  means  of feeling, through extracting from 

1. group of mental ***dhammas*** or 
1. group of ***dhammas*** which has already been known by ***ñātapariññā*** (full understanding on objects) (= it means  groups of conditioned things called corporeality-mentality-cause- result), or 
1. group of corporeality-mentality separately. 

It should be recognized the fact in those ***Suttas*** in which only ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*** were  instructed  the  commentator  who  performs  ***sangaha  Aṭṭhakathā***  explains  on  the occurrence of accomplishment to preach ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** beforehand by the Exalted One, with  referring  to  both  kinds  of  ***rūpakammaṭṭhānas***,  i.e.,  in  such  ***Suttas  ñātapariññā***  (= Knowledge of Analyzing Mentality- Corporeality and Knowledge of Discerning Cause and Condition)  was  preached  previously,  in  those  ***Suttas***  the  ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna***  which  was inclusive in that ***ñātapariññā***; in such ***Suttas ñātapariññā*** was not preached, in those ***Suttas*** also the ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** was mere object of feeling and brief account, which was omitted to convene in the Buddhist synod. **(*Mūlaṭī*-*2-157*)** 

According to these explanations the virtuous practising person who wants to discern feeling must follow respectfully these two rules, i.e, 

1. ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** must has been kept in mind beforehand; 
2. he must not keep only the feeling in mind, but he has to discern all associating mental ***dhammas*** within the same mind moment together with the feeling. 

**PAGE-475** 

**(v).10. The next method, how the feeling is distinguished clearly** 

Those words,  “***sukham*** ***vedanamvedayāmīti pajānāti*** = (one) distinguishes clearly that  agreeable  feeling  is  experienced”,  means  due  to  lack  of  disagreeable  feeling,  while agreeable feeling is arising, one distinguishes clearly that “agreeable feeling is experienced”. Due to ability to distinguish clearly in that way, he distinguishes that6 every feeling is ***anicca dhamma*** which can perish away just after arising; 

1. is ***addhuva dhamma*** (not durable ***dhamma***); 
1. is ***vipariṇāma dhamma*** (alterable ***dhamma***) with two kinds of characters called static phase,  perishing  phase  (=  ageing,  death),  through  knowing  in  such  way  that  “such disagreeable feeling was present before arising of agreeable feeling, that disagreeable is absent through ***uppāda-ṭhiti-bhanga*** by the time agreeable feeling arises recently; and present arising agreeable feeling was also absent before arising. (It should be understood the fact even though agreeable was experienced pervious periods, that previous agreeable feeling and recent agreeable feeling are specific kinds.) 

Thus clear comprehension called ***sampajaña ñāṇa*** on that feeling arises. (***Abhi-A-2- 254, M-A-1-282,283***) 

**(V).11. Excerpt of *Dīghanakha Sutta*  *Pāli* Quotation (*M-2-168*)** 

***Aggivesana*** ….. while agreeable feeling is experiencing, neither disagreeable feeling nor neutral feeling is experienced; at that time only agreeable feeling is experienced. 

***Aggivesana*** ….. while disagreeable feeling is experiencing, neither agreeable feeling nor neutral feeling is experienced; at that time only disagreeable feeling is experienced. 

**PAGE-476** 

***Aggivesana*** ….. while neutral feeling is experiencing, neither agreeable feeling nor disagreeable feeling is experienced; at that time only neutral feeling is experienced. 

***Aggivessana*** … the agreeable feeling is also ***anicca dhamma*** only; only conditioned ***dhamma*** which is produced by coincidence of causal ***dhammas***; only resultant ***dhamma*** which  arises  depending  on  causal  ***dhammas***;  only  nature  of  destruction;  only  nature  of perishing away; only nature of breaking up; only nature of ceasing. 

***Aggivessana*** … the disagreeable feeling is also … R … only nature of ceasing. 

***Aggivessana*** … the neutral feeling is also … R … only nature of ceasing. 

***Aggivessana***  …  through  knowing  and  seeing  in  this  way  with  the  help  of  both ***vipassanā*** knowledge and Path-Knowledge, a well instructed Noble Disciple with learning knowledge and practical knowledge, in the next method,  my disciple who is Noble One disenchanted  with  agreeable  feeling,  disenchanted  with  disagreeable  feeling  also, disenchanted  with  neutral  feeling  called  ***adukkhamasukha  vedanā***.  As  disenchantment arises,  heartfelt  desire  is  dissipated;  As  heartfelt  desire  is  dissipated,  liberation  (from defilements) takes place. When liberation takes place reviewing knowledge which can reflect that “the mind is liberated from defilements” arises. 

He knows. “Rebirth is no more. The Noble Practice of Purity has been accomplished. What has to be done (to realize the Path) has been done. There is nothing more to do (for realization of the Path-Knowledge)”. **(M-2-167,168)** 

In  above  ***Dīghanakha  Sutta***  the  Exalted  One  preached  four  elements  meditation previously to ***Aggivessana***, before preaching on ***vedanākammaṭṭhāna*** mentioned above. (Please See M-2-167 etc.,) Afterwards that ***vedanākammaṭṭhāna*** must be fulfilled with the following factors : \_\_\_\_\_ 

1. Firstly corporeal ***dhammas*** must have been kept in mind up to the field of ultimate nature. 
1. Second he has to know really on  
1) inability to arise disagreeable feeling and neutral feeling during arising of agreeable feeling; 

**PAGE-477** 

2) inability to arise agreeable feeling and neutral feeling during arising of disagreeable feeling; 
2) inability to arise agreeable feeling and disagreeable feeling during arising of neutral feeling; 
3. Third, because those feelings are conditioned things ***dhammas*** which care arise in the presence of union of respective causal ***dhammas***, which are resultant ***dhammas*** called ***paṭicca samuppanna dhamma*** \_\_\_\_\_  
1) he has to discern in order to know how associating mental ***dhammas*** benefit through efficiency of relation of ***sahajāta*** (compatibility), ***aññamañña*** (mutuality), ***nissaya*** (dependence), ***atthi*** (presence), ***avigata*** (non-diŝappearance), as they really  are. (It means he has to discern not only feeling but also associating mental ***dhammas***.) 
1) he has to know the phenomena of both arising of the feeling together with mental ***dhammas***,  corporeal  ***dhammas***,  due  to  presence  of  respective  causal  ***dhammas***, ignorance, craving, clinging, formations, action and absolute cessation of resultant corporeality-mentality  with  non-reappearance  in  future,  which  is  called ***anuppādanirodha***, due to absolute cessation of those causal ***dhammas***, ignorance, craving,  clinging,  formations,  action  with  non-reappearance  in  future  at  the  Path (moment) of ***Arahant***, as they really are. 
4. Fourth, he has to know nature of ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta*** of those corporeality-mentality- cause-result,  including  feeling  until  reaching  into  the  Path-Knowledge  and  Fruit- Knowledge, as they really are. 

In this ***Dīghanakha Sutta*** called ***Vedanāpariggaha Sutta*** it shows the fact only when one can discern and keep in mind on conditioned things can he be designated as the person who knows the feeling, as it really is. This is the essence of words of above commentary. 

**(V) 12. How varieties of feeling are divided** 

When mental ***dhammas*** are kept in mind through discerning on the feeling as priority those mental ***dhammas*** occurring in both every consciousness which is free from cognitive process (***vīthimutta citta***) and every consciousness of cognitive processes must be kept in mind  thoroughly.  Feelings  of  consciousness  of  ***paṭisandhi***-life-continuum-death  are  fixed without variation. If one is human being who has got ***paṭisandhi*** with agreeable feeling, those consciousness  of  ***paṭisandhi***-life-continuum-death  occurring  throughout  life  are  agreeable feeling only. Numbers of mental ***dhammas*** may be (34) or (33) respectively, depending on association with or without knowledge. If the righteous ***meditator*** is the person who has got ***paṭisandhi*** with neutral feeling, those consciousness of ***paṭisandhi***-life-continuum-death are also neutral feeling only. Numbers of mental ***dhammas*** may be (33) or (32) respectively, depending on association with or without knowledge. 

Furthermore  during  keeping  consciousness  of  cognitive  processes  in  mind,  if  one wants to keep those mental ***dhammas*** in mind through discerning on the feeling as priority, the following specifications should be recognized. 

In five-doors-cognitive processes \_\_\_\_\_ 

1. In five-doors-adverting \_\_\_ it always associates with neutral feeling; it consists of (11) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. 
1. In seeing-consciousness \_\_\_ it always associates with neutrality feeling; it consists of (8) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. 

**PAGE-478** 

(Hearing-consciousness,  smelling-consciousness,  taking-consciousness,  are  also  in similar way. In touching-consciousness it associates with disagreeable feeling sometimes or agreeable feeling sometimes; numbers of mental ***dhammas*** are (8) kinds only.) 

3. In receiving-consciousness \_\_\_ it always associates with neutral feeling; it consists of 

   11) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. 
3. In investingating consciousness \_\_\_ it associates with agreeable feeling sometimes, it consists of (12) kinds of mental ***dhammas***;  it associates with neutral feeling sometimes, it consists of (11) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. 
3. In determining consciousness \_\_\_ it always associates with neutral feeling; it consists of 

   11) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. 
3. In each impulsion \_\_\_\_\_ 
1) if it is rooted in greed with agreeable feeling, 

`    `unprompted ones consist of (20) kinds, prompted ones consist of (22) kinds; if it is 

rooted in greed with neutral feeling, 

unprompted ones consist of (19) kinds, prompted ones consist of (21) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** respectively. 

2) if it is rooted in hatred, it always associates with disagreeable feeling. It consists of (18-20) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** etc. (See tables of ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna***) 
2) if it is rooted in delusion, it always associates with neutral feeling; it consists of (16) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. 
2) if  it  is  wholesome  impulsion  with  agreeable  feeling,  and  then  if  knowledge  also associates with it, there will be (34) kinds; 

if knowledge does not associate, there will be (33) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. 

if it is wholesome impulsion with neutral feeling, and then \_\_\_\_\_ 

if knowledge also associates with it, there will be (33) kinds; 

if knowledge does not associate, there will be (32) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. 

7. In each registering consciousness \_\_\_\_\_ 
1) if  it  is  rootless  unwholesome  consequence  investigating  registering,  it  always associates with neutral feeling; it consists of (11) kinds, 
1) if it is rootless wholesome consequence neutral investigating registering, it always associates with neutral feeling; it consists of (11) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. 
1) if it is rootless wholesome consequence agreeable investigating registering, it always associates with agreeable feeling; it consists of (12) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. 
1) if it is great consequence registering, sometimes it associates with agreeable feeling. if knowledge also associates with it, there will be (34) kinds of mental ***dhammas***; 

if knowledge does not associate with it, there will be (33) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. 

5) if it is great consequence registering, sometimes it associates with neutral feeling. 

if knowledge also associates with it, there will be (33) kinds of mental ***dhammas***; 

if knowledge does not associate with it, there will be (32) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. 

**PAGE-479** 

In the mind-door-cognitive process \_\_\_\_\_ 

\1.  In mind-door-adverting consciousness it always associates with neutral feeling; it consists of  (12)  kinds  of  mental  ***dhammas***.  (It  should  be  recognized  on  impulsions  and registerings in similar to impulsions and registerings mentioned above.) 

Those mental ***dhammas*** occurring in five-doors-cognitive processes and mind-door- cognitive processes can arise million million times within very short instant called twinkling of  an  eye  or  a  flash.  Numerous  kinds  of  feeling  are  consisting  within  many  cognitive processes. The virtuous ***meditator*** has to discern mental ***dhammas*** within each mind moment occurring in various cognitive processes through discerning on the feeling as priority after breaking down each compactness of mentality so as to reach ultimate nature penetratively. 

Because within each kind of cognitive process mentally agreeable feeling, mentally disagreeable feeling, neutral feeling, bodily agreeable feeling, bodily disagreeable feeling can associate with various mind moments accordingly \_\_\_\_\_ 

it can be said development of ***vedanānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna*** is not sufficient  

1. through  discerning  on  a  disagreeable  feeling  only  for  long  time  (numerous  minutes, hours) or 
1. through inability to discern thoroughly on various feelings which associate with mental ***dhammas*** of various mind moments which occur along with the fixed route of mind, or 
1. through inability to discern depended base corporealities and object-corporealities which are dependence of various mental ***dhammas*** together with the feeling. It can be said that kind of ***meditator*** is unable to develop ***vedanānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna*** systematically. 

**(V).13. *sāmisa sukha-dukkha-upekkhā vedanā*** 

Those feelings which depend on ***āmisa*** called (5) kinds of sensual objects, which depend on the house called sensual pleasure, which arise depending on (6) kinds of objects, viz, 

1. (6) kinds of agreeable feelings are called ***sāmisa sukkha vedanā***; 
1. (6) kinds of disagreeable feelings are called ***sāmisa dukkha vedanā***; 
1. (6) kinds of neutral feeling are called ***sāmisa upekkhā vedanā***. 

**(V).14. *nirāmisa sukha-dukha-upekkhā vedanā*** 

* ***nekkhammasitānīti vipassanā nissitāni*. (*M-A-4-186*)** 

After knowing the nature of ***anicca***; the nature of ***vipariṇāma*** which is the nature of capable  of  altering  through  ageing-death;  the  nature  of ***khayavirāga***  which  is  capable  of breaking up; the nature of ***khayanirodha*** which is capable of ceasing of (6) kinds of objects, visible-object etc., as they really are \_\_\_\_\_ 

**PAGE-480** 

in the continuum of practising person who knows and sees nature of ***anicca***, ***dukkha*, *vipariṇāma*** in such way that “previous experienced (6) kinds of objects and present arising (6) kinds of objects, those all kinds of objects (=corporeality-mentality) are only … 

1. ***anicca dhammas*** which always perish away just after arising; 
1. ***dukkha dhammas*** which are being oppressed by incessant phenomena of arising and perishing away; 
1. ***vipariṇāma dhammas*** which are capable of changing and altering through ageing-death, those feelings which arise during performing ***vipassanā*** discerning on (6) kinds of objects, viz., 
1. (6) kinds of agreeable feelings are called ***nirāmisa sukha vedanā***; 
1. (6) kinds of disagreeable feelings are called ***nirāmisa dhukkha vedanā***; 
1. (6) kinds of neutral feelings are called ***nirāmisa upekkhā vedanā***. 

Those ***nirāmisa*** feelings are also known as ***nekkhammasita vedanā*** which are factors of liberating from sensual desire. [Detailed account can be seen in ***saļāyatanavibhanga Sutta***, ***Vibhanga Vagga***, ***Uparipaṇṇāsa*** (***M-3-260,261,262***). It will be explicit later.) 

Ways of discerning and keeping causal ***dhammas*** in mind can be found section of Dependent-Origination,  Volume  III  and  ways  of  ***vipassanā***  discerning  can  be  found  in Section of ***Vipassanā*** Practice, Volume V. 

After  reading  general  knowledge  relating  to  ***vedanānupassanā  satipaṭṭhāna***  until present explanation, the virtuous practising person should like to ask question himself that “what is wrong?” 

Unless mentality-corporeality can be kept in mind through discerning on the feeling as  priority  up  to  the  field  of  ultimate  nature,  due  to  absence  of  sufficient  degree  of concentration called access and full concentration which are capable of benefiting for ability to reach up to the field of ultimate nature, the righteous person who follows the feeling through  discerning  on  the  body,  should  like  to  follow  rules  found  in  ***Pāli*  Texts**, commentaries, sub-commentaries respectfully in order to attain true ***dhammas***. 

**(V).15. Way of keeping in mind in brief** 

1. Develop concentration step by step. 
1. Keep corporeal ***dhammas*** in mind again. 
1. Among three ways of keeping ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*** in mind, through discerning on feeling as priority, he must keep mental ***dhammas*** in mind as shown in tables. Here it will be presented on one example. 

**PAGE-481** 

Let take object of the first row of table showing visible-object line wholesome group. If one wants to keep mental ***dhammas*** in mind through discerning on feeling as priority and then he wants to keep depended base-corporeality and object-corporeality again \_\_\_\_\_ 

1. In five-door-adverting consciousness- (11) kinds of ***citta + cetasika*** which are led by neutral  feeling  are  mental  ***dhammas***;  (54)  kinds  of  depended  base-corporealities, including heart-base and visible-object are corporeal ***dhammas***;

* In each life-continuum (34) kinds of ***citta + cetasika*** which are led by agreeable feeling are mental ***dhammas***; (54) kinds of depended base-corporealities, including heart-base and visible-object are corporeal ***dhammas***; (If refers to a mankind who has got ***patisandhi*** with three roots and agreeable feeling.)

As  shown  in  tables  of  ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna***  all  kinds  of  corporeal  and  mental ***dhammas*** shown in all (6) lines of both wholesome groups and unwholesome groups must be kept in mind thoroughly. Because those mental ***dhammas*** and corporeal ***dhammas*** are kept in mind through discerning on the feeling as priority, this way of mindfulness foundation can be called ***vedanānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna***. The First Stage will be successful in this way. 

During keeping these ***dhammas*** in mind \_\_\_ because mental ***dhammas*** and depended base-corporealities, object-corporealities are kept in mind through discerning on the feeling as priority \_\_\_\_\_ 

**PAGE-482** 

These kinds of feelings, VIZ,

1. mentally disagreeable feeling or  
1. neutral feeling or

1. bodily disagreeable feeling 

which is occurring in each mind moment within all (6) kinds of cognitive processes must be kept in mind in order to know discriminately. Any one of these five kinds of feelings is consisting in each mind moment. 

If one can keep mental ***dhammas***, corporeal ***dhammas*** in mind through discerning on the feeling as priority in that way, he has well accomplished to perform the first stage of ***vedanā nupassanā satipaṭṭhāna*** which had been preached by the Exalted One as follows \_\_\_\_\_ 

* ***sukkham vā vedanam vedayamāno*** “***sukham vedanam vedayāmī***” ***ti pajānāti***. (***M-1-75***) 

**(V). 16. *sāmisa sukha vedanā*** 

Those  desirable  living  and  non-living  various  sensual  bases  called  colour,  sound, smell, taste, touch, ***dhamma*** nature which are concentrated place of sensual craving are called ***kāmaguṇa*** (= sensual pleasure). Due to occurrence of similarity to house of sensual craving, those sensual pleasures are called ***geha*** (=house). It means due to presence of the meaning that the house where sensuous beings rely, dwell, take refuge, sensual pleasures are called ***geha*** (=house of sensual pleasure).  The  mentally  agreeable feeling, which arises through taking object of that sensual pleasure called ***geha***, which arises through adhering to that sensual pleasure (which is included in greed-wrong view group, greed-conceit group shown in  ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*)**,  is  called  ***gehasita  somanassa-vedanā.***  That  ***gehasitasomanassa- vedanā*** is called ***sāmisasukkhavedanā***. 

The practising person who wants to keep that ***sāmisa sukha vedanā*** in mind must keep in mind 

1. respective doors, eye-door-mind-door etc., and  
1. respective objects, desirable visible-object etc.,  

simultaneously and then he must keep in mind continuity of impulsions of cognitive process of  greed-wrong-view  group,  greed-conceit  group  which  arise  basing  on  unwise  attention through discerning on the feeling as priority. All (6) lines must be kept in mind through base- door system. Those mental ***dhammas*** which  arise by taking any one of (6) kinds of object appropriately must be kept in mind through ***sāmisasukhavedanā*** as priority so as to reach the field  of  ultimate  nature.  If  one  can  keep  all  kinds  of  mental ***dhammas***  in  mind  through discerning on ***sāmisa sukka vedanā*** as priority up to the field of ultimate nature, it can be said  he  knows  ***sāmisa  sukhavedanā***  discriminately.  He  should  not  forget  the  fact  after keeping mental ***dhammas*** in mind depended base-corporeality and object-corporeality must also be kept in mind. 

**PAGE-483** 

Because  that ***gehasita*** ***somanassa  vedanā***  is  a  kind  of  mentally  agreeable  feeling which arises together with craving on (6) kinds of desirable-objects that impinge on (6) doors accordingly,  there  are  (6)  kinds  of  objects,  resulting  in  (6)  varieties  of  those  ***gehasita somanassa vedanā***.  

***Pāli* Quotation (M-3-260)** 

In the continuum of mind of person who looks acquired visible-objects over and over, due  to  presence  of  availability  of  visible-objects  which  are  deserving  to  see  by  seeing- consciousness; which are deserving to search, please; which are capable of proliferating the mind; which are associating with the attachment called ***lokāmisa*** or in the continuum of mind of  person  who  recollects  previous  acquired  visible-objects,  which  had  been  ceased  and altered, over and over again, the mentally agreeable feeling arises consequently. This kind of mentally  agreeable  feeling  with  this  kind  of  nature  can  be  called  ***gehasita  somanas- savedanā***. (Audible-object etc., were also preached in similar way) 

Due to presence of (6) varieties of objects, those ***gehasita somanassavedanā*** called ***sāmisa  sukha  vedanā***  also  varied  in  (6)  kinds.  In  accordance  with  above ***Saļāyatanavibhanga  Sutta***,  those  ***sāmisa  sukhavedanā***  can  be  both  present  (6)  kinds  of objects  and  past  (6)  kinds  of  objects.  The  Supreme  Buddha  preached  on  those  ***gehasita somanassavedanā*** (=***sāmisa sukha  vedanā***)  as  the  feeling  which  is  not  worth  subsisting (***asevitabba***) in ***Sakkapañña Sutta*** etc.  

In this case, one should not misunderstand on the saying that “not worth subsisting” as “not worth ***vipassanā*** discerning. If it is not worth ***vipassanā*** discerning, the Exalted One did not instruct that those ***sāmisa sukha vedanā*** must be kept in mind clearly in this ***Mahā satipaṭṭhāna  Sutta***.  If  those  ***sāmisa  sukha  vedanā***  are  subsisted,  proliferated  frequently, brought  forth  to  arise  through  enjoying  sensual  pleasure,  unwholesome  ***dhammas***  will increase as tide but wholesome ***dhammas*** will decrease as the shape of waning of the moon. The Exalted One, therefore, preached that “***sāmisa sukha vedanā*** is not worth subsisting. However,  it  is  worth  discerning  as  ***vipassanā***  object  really.  After  keeping  mentality- corporeality in mind through discerning on those ***sāmisa sukha vedanā*** as priority causal ***dhammas***  must  be  scrutinized  and  then  those  mentality-corporeality,  including  causal ***dhammas***,  must  be  discerned  as  ***anicca***,  ***dukkha***,  ***anatta***  for  attainment  of  ***vipassanā*** knowledge.

**(V).17. How mentally agreeable feeling arises by taking past-objects *Pāli Quotation (M-A-4-186)*** 

There is a question that how mentally agreeable feeling arises by taking (6) kinds of objects which had been acquired in past period, even though the former arises by taking present (6) kinds of objects. The answer is as follows. \_\_\_\_\_ 

In  the  continuum  of  mind  of  person  who  remembers  the  past  objects  through following on present experiencing feeling in a way that “as I feel present desirable object I’ve felt these kinds of past objects in similar way”, very strong mentally agreeable feeling arises consequently. (***M-A-4-186***) 

**(V).18. *nirāmisa sukhavedanā*** 

***Pāli* *Quotation (M-3-260)*** 

- Among those kinds of feelings, which are (6) kinds of ***nekkhammasita somanassa*** 

***vedanā***?**  

After knowing on nature of impermanence, alteration, fading away and cessation of visible-object (audible-object, olfactory-object, sapid-object tactile-object, ***dhamma***-object) \_\_\_\_\_  in  the  continuum  of  mind  of  practising  person  who  discerns  this  visible  object (audible-object, olfactory-object, sapid-object, tactile-object, ***dhamma***-object) through taking into heart in such way that “there are various visible-objects of both previously experienced ones and recently occurring ones; those all kinds of visible-objects (audible-object, olfactory- object, sapid-object, tactile-object, ***dhamma***-object) are actually, 

1. only ***anicca dhammas*** which can perish away just after arising, 
1. only ***dukkha dhammas*** which are being oppressed by incessant phenomena of arising and perishing away, 
1. only ***vipariṇāma dhammas*** which can change and alter through ageing-death,  

the mentally agreeable feeling arises consequently. This kind of mentally agreeable feeling  is  called  ***nekkhammasita  somanassa  vedanā***.  It  is  also  known  as  ***nirāmisa*** ***sukhavedanā.*** Due to presence of (6) varieties of objects, ***nirāmisa vedanā*** also varied in (6) kinds. (***M-3-260***) 

**PAGE-485** 

***Pāli* *Quotation (M-A-4-186, Khu-1-67, Dhammapada)*** 

- As mentally agreeable feeling arises in the continuum of mind of the King who 

looks his wealth with luxury, similarly the mentally agreeable feeling arises in the continuum of mind of paractising ***bhikkhu*** who discerns perishing phase of conditioned things when sharp and brave ***vipassanā*** knowledge arises on the objects of all conditioned things through performing its function. That kind of mentally agreeable feeling is called ***nekkhammasita somanassa vedanā*** = ***nirāmisa sukha vedanā***.  

The Exalted One, therefore, preached these verses. 

In the continuum of mind of practising ***bhikkhu***; who stays in seclusion who has got very  calm  and  concentrated  mind,  due  to  presence  of  abandoned  defilements  through efficiency of both kinds of access and full concentration; who performs ***vipassanā*** practice through discerning on ***phenomena*** of arising and perishing away of corporeal and mental ***dhammas***,  five  aggregates  as  they  really  are,  the  satisfying  pleasingness  (***rati  dhamma***); which  is  different  from  enjoyment  of  human  and  heavenly  beings  with  dense  sensual pleasures;  which  is  called  ***vivekarati***,  ***nekkhammarati***  (=satisfying  pleasingness  with seclusion), due to depending on peace and quiet of absorption, Path, Fruit and ***nibbāna*** which are superior than normal charity, morality of layman devotees; which is called ***amānusī***; which is associating with ***vipassanā*** knowledge, arises calmly. 

The ***phanomena*** of arising and perishing away of clinging five aggregates from such such allotment of corporeality and mentality; bliss is available from allotment of corporeality and  mentality  which  are  discerned  in  that  way.  That  bliss  called  ***pītipāmojja***,  which  is satisfying on ***vipassanā*** practice, is the deathless nature called ***amata dhamma***, because it is true factor to reach ***nibbāna*** which is deathless nature for virtuous persons who know and see clearly  on  phenomena  of  arising  and  perishing  away  of  corporeality-mentality,  five aggregates. ( Translation is performed in accordance with explanations found in ***Mahāṭīkā*-*2- 431, M-ṭī-3-383***) 

Above kind of ***nekkhammasita somanassa vedanā*** = ***nirāmisa*** ***sukha vedanā*** refers to the agreeable feeling called ***nirāmisa sukha vedanā*** which reaches into apex condition. Although the righteous ***meditator*** does not reach into the ***vipassanā*** stage recently the Exalted One  instructed  to  keep  those  ***nirāmisa  vedanā***  in  mind  for  attainment  of  Knowledge  of Analyzing Mentality-corporeality in this section of ***vedanā nupassanā satipaṭṭhāna***. 

**PAGE-486** 

Therefore these kinds of mind-door-cognitive processes, 

1. which know as ***anicca***, 
1. which know as ***dukkha***, 
1. which know as ***anatta***, 
1. which know as ***asubha***, 

must be discerned and kept in mind thoroughly through taking objects of phenomena of impermanence, suffering, non-self, foulness of (6) kinds of objects, visible-object etc. During discerning in that way the practising person has to discern each and every object one by one through discerning on the mentally agreeable feeling as priority. 

In each impulsion and registering mind moments \_\_\_\_\_ 

1. if both kinds of knowledge and ***pīti*** associates with it, there are (34) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. 
1. if  only  ***pīti***,  but  not  knowledge,  associates  with  it,  there  are  (33)  kinds  of  mental ***dhammas***. 

Afterwards  depended  base-corporealities  of  those  mental  ***dhammas***  and  object- corporealities must also be discerned. If one can discern in that way, it can be said that when ***nirāmisa sukha vedanā*** is felt he distinguishes clearly as “***nirāmisa sukha vedanā*** is felt. 

**(V).19. *sāmisa dukkha vedanā* *Pāli Quotation (M-3-260, 261)*** 

- In  the  continuum  of  mind  of person  who  looks  non-acquired  (visible-objects,  audible- objects,  olfactory-objects,  sapid-objects,  tactile-objects)  ***dhamma***-objects,  over  and  over again,  due  to  absence  of  availability  of  (visible-objects…R…  tactile-objects)  ***dhamma***- objects,  
1. which are worth seeing by seeing-consciousness, 
1. which are worth hearing by hearing-consciousness, 
1. which are worth smelling by smelling-consciousness, 
1. which are worth tasting  by tasting-consciousness 
1. which are worth touching by touching-consciousness 
1. which are worth realizing by mind-consciousness; 

which are deserving to search, please; which are capable of proliferating the mind; which are capable of enjoying; which are associating with the attachment called ***lokāmisa*** or in the continuum of mind of person who recollects previous non-acquired (visible-objects …R… tactile-objects) ***dhamma***-objects, which had been ceased and altered, over and over again,  the  mentally  disagreeable  feeling  arises  consequently.  This  kind  of  mentally disagreeable  feeling  with  this  kind  of  nature  can be  called ***gehasita  domanassa  vedanā***. These are (6) kinds of ***gehasita domanassa vedanā***. (***M-3-260-261***) 

**PAGE-487** 

Those ***gehasita domanassa vedanā*** are also known as ***sāmisa dukkha vedanā*** which are not worth subsisting. The practising person who wants to keep those ***sāmisa dukkha vedanā*** in mind, can discern by 

1. taking any object of (6) kinds which are unavailable and bringing forth unhappiness or 
1. taking any object of (6) kinds which were unavailable and bringing forth unhappiness in previous period respectively. 

During discerning in that way both group of mental ***dhammas*** which are associating with  the  consciousness  rooted  in  hatred  and  depended  base-corporealities,  object- corporealities must be kept in mind through discerning on mentally disagreeable feeling as priority. If one can discern in that way, it can be said when ***sāmisa dukkha vedanā*** is felt he discriminates ***sāmisa dukkha vedanā*** clearly. 

**(V).20. How mentally disagreeable feeling arises by taking past objects *Pāli Quotation (M-A-4-186) (M-ṭī-3-383)*** 

There is a question that how mentally disagreeable feeling arises by taking (6) kinds of objects which had been acquired in past period, even though the former arises by taking (6) kinds of objects which are continuity present (***santati paccuppanna***). 

The answer is as follows. \_\_\_\_\_ 

In the continuum of mind of person who remembers the past desirable objects through following on present desirable object which is not acquired through having heartfelt desire in a way that “as I can not acquire desirable object now through having heartfelt desire, I had not  acquired  desirable  object  in  past  period  in  similar  way”,  very  strong  mentally disagreeable feeling arises consequently. (***M-A-4-186***) 

**(V).21. *nirāmisa dukkha vedanā* *Pāli* *Quotation (M-3-261)* PAGE-488** 

After knowing on nature of impermanence, alteration, fading away and cessation of visible-objects, \_\_\_\_\_ 

In  the  continuum  of  mind  of  practising  person  who  discerns  this  visible-object through  taking  into  heart  in  such  way  that  “there  are  various  visible-objects  of  both previously experienced ones and recently occurring ones; those all kinds of visible-objects are, actually, 

1. only ***anicca dhammas*** which can perish away just after arising, 
1. only ***dukkha dhammas*** which are being oppressed by incessant phenomena of arising and perishing away, 
1. only ***vipariṇāma dhammas*** which can change and alter through ageing-death” with the help of ***vipassanā*** knowledge, 

The  heartfelt  desire  to  attain  the  Fruit-Knowledge  of  ***Arahant***  which  is  called ***anuttara  vimokkha***  (incomparable  liberation  from  defilements),  due  to  occurrence  of supreme kind of liberation from defilements is brought forth in a way that “now Noble Ones are  approaching  and  staying  into  such  Fruit-Knowledge  of  ***Arahant***;  when  am  I  able  to approach and stay in that Fruit-Knowledge of ***Arahant***?” Thus the mentally disagreeable feeling  arises in the continuum of mind of practising person who brings forth arising of heartfelt  desire  on  ***anuttara  vimokkha  dhamma***,  due  to  presence  of  heartfelt  desire (adoration). This kind of disagreeable feeling is called ***nekkhammasita domanassa***. It is also known as ***niramisa dukkha vedanā***. (Five kinds of remaining objects, audible-object etc., were also preached in similar way.) (**M-3-261**) 

***Pāli* *Quotation (M-A-4-187)*** 

Various  thoughts  with  intention  to  attain  the  Fruit-Knowledge  of  ***Arahant***  arises through hearing indirectly from Noble Ones, the Exalted One etc. The wishing is also done with regarding to the Fruit-Knowledge of ***Arahant***. One’s mind is also observed in order to attain that Fruit-Knowledge of ***Arahant***. During performing ***samatha*** and ***vipassanā*** practices (6) kinds of desirable objects appear in (6) kinds of doors of a virtuous person who has heartfelt desire on the Fruit-Knowledge of ***Arahant*** appropriately. When desirable objects appear in (6) kinds of doors those (6) kinds of objects called conditioned things are discerned as  ***anicca***,  ***dukkha***,  ***anatta***  and  ***vipassanā***  knowledge  is  brought  forth  to  arise  through occurring very subtle ***piha dhamma*** which is heartfelt desire on the  Fruit-Knowledge of ***Arahant***. Although one endeavours, to reach the Fruit-Knowledge of ***Arahant*** with strenuous effort, he is unable to reach that goal. In the continuum of mind of practising person who is unable to reach the Fruit-Knowledge of ***Arahant*** in that way, the grief arises over and over through thinking in a way that \_\_\_\_\_ 

“even though I endeavour ***vipassanā*** practice with strenuous effort throughout this first half month, waxing of the moon; throughout this second half month, waning of the moon; throughout the whole month; throughout the whole year, it is unable to reach the Fruit- Knowledge of Arahant.” 

**PAGE-489** 

Those (6) kinds of mentally disagreeable feelings, which arise in the continuum of practising person with grief through copious flowing of tear-drops, like the most venerable ***Mahā  sīva  Mahā  Thero***  who  stayed  in  a  cave  near  village,  should  be  known  as ***nekkhammasita domanassa vedanā***. (***M-A-4-187***) 

***Pāli* *Quotation (M-ṭī-3-383) (Dī-ṭī-2-265)*** 

The  explanation  of  commentary  (***M-A-4-186***)  by  which  the  Fruit-Knowledge  of ***Arahant*** must be inferred with regarding to the term, ***anuttara vimokkha***, is accomplished through ***ukkaṭṭhaniddesa naya*** (preaching methodology which shows supreme kind) in order to instruct the supreme ***dhamma*** which is the factor of liberating from defilements. It should be recognized those mentally disagreeable feelings which arise through grieving with failure, while  ***samatha***  and  ***vipassanā***  practices  are  performing  with  heartfelt  desire  on  access absorption, full absorption, ***vipassanā*** absorption, lower kinds of Path-and Fruit-Knowledge, are also ***nekkhammasita domanassa vedanā*** only. 

**(V).22 The essence of above explanation** 

In this case, it does not mean that greed ***dhamma*** called ***pihā*** long for the Noble Fruit ***dhamma*** by taking object as directly. Even wholesome deeds without knowledge are also unable to take object of the supra-mundane ***dhamma*** directly. Actually those Supra-mundane ***dhammas*** are longed by means of inference in a way either through hearing indirectly that “Noble Fruit ***dhammas*** have these and these kinds of powers and attributes”, or through depending  on  knowledge  which  is  capable  of  recognizing  nature  of  supra-mundane ***dhammas***,  which  becomes  apparent  in  the  presence  of  efficiency  of  learning  scriptures, developing ***samatha*** and ***vipassanā*** practices. 

Names and terminology of very superior and subtle ***jhāna***, ***magga***, ***phala***, ***nibbāna dhammas*** also have very superior and subtle nature as those ***dhammas***. Worldly persons, therefore,  are  unable  to  long  for  unacquired,  unknown  ***jhāna***,  ***magga***,  ***phala***,  ***nibbāna dhamma*** by taking objects directly. They can long for those ***dhammas*** by means of inference through  taking  objects  of  names,  terminological  concepts  of  ***jhāna***  (absorption),  ***magga*** (Path), ***phala*** (Fruit), ***nibbāna*** (Eternal Peace). Now it is, therefore, explained on the arising of  longing  for  (=greed  ***dhamma***  called  ***pihā***)  the  supra-mundane  Noble  Fruit  ***dhamma*** through  hearing  indirectly  and  through  having  inference,  as  “the  longing  (=subtle  greed ***dhamma*** called ***pihā***) for the Supra-mundane Noble Fruit ***dhammas*** arises in the continuum of mind of worldly virtuous persons”. 

After apparent arising of longing for the Supra-mundane Noble Fruit ***dhammas***, even though ***vipassanā*** practice is performed with strenuous effort in order to attain those Noble Fruit ***dhammas***, the grief (=mentally disagreeable feeling) which arises over and over in the continuum of mind of practising person who fails to attain those Noble Fruit ***dhammas*** is called ***nekkhammasita domanassa vedanā***. 

**PAGE-490** 

Furthermore \_\_\_ the grief (= mentally disagreeable feeling) which arises by taking object of lost absorption ***dhammas***, due to falling back of acquired absorptions or due to failure to attain acquired absorptions again, is also known as ***nekkhammasita domanassa vedanā***. 

If  those ***nekkhammasita  domanassa  vedanā***  can be brought  forth  over  and  over, supporting factor of efficiency of relation of determinative dependence (***upanissaya paccaya***) can  be  attained,  resulting  in  improvement  of  ***samatha***  and  ***vipassanā***  practices.  Then wholesome  ***dhammas***  will  increase  many  times  over  but  decreased  in  unwholesome ***dhammas***.  The  Exalted  One,  therefore,  preached  that  those  ***nekkhammasita  domanassa vedanā*** are worth subsisting in ***Sakkapañha Sutta***. In this place the commentary showed an example of the Most Venerable ***Mahāsīva Mahā Thero***. 

**(v) 23 *Mahāsīva Mahā Thero(Dī-A-2-319, 322)*** 

The  Most  Venerable  ***Mahāsīva  Mahā  Thero***  taught  buddhist  scriptures  to  many thousands ***bhikkhus*** belonging to (18) religious sects. Thirty thousands ***bhikkhus*** had reached into the Noble Fruit of Arahant through abiding by that ***Mahā Thero***’s admonishment. An arahant of those disciples was thoughtful of his teacher on one day as follows:\_\_\_\_\_ 

“There are incomparable indebtedness of our teacher in myself. How can I see my teacher’s great indebtedness?”. 

When he bore in mind in this way he saw his teacher was still only worldly status (with the help of Super-psychic-knowledge) and then he came to his teacher by aerial journey with the power of Super-psychic knowledge after bearing in mind that\_\_\_\_\_ 

“Our teacher is the person who can be taken refuge in for others but not for himself really; I would like to advise that teacher.” 

He approached to his teacher who was staying at the place where he was practising on day time and he did filial duties towards his teacher and he sat down at suitable place near his teacher. ***Mahāsīva Mahā Thero*** sounded him out matter about coming towards. The disciple replied his teacher that he wanted to learn a rejoicing ***dhamma*** preaching. 

***Mahā Thero*** rejected that it was no spare time to teach a rejoicing ***dhamma*** preaching 

for him. **PAGE-491** 

Afterwards alternate arguments between teacher and disciple were as follows:\_\_\_\_\_ Disciple : Bhante….. please let me ask questions while you are standing on the corridor where you think about on alms-round village. 

Teacher  : Other ***bhikkhus*** usually ask questions on that corridor also, ***āvuso*** … sorry. Disciple : Bhante….. please let me ask questions on the midway before you reach alms round 

village. 

Teacher : Other ***bhikkhus*** usually ask questions on that midway also, ***āvuso*** … sorry. 

Disciple : Bhante….. let me please to ask questions at the place where you put on lower 

double robe neatly again. 

Teacher  : Other ***bhikkhus*** usually ask questions on that place also, ***āvuso*** … sorry. 

Disciple : Bhante….. please let me ask questions at the place where you put on upper double 

robe completely. 

Teacher  : Other ***bhikkhus*** usually ask questions on that place also, ***āvuso*** … sorry. 

Disciple : Bhante….. please let me ask questions at the place where you take bowl out from 

the bowl-bag. 

Teacher  : Other ***bhikkhus*** usually ask questions on that place also, ***āvuso*** … sorry. 

Disciple : Bhante….. please let me ask questions at the place where you take rest after going 

round for alms food, while you are drinking rice porridge. 

Teacher  : ***Mahā Theras*** who usually ask meaning of commentary come and remove their 

doubts at that time also, ***āvuso*** … sorry. 

Disciple : Bhante….. please let me ask questions when leave from the village after breakfast. Teacher  : Other ***bhikkhus*** usually ask questions on that time also. 

Disciple  :  Bhante…..  please  let  me  ask  questions  on  the  midway  during  return  back  to 

monastery. 

Teacher  : Other ***bhikkhus*** usually ask questions on that place. 

Disciple : Bhante….. please let me ask questions after lunch. 

Teacher  : Other ***bhikkhus*** usually ask questions on that place. 

Disciple : Bhante….. please let me ask questions at the place where you practise daytime 

duties. 

Teacher  : Other ***bhikkhus*** usually ask questions on that place. 

Disciple : Bhante….. please let me ask questions while you are washing legs on low wooden 

bedstead in order to get into monastery. 

Teacher  : Other ***bhikkhus*** usually ask questions on that place. 

**PAGE-492** 

Disciple : Bhante….. please let me ask questions while you are cleaning face. 

Teacher : Other ***bhikkhus*** usually ask questions on that time until arising of dawn, ***āvuso*** … 

sorry. 

Disciple : Bhante….. please let me ask questions when you come to clean face after taking 

***dantapoṇa*** (twig frayed at one end to clean the teeth) 

Teacher  : Other ***bhikkhus*** usually ask questions on that time also, ***āvuso*** … sorry. 

Disciple : Bhante….. please let me ask questions when you return back after brushing teeth 

with ***dantapoṇa***. 

Teacher  : Other ***bhikkhus*** usually ask questions on that time also, ***āvuso*** … sorry. 

Disciple : Bhante….. please let me ask questions when you sit down inside the monastery. 

Teacher  : Other ***bhikkhus*** usually ask questions on that time also, ***āvuso*** … sorry. 

Disciple : Bhante….. if it is so, is it worth giving an appropriate  time for meditation practice 

of  oneself  because  no  other  need  not  ask  questions  while  ***vipassanā***  practice, which is called wise attention (***yonisomanasikāra***), which is the factor for the sake  of  the  Path-Knowledge,  Fruit-Knowledge,  ***nibbāna***  etc.,  is  performing throughout the period with about two, three times changes of sitting deportment after cleaning face? Bhante … you will have got no spare time for even moribund moment. Bhante … you are similar to ornamental backdrop of a throne. You are dependence  of  others  but  not  yourself.  I’ve  no  desire  to  learn  any  rejoicing ***dhamma*** preaching from you. 

After the disciple asked in this way he returned back by aerial journey. 

The Most Venerable ***Mahāsīva Mahā Thero*** thought in a way that \_\_\_\_\_ 

“this ***bhikkhu*** has no obligation of learning scriptures really; however as an iron goad is  a  good  weapon  which  can  admonish  elephant,  he  comes  to  me  with  the  purpose  of admonishment similarly”. 

Then  he  thought  that  “now  it  is  impossible  to  leave  from  this  monastery  for  the purpose  of  obligation  of  practice;  when  dawn  arises  I  will  go”  and  he  taught  scriptures throughout daytime, early part of the night, after putting bowl and double robes besides him. At last part of the night (=dawn time) when a ***Mahā Thero*** left from ***Mahāsīva Mahā Thero*** after learning Pali Texts he left the monastery together with that ***Mahā Thero***. 

**PAGE-493** 

Those closest disciples who were waiting for learning scriptures thought that “our teacher left for any function to perform, such as relieving nature etc. 

Some ***bhikkhus*** thought ***Mahā Thero*** as a learner ***bhikkhu*** under the same teacher, due to seeing behind him hazily during arising of dawn. 

The Most Venerable ***Mahāsīva Mahā Thero*** thought highly of himself that \_\_\_\_\_ 

“it is no difficulty to attain the Fruit of ***Arahant*** for me, I will return back within two or three days after reaching into the Noble Fruit of ***Arahant*** really”. 

He left from monastery without informing closest disciples on 13[^1]h waxing of the moon, Wazo, the fourth month of the year. He went to a cave near village and he got on corridor. Although he performed ***vipassanā*** practice with strenuous effort he was unable to achieve the Fruit-Knowledge of ***Arahant*** on that day. He thought in a way that “I’ve reached this place by taking into heart in a way that the Fruit of ***Arahant*** will be accomplished within two or three days; however it is unable to reach now” on the full moon day of Wazo. He went into monsoon retreat and he sojourned during the Buddhist lent at that cave, near village with regarding on three months as three days through exerting all-out effort and thinking that “the Noble Fruit of ***Arahant*** will be known surely on the full moon day of Thadingyut: the seven month  of  the  year.”  Even  though  he  performed  ***vipassanā***  practice  with  heart  and  soul throughout three months, he was unable to accomplish to attain the Noble Fruit of ***Arahant***. 

On  the  full  moon  day  of  thadingyut,  ***mahāpavāraṇā***\*  day,  the  Most  Venerable ***Mahāsīva Mahā Thero*** thought that \_\_\_\_\_ “I’ve arrived this place with the purpose to attain the Noble Fruit of ***Arahant*** within two or three days. Even though three months for rains retreat  had  been  passed  it  is  unable  to  accomplish  the  Noble  Fruit  of  ***Arahant***.  My companions  in  residence,  who  are  performing  ***sāsanabrahmacariya***  called  training  of morality, training of concentration, training of wisdom, and ***maggabrahmacariya*** called the Noble  Path-Knowledge,  reach  into  the  Fruit-Knowledge  of  ***Arahant***  and  now  they  will participate celebration called ***visuddhimahā*** ***pavāraṇā\**** ”.  

\*ceremony held at the end of the Buddhist lent where a monk has to ask other monks to reprimand him for any sin he may have committed. 

***Mahāsīva Mahā Thero*** wept tearfully through thinking in that way. Then he resolved 

After resolving in this way he put the couch away. 

The  next  rain  retreat  reached  once  again  but  the  Noble  Fruit  of  ***Arahant***  was unaccomplished. He always wept on every full moon day of Thadingyut called ***pavāraṇā*** day throughout (29) rain retreats called ***vassa***. 

Due to absence of washing with water for long time, ***Mahā Thero’s*** legs became crack. Children of villagers stitched cracking sole of foot with thorns. When those children made fun each other they said “may my legs be crack like ***Mahāsīva Mahā Thero’s*** legs.” 

***Mahā Thero*** has practised with strenuous effort throughout (30) years for attainment of the Noble Fruit of ***Arahant*** and on 30th ***pavaraṇā*** day he stood by leaning against wooden 

backdrop of a throne and thought as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

“Now I’ve reached into (30) years for performing obligations of ***bhikkhu*** but it is unable to reach the Noble Fruit of ***Arahant***. Actually, neither Noble Path nor Noble Fruit is available in present life of myself. I’ve no opportunity to participate celebration of ***pavāraṇā*** together with companions in residence.” 

During thinking in that way the grief, disagreeable feeling arose apparently in him and shedded tears copiously. 

At that time a female heavenly being who was also crying stood at the place moderate far from ***Mahā Thero***. 

“Who is crying here?” Asked by ***Mahā Thero***. 

“Venerable Sir … I’m a female heavenly being”, replied by her.  

“Why are you crying? asked by ***Mahā Thero*** again.  

Female heavenly being replied that “Venerable Sir … the crying person can bring forth the Noble Path and Fruit. Venerable Sir … if either one or two Noble Path and Fruit are available by crying for me, I would like to cry in this way”. 

After replying by that female heavenly being in this way ***Mahāsīva Mahā Thero*** thought as follows:\_\_\_\_\_ 

* ***Arahants*** usually ask each other to reprimand, if any one sees, or hears, has doubt relating to any misdeed one may have committed. 

“Oh! ***Mahāsīva*** … even heavenly beings make fun together with you. Is it suitable to cry for you in this way? 

**PAGE-495** 

After  arising  of  the  knowledge  of  dreadfulness  called  ***samvegañāṇa***  when  he developed ***vipassanā*** knowledge in cascade of advancement of knowledge successively the Noble Fruit of ***Arahant*** was accomplished by experiential knowledge. 

That ***Mahā Thero*** who had become ***Arahatship*** thought that “now I will take rest by reclining deportment” and set small couch after cleaning inside monastery. Afterwards, he filled with water in the pot putting in front of stairway at the base of staircase and sat down on the low wooden bedstead after thinking that “ it is good time to clean legs.” 

When that Venerable ***Mahāsīva Maha Thero’s*** closest disciples bore in mind that “our teacher who went away for performing obligations of ***bhikkhu*** reached into (30) years now; is he able or unable to accomplished the Supra-mundane ***dhammas***?” and then they saw that he was sitting in order to clean legs after reaching into the Noble Fruit of ***Arahant***. They thought that “While closest disciples, like us, are still alive recently, it is not suitable to clean his legs by himself; I have to clean our teacher’s legs”, and those thirty thousands ***Arahants*** approached towards ***Mahāsīva Mahā Thero*** by aerial journey. 

After they bowed as a mark of obeisance and asked that  

“the Most Venerable ***bhante*** … we would like to wash your legs”. 

“***Āvuso*** … it doesn’t matter. My legs were lacking of washing any more about (30) years. I will wash myself”, said by ***Mahā Thero***. 

When  the  King  of  heavenly  beings  called  ***Sakka***  bore  in  mind  that  “the  Most Venerable ***Mahāsīva Mahā Thero*** has reached well into the Noble Fruit of ***Arahant*** now. Those thirty thousands closest disciples are not worth washing his legs, really. While layman devotee, like me, is still existing, it is not suitable to clean his legs by himself. I have to clean his legs just now”. After deciding in this way, the King ***Sakka*** and his queen, ***Sujā*** appeared spontaneously at the proximity of ***sanghā***. 

That King ***Sakka*** made opportunity to approach ***Mahāsīva Mahā Thero*** by leading of queen ***Sujā*** in front of him and asking ***sanghā*** that “please ***bhante*** … let us give way to pass, she is lady”, and they bowed as a mark of obeisance. After squatting in front of ***Mahā Thero*** he asked that “the Most Venerable ***bhante*** … I would like to clean your legs.” 

At that time ***Mahā Thero*** replied that “my devotee King ***Sakka*** … it doesn’t matter. My legs were lacking of washing any more about (30) years. Human bodie’s scent has got originally loathsome nature only for heavenly beings. Even though those heavenly beings who exist about (100) ***yojana*** far from human beings usually think human bodie’s scent as putrid corpse hanging on neck. I will wash myself. 

**PAGE-496** 

“***Bhante*** … scent of your body is, actually, not apparent. The fragrance of your virtue is far and away the best fragrance which is spreading up to the Supreme plane. ***Bhante*** … there is no fragrance better than fragrance of virtue. 

Due to spreading of fragrance of virtue yourself, I arrive here”, asked by the King ***Sakka***. After  asking  in  this  way  he  massaged  lightly  sole  of  ***Mahā  Thero’s***  legs.  Legs  became delicate like babie’s legs. Then the King ***Sakka*** bowed as a mark of obeisance and returned back to heavenly world. (***Dī*-*A-2-319***) This is out and away the best efficiency of meditation practice which is very respectable and competitive among all kinds of efficiency of great gentlemen. 

**V.24. Way of discerning on *nirāmisa dukkha vedanā*** 

Even though (6) kinds of objects, visible-object etc., in other words, (5) kinds of clinging  aggregates are discerned as objects of ***vipassanā*** practice, if  grief arises, due to incapable  of  reaching  into  the  Path-Knowledge  and  Fruit-Knowledge  which  are  desired earnestly, both mental ***dhammas*** which are led by those mentally disagreeable feelings and depended base-corporeality object-corporealities must be kept in mind through and through. If  (6)  kinds  of  objects  are  discerned  separately,  one  by  one,  there  will  be  (6)  kinds  of ***nirāmisa dukkha vedanā***.

When visible-object is seen by seeing-consciousness, due to presence of association with unwholesome ***dhamma*** which is  factor of occurrence of stupid one, the ***aññāṇupekkhā*** (= neutral feeling with nescience) which arises in the continuum of mind of stupid person; who is indecisive one, due to nescience on prosperity of himself and others; who can bring forth  numerous  defilements;  who  does  not  conquer  demarcation  of  defilement  through demarcation of the Noble Path; who does not conquer consequence of ***paṭisandhi***, (due to inability  to  attain  the  Noble  Path  which  is  capable  of  prohibiting  so  as  not  to  arise consequence  called  ***paṭisandhi***);  who  never  discern  on  visible-object  as  disadvantageous ***dhamma*** called ***vipariṇāma*** ***dhamma*** (alterable ***dhamma***); who never discern on delusive ***dhamma***  (***sammoha***  ***dhamma***)  as  disadvantages  called  ***anicca***,  ***dukkha***,  ***viparināma*** ***dhamma***; who is lacking both learning knowledge and practical knowledge; who is blind eye of  wisdom  on  ultimate  nature;  can  not  overcome  visible-object,  in  the  next  method, defilements which arise depending on visible-object. That neutral feeling is, therefore, called ***gehasita*** ***upekkhā*. (*M-3-261*)** 

**PAGE-497** 

Audible-object,  olfactory-object,  sapid-object,  tactile-object,  ***dhamma***-object  were also preached in similar way. There are (6) kind of ***gehasita upekkhā***. Thus when desirable objects appear on (6) doors, as a fly that perches on solidified lump of molasses (jaggery, sugar),  due  to  inability  to  overcome  objects,  visible-object  etc.,  in  the  next  method, defilements which arise depending on visible-object etc., it is neutral feeling, which arise through strong attachment on objects, visible-object etc., which depends on sensual desire. (***Dī-A-2-323, M-A-4-187***) 

***Pāli Quotation (M-ṭī-3-384)*** 

Six kinds of objects, visible-object etc., are, indeed, ***anicca-dukkha-anatta-a-subha dhammas***. The nature of nescience on real phenomena of ***anicca, dukkha, anatta, a-subha*** of those (6) kinds of objects, is ***aññāṇa***. The basic meaning of ***aññāṇa*** is delusion called ***moha***. The neutral feeling which arises together with delusion called that ***aññāṇa*** is designated as ***aññāṇupekkhā***. That ***aññāṇupekkhā*** never discern on (6) kinds of objects called conditioned things  as  ***anicca-kukkha-anatta-a-subha***  but  it  discerns  as  ***nicca-sukha-atta-subha***.  That way of discerning is called ***a-samapekkhana*** (= impertinent discerning). That ***aññāṇupekkhā*** is also known as ***gehasita upekkhā***. 

However, there is another kind of neutral feeling which associates with delusion as consciousness rooted in delusion and then the Sub-Commentator Sayadaw of ***Mahāvagga*** explains on ***aññāṇupekkhā*** which is worth desiring in this case as follows. 

***Pāli Quotation (Dī-ṭī-2-268)*** 

Among (6) kinds of objects, when any kind of object appears in respective door, the delusion which is nescience on real nature of ***anicca-dukkha-anatta-a-subha*** of that object is not apparent but the nature of neutrality called ***asamapekkhana*** (= impertinent discerning) on the object as ***nicca, sukha, atta, subha*** is predominant. 

In  this  section,  especially  discerning  on  desirable  object  as  ***subha***  (=  comely  object)  is apparent. Because the nature of nescience on real nature of ***anicca, dukkha, anatta, a-subha*** of object is not apparent, in this case, the neutral feeling which associates with greed, which arise  through  ***asamapekkhana***  (impertinent  discerning)  is  worth  desiring  as  ***gehasita upekkhā***. (***Dī-ṭī-2-268***)* 

As mentioned in tables of ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna***, Greed-group mental ***dhammas*** must be kept in mind through discerning on that ***gehasita upekkhā vedanā*** (= ***sāmisa upekkhā vedanā***) as priority after respective desirable comely object and each door are kept in mind simultaneously. Afterwards depended base corporealities and object-corporealities must also be kept in mind continuously. If those corporeality-mentality can be kept in mind through and through, it can be said when ***sāmia upekkhā*** is felt (he) distinguished as ***sāmisa upekkhā vedanā*** is felt clearly.

After knowing on nature of impermanence, alteration, fading away and cessation of visible-objects, \_\_\_\_\_ 

In  the  continuum  of  mind  of  practising  person  who  discerns  this  visible-object through  taking  into  heart  in  such  way  that  “there  are  various  visible-objects  of  both previously experienced ones and recently occurring ones; those all kinds of visible-objects are, actually, 

4. only ***anicca dhammas*** which can perish away just after arising, 
4. only ***dukkha dhammas*** which are being oppressed by incessant phenomena of arising and perishing away, 
4. only ***vipariṇāma dhammas*** which can change and alter through ageing-death” with the help of ***vipassanā*** knowledge, 

the  neutrality  (***upekkhā***)  which  is  capable  of  looking  on  conditioned  things unconcernedly arise. [In this case, both kinds of two mental concomitants, ***upekkhā vedanā*** (neutral feeling) and ***tatramajjhattata*** (equanimity) are meant as neutrality (***upekkhā***). (***Dī-A- 2-32***)] There is a kind of neutrality with such nature. That neutrality can overcome visible- object, in other words, defilements which arise depending on visible-object. That kind of neutrality is, therefore, worth designating as ***nekkhammasita*** ***upekkhā***. (***M-3-261,262***) 

Audible-object, olfactory-object, sapid-object, tactile-object, ***dhamma***-object are also preached in similar way. There are (6) kinds of ***nekkhammasita upekkhā***.

1. these (6) kinds of ***nekkhammasita upekkhā vedanā*** which are associating with ***vipassanā*** knowledge can arise in the continuum of mind of practising person who does not sin against on (6) kinds of undesirable-objects through anger (= who is performing ***vipassanā*** practice by three general characters so as not to sin against with anger); 
1. These  (6)  kinds  of  ***nekkhammasita  upekkhā  vedanā***  which  are  associating  with ***vipassanā*** knowledge can arise in the continuum of mind of practising person who lacks vacillation, due to knowing and seeing on the nature of ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta*** of those desirable  objects,  undesirable  objects,  moderate  desirable  objects  which  are  called ***asamapekkhana*** (= objects for impertinent discerning). 

**(V).27. *asamapekkhana*** 

In the commentary of ***Mahāvagga, Dīghanikāya*** **page 323**, it is found this word as “***asamapekkhanena”***.  In  the  sub-commentary  of  that  ***Mahāvagga***  that  term, ***asamapekkhanena***, is explained as follows. 

***Pali Quotation* (*M-ṭī-2-268*)** 

In  the  commentary  of  ***Uparipaṇṇāsa***  (***M-A-4-187***)  and  sub-commentary  of ***Uparipaṇṇāsa*** (***M-ṭī-3-384***), however that term is found as ‘***asamapekkhane***’ as shown in above. Although there are two varieties of terms, ***asamapekkhanena*** and ***asamapekkhane***, the basic meaning is correct. Essence of those commentaries and sub-commentaries is as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

Due to inability to lead through wise-attention on object as ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***, ***asubha***; due to incapable of taking into heart real nature of ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***, ***asuhba*** of object properly; due to presence of impertinent discerning on object as ***nicca***, ***sukha, atta***, ***subha***, when desirable object is experienced foolish worldly person without eye of wisdom on  ultimate  nature  usually  attaches  on  that  object  with  lust;  when  undersirable  object  is experienced he usually sins against it with anger, he will usually disappointed, sorrowful, weeping and wailing in grief. Similarly \_\_\_ due to lack of eye of wisdom on ultimate nature of three kinds of objects i.e, desirable object, undesirable object, moderate desirable object, when those (6) kinds of objects impinge on respective doors appropriately he usually sees on those objects as ***nicca***, ***sukha***, ***atta***, ***subha*** impertinently, resulting in having wrong knowing. He can, therefore, be designated as indecisive person. Therefore those (6) kinds of objects with three varieties called desirable object, undesirable object, moderate desirable object are objects which are deserving to see as ***nicca***, ***sukha***, ***atta***, ***subha*** impertinently for foolish worldly person who is lacking eye of wisdom on ultimate nature. The wise and virtuous person,  however,  knows  and  sees  those  (6)  kinds  of  objects  with  three  varieties  called desirable object, undesirable object, moderate desirable object as ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***, ***a- subha*** properly and penetratively without bewilderment as they really are. It means these (6) kinds of ***nekkhammasita upekkhā vedanā*** can arise in the continuum of mind of practising person who does not bewilder with delusion in that way. 

**(V).28. Way of discerning on *nekkhammasita upekkhā vedanā* PAGE-500** 

That ***nekkhammasita upekkhāvedanā*** is also known as ***nirāmisa upekkhāvedanā***. After taking each object of those (6) kind of objects, visible-object etc., \_\_\_\_\_ 

1) the  virtuous  practising  person  must  discern  as  ***anicca***  through  taking  object  of ***phenomenon***  of  arising  and  perishing  away.  Continuity  of  impulsions  of  mind-door- cognitive process with ***vipassanā*** knowledge, which are realizing as ***anicca***, will arise consequently. Those mental ***dhammas*** consisting in each mind moment of mind-door- cognitive process must be kept in mind through discerning on the feeling as priority. If mental ***dhammas*** are kept in mind through discerning on mentally agreeable feeling as priority,  it  can  be  said  ***nirāmisa  sukhavedanā***  is  realized  as  it  really  is;  if  mental ***dhammas*** are kept in mind through discerning on neutral feeling as priority, it can be said ***nirāmisa upekkhāvedanā*** is realized as it really is. 
2) Afterwards,  depended  base-corporealities  of  those  mental  ***dhammas***  and  object- corporealities  must  also  be  kept  in  mind  continuously.  (Way  of  discerning  has  been presented previously.) 

**(V).29.** ***nekkhammasitavedanā = sevitabba vedanā*** 

Above kinds of ***nirāmisa sukhavedanā, nirāmisa dukkha vedanā, nirāmisa upekkhā vedanā*** which are also designated as ***nekkhammasita vedanā*** are out and out the highest status. Those are very difficult feelings to be arisen in the continuum of mind of ***meditators*** who do not reach into the field of ultimate nature by insight knowledge. The Exalted One preached  on  those  ***nekkhammasita  vedanā***  through  the  preaching  methodology  called ***ukkaṭṭhā  niddesa  naya***  (showing  on  the  best  ones).  Those  ***nekkhammasita  vedanā***  are deserving to be subsisted for every virtuous person who has heartfelt desire on ***nibbāna.*** Those kinds of ***nekkhammasita vedanā***, in other words, ***nekkhammasita vedanā*** which are also  available  in  the  continuum  of  mind  of  virtuous  persons  who  are  lacking  ***vipassanā*** knowledge are explained in commentary and sub-commentary of ***Mahāvagga*** as follows. \_\_\_
