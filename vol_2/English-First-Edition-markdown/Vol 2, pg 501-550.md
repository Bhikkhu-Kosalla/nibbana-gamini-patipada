Through aiming at in a way that “I must liberate from suffering of rounds of rebirth”, these all kinds of obligations of practices, viz., the practices of person who goes to ***bhikkhus*** in order to ordain as Buddhist monk; the practices of a ***bhikkhu***; the practices of ***bhikkhu*** who  always  follows  strictly  ***catupārisuddhisīla***  (four  kinds  of  thoroughly  purified  moral conducts); the practices of ***bhikkhu*** who purifies those ***catu-pārisuddhisīla*** so as to be clear through and through; the practices of ***bhikkhu*** who follows austere regimen to forsake lust (***dhutanga***)  (of  which  there  are  thirteen);  the  practices  of  ***bhikkhu***  who  is  developing ***samatha*** practices, ***kasiṇa***-objects, preliminary objects (***parikamma***) etc., are worth desiring as ***nekkhamma*** (renunciation) in this case. 

1. Life of a ***bhikkhu*** is called ***nakkhamma***, due to capable of liberating from bondage called marriage life. 
1. The first absorption (***jhāna***) is called ***nekkhamma***, due to capable of liberating  from hindrances (***nīvaraṇa***). 
1. The Eternal Peace called ***nibbāna*** is called ***nekkhamma***, due to capable of liberating from all kinds of conditioned things (***saṅkhāra dhamma***). 
1. ***Vipassanā*** practice is called ***nekkhamma***, due to capable of liberating from unwholesome ***dhammas*** which can discern as ***nicca***, ***sukha***, ***atta***, ***subha***. 
1. All  kinds  of  wholesome  ***dhammas***  are  also  called  ***nekkhamma***,  due  to  capable  of liberating from unwholesome ***dhammas***. 

Thus and thus above all these ***dhammas*** are called ***nekkhamma***, due to capable of liberating from respective opposite ***dhammas***. 

Those mentally agreeable feeling, mentally disagreeable feeling, neutral feeling which arise by means of ***nekkhamma*** (renunciation), ***vipassanā***, ***anussati*** (repeated contemplation), the first absorption etc., are the feelings which are worth subsisting (***sevitabbavedanā***). 

Those  numerous  kinds  of  wholesome  mentally  agreeable  feelings,  viz,  mentally agreeable feeling which associates with wholesome consciousness which  arises during going towards  ***bhikkhus***  for  ordination;  mentally  agreeable  feeling  which  associates  with wholesome consciousness which arises by taking object of those wholesome deeds again; mentally  agreeable  feeling  which  associates  with  wholesome  consciousness  which  arises during restraining with  moral conducts; mentally  agreeable feeling which associates with wholesome  consciousness  which  arises  by  taking  object  of  preserved  morality  again; mentally  agreeable  feeling  which  associates  with  wholesome  consciousness  which  arises during  purifying  ***catupārisuddhisīla***  so  as  to  be  clear  through  and  through;  mentally agreeable feeling which associates with wholesome consciousness which arises by taking object of purified virtue again; mentally agreeable feeling which associates with wholesome consciousness  which  arises  during  fulfilling  austere  regimen  to  forsake  lust  (***dhutanga***); mentally agreeable feeling which associates with wholesome consciousness which arises by taking object of practice of ***dhutanga*** again; mentally agreeable feelings which associate with first absorption, second absorption, third absorption which arise by developing preliminary work of mindfulness of breathing etc., wholesome mentally agreeable feelings which arise by taking objects of those absorption ***dhammas*** and the fourth absorption etc., again; mentally agreeable  feeling  which  associates  with  ***vipassanā***  knowledge  mentally  agreeable  feeling which  is  satisfying  by  taking  object  of  ***vipassanā***  knowledge  again;  mentally  agreeable feeling which associates with access concentration which arises through developing ***anussati kammaṭṭhāna***  (repeated  contemplation);  are  mentally  agreeable  feelings  which  are  worth subsisting  really.  Due  to  subsisting  on  those  mentally  agreeable  feeling,  unwholesome ***dhammas*** become decreased but wholesome ***dhammas*** can increase, resulting in deserving to 

subsist on those feelings. 

**PAGE-502** 

2. These kinds of mentally disagreeable feelings which arise by depending upon ordination; practice  of  morality,  practice  of  ***dhutanga***  etc.;  practices   of  performing  preliminary objects of ***kasiṇa***-objects etc.; falling back of absorptions, first absorption etc.; practices of repeated contemplations called ***anussati-kammaṭṭhāna***; ***vipassanā*** knowledge, due to inability to lead so as to reach the Path-Knowledge and Fruit-Knowledge, are mentally disagreeable feelings which are worth subsisting really. 
2. These kinds of neutrality which arises by depending upon various renunciation elements mentioned above; wholesome neutral feeling which arises together with those wholesome ***dhammas*** called ***nekkhamma dhātu***; neutral feeling which is associating with ***vipassanā*** knowledge;  ***vipassanupekkhā***  called  the  mental  concomitant,  ***tatramajjhattatā*** (equanimity),  neutral  feeling  which  arises  through  repeated  contemplations  called ***anussatikammaṭṭhāna***; neutrality called ***tatramajjhattata*** which arises by taking object of first absorption, second absorption, third absorption neutral feeling which associates with the  fourth  absorption,  neutral  feeling  which  arise  by  depending  upon  that  fourth absorption; are neutrality which are worth subsisting really. 

The righteous ***meditator*** who keeps mentality-corporeality in mind through discerning on the feeling as priority must discern those ***sāmisa sukha***, ***sāmisa dukkha***, ***sāmisa upekkhā vedanā***  which  are  also  called  ***gehasita  somanassa***,  ***domanassa***,  ***upekkhā***  and  ***nirāmisa upekkhā,  nirāmisa  dukkha***,  ***nirāmisa  upekkhā***  which  are  also  called  ***nekkhammasita somanaasa***, ***domanassa***, ***upekkhā*** through expanding one’s intelligence. He has to endeavour to keep mentality-corporeality in mind through discerning on the feeling as priority. 

During  keeping  mental  ***dhammas***  which  arise  by  taking  object  of  (28)  kinds  of corporealities, if he can keep mental ***dhammas*** which are consisting in both wholesome and unwholesome  five-doors-cognitive  process  in  mind  through  discerning  on  the  feeling  as priority, the ways of  keeping ***sāmisa sukha***, ***dukkha***, ***upekkhā vedanā***, ***niramisa sukha***, ***dukkha***, ***upekkhā vedanā*** in mind are also inclusive in those mental ***dhammas***. 

During  keeping  in  mind  continuity  of  consciousness  of  wholesome  morality impulsions of mind-door-cognitive process called ***sammāvācā***, ***sammākammanata***, ***sammā ājīva,*** if one can discern the feeling as priority, the ways of keeping ***nirāmisa sukha vedanā***, ***upekkhā vedanā*** in mind are also inclusive. When mentally disagreeable feeling arises by depending  on  those  ***sīlamagganga***  (factors  of  path  of  morality),  if  one  can  keep  those unwholesome ***dhammas*** in mind through discerning on the disagreeable feeling as priority, it can be said ***nirāmisa dukkha vedanā*** can be kept in mind. 

It should be understood those various ways of keeping mental ***dhammas*** of ***anussati bhāvanā***, ***buddhānussati***, ***maraṇānussati***  etc., in mind in similar way. 

**PAGE-503** 

During keeping absorption mental ***dhammas*** in mind, if one can discern the feeling as priority, those ways of keeping ***nirāmisa sukha vedanā***, ***upekkhā vedanā*** are also inclusive. When mentally disagreeable feeling arises by either depending on those absorptions or due to falling back of acquired absorption, if one can keep mental ***dhammas*** of hatred group in mind through  discerning  on  the  disagreeable  feeling  as  priority,  the  way  of  keeping  ***nirāmisa*** ***dukkha vedanā*** is also inclusive. 

**V.30. *vedanā* (feeling) and *anusaya* (underlying tendency)**  

***Pali Quotation (M-3-332-333)*** 

- ***Bhikkhus*** … seeing-consciousness arises by depending upon eye-door and visible-object. Due to coincidence of three ***dhammas*** called eye-door, visible-object, seeing-consciousness, the contact (***phassa***) arises consequently. Due to presence of the factor called contact, any kind of feelings, ***sukha*** or ***dukkha*** or ***upekkhā*** arises. When that person comes in contact with agreeable feeling he likes the visible-object extremely; he yearns and exists through obsessing as much as swallowing; underlying tendency of lust (***rāgānusaya***) is embedded in the continuum of mind of that person. When disagreeable feeling is come in contact with he grieves;  he  is  wearied,  he  weeps  and  wails  in  grief;  he  laments  and  reaches  into bewilderment; underlying tendency of hatred is embedded in the continuum of mind of that person. When neutral feeling is come in contact with he does not know any kind of  the phenomenon  of  arising  (=  nature  of  origin  of  arising  and  nature  of  arising);  or  the phenomenon  of  ceasing  (=  nature  of  origin  of  cessation  and  nature  of  cessation)  of  that neutral feeling or nature of deserving to please; or faults (called ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***vipariṇāma dhamma***);  or  factors  of  liberation,  as  it  really  is;  underlying  tendency  of  ignorance  is embedded  in  the  continuum  of  mind  of  that  person.  ***Bhikkhu***  …  there  is,  actually,  no circumstance so as to be capable of extinguishing of ***kilesa dukkha***, ***samsāra vaṭṭa dukkha*** in present life without removing the underlying tendency of lust on agreeable feeling; without abrogating the underlying tendency of hatred on disagreeable feeling; without annulling the underlying tendency of ignorance and without bringing forth knowledge on neutral feeling. (It was preached similarly on ear-door, audible-object etc.) **(M-3-332,333)** 

**PAGE-504** 

***Pali Quotation* *(M-3-333,334)*** 

***Bhikkhus*** … seeing-consciousness arises by depending upon eye-door and visible- object.  Due  to  coincidence  of  three  ***dhammas***  called  eye-door,  visible-object,  seeing- consciousness, the contact (***phassa***) arises consequently. Due to presence of the factor called contact, any kind of feelings, ***sukha*** or ***dukkha*** or ***upekkhā*** arises. When that person comes in contact with agreeable feeling he does not like visible-object; he does not yearn, exist as much as swallowing; underlying tendency of lust is not embedded in the continuum of mind of that person. When disagreeable feeling is come an contact with he does not grieve; is not wearied; he does not weep and wail in grief; he does not lament and reach into bewilderment; underlying tendency of hatred is not embedded in the continuum of mind of that person. When neutral feeling is come in contact with he knows both the phenomenon of arising (= nature of origin of arising and nature of arising); the phenomenon of ceasing (= nature of origin of cessation and nature of cessation) of that neutral feeling; nature of deserving to please; faults (called ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***vipariṇāma dhamma***); and factor of lieration from neutral feeling, as they really are; underlying tendency of ignorance is not embedded in the continuum of mind of that person. ***Bhikkhu*** … there are, indeed, circumstances so as to be capable of extinguishing of ***kilesa dukkha samsāra vaṭṭa dukkha*** in present life through removing of underlying tendency of lust on agreeable feeling; 

through  abrogating  of  underlying  tendency  of  hatred  on  disagreeable  feeling;  through annulling  of  underlying  tendency  of  ignorance  and  through bringing  forth  knowledge  on neutral feeling. (It was preached similarly on ear-door, audible-object etc.) **(*M-3-333,334*)** 

According to these preaching found in ***Cha chakka Sutta*** by the Exalted One, because ***saupādisea nibbāna*** which is extinguishment of ***kilesa dukkha*** and ***anupādisea nibbāna*** which is extinguishment of ***samsāra vaṭṭa dukkha*** (= suffering of rounds of rebirth) can never  arise  in  the  continuum  of  mind  of  virtuous  person  without  removing  underlying tendency of lust which is embedded in the wake of agreeable feeling; without abrogating underlying  tendency  of  hatred  which  is  embedded  in  the  wake  of  disagreeable  feeling; without  annulling  underlying  tendency  of  ignorance  which  is  embedded  in  the  wake  of neutral feeling and without bringing forth knowledge, the virtuous practising person has to endeavour in order to disappear ignorance but to arise enlightenment with strenuous effort. During endeavouring in that way it is not enough knowing disagreeable feeling only but agreeable feeling and neutral feeling are also essential to be known as they really are. 

The virtuous practising person has to fulfil the ability to discern and distinguish 

1. both every feeling which consists in each mind moment of cognitive processes which arise in fixed route of mind successively; 
1. and associating mental ***dhammas*** of those respective feeling within each mind moment, 
1. and  depended  base-corporealities  of  mental  ***dhammas***,  together  with  that  feeling  and object-corporealities. It should be recognized on those consciousness which are free from cognitive process (***vīthimutta citta)*** in similar way. 

**PAGE-505** 

***anusaya* (underlying tendency)** \_\_\_\_\_ 

The term, ***anusaya dhātu***, means that it is not defilement which arises apparently in three-time-phases called ***upāda-ṭhiti-bhanga***. It is only a kind of efficiency (= latent energy) of defilement which can arise by basing on improper way of taking into heart (= unwise attention) object after successive benefiting factors of contact-feeling which are arisen in the wake of coincidence of base (***vatthu***) and object. Every person has to endeavour to disappear ignorance  and  to  acquire  enlightenment  so  as  to  remove  those  underlying  tendencies completely. 

**(V).31. Disappearance of ignorance-acquiring enlightenment *Pali Quotation* *(Sam-2-259)*** 

1. If eye-transparent-element = eye-door, 
1. visible-objects, 
1. seeing-consciousness, 
1. eye-contact (***cakkhusamphassa***), 
1. each ***sukha vedanā***, ***dukkha vedanā***, ***upekkhā vedanā*** which arises by depending on eye- contact, can be known and seen by ***vipassanā*** knowledge \_\_\_\_\_ 
1) as ***annicca***, 
1) as ***dukkha***, 
1) as ***anatta***, 
1) as a-***subha*** \_\_\_\_\_ 

the ignorance (***avijjā***) will disappear and enlightenment will be acquired (***Sam-2-259***) 

Therefore,  if  the  virtuous  ***meditator***  wants  to  perform  (***vedanā  nupassanā satipaṭṭhāna***), after keeping mentality corporeality in mind through discerning on the feeling as priority and then causal ***dhammas*** are scrutinized \_\_\_\_\_ 

he has to perform ***vipassanā*** practice diligently through 

1. dividing two groups called twofold corporeality-mental method, or 
1. dividing five groups called fivefold aggregates method, or 
1. dividing twelve groups called twelvefold bases method, or 
4. dividing  eighteen  groups  called  eighteenfold  elements  method  and  those  conditioned things must be discerned as ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***. 

**PAGE-506 (v) 32. First stage of *cittānupassanā saṭipaṭṭhāna* *Pāli Quotation (M-1-76)*** 

- *Bhikkhus*…. How does the *bhikkhu* discern steadfastly on the consciousness (***citta***)? *Bhikkhus*, the *bhikkhu* following my Teaching knows (i.e. is aware of ) 
1. the consciousness accompanied by lust (***rāga***), as “consciousness with lust”; 
1. he knows the consciousness unaccompanied by lust, as “consciousness without lust”; 
1. he also knows the consciousness accompanied by anger (***dosa***), as “consciousness with anger”; 
1. he also knows the consciousness unaccompanied by anger, as “consciousness without anger”; 
1. he also knows the consciousness accompanied by delusion (***moha***), as “consciousness with delusion”; 
1. he  also  knows  the  consciousness  unaccompanied  by  delusion,  as  “consciousness without delusion”; 
1. he also knows the indolent state of consciousness (***samkhitta citta***), as “Indolent state of consciousness”; 
1. he also knows the distracted state of consciousness (***vikkhitta citta***), as “Distracted state of consciousness; 
1. he also knows the developed state of consciousness (***Mahaggata*** ***citta***), as “Developed state of consciousness”; 
1. he  also  knows  the  undeveloped  state  of  consciousness  (***a-mahaggata***  ***citta***),  as “Undeveloped state of consciousness”; 
1. he also knows the inferior state of consciousness (***sa-uttara*** ***citta***), as “Inferior state of consciousness”; 
1. he also knows the superior state of consciousness (***anuttara*** ***citta***), as “Superior state of consciousness”; 
1. he  also  knows  the  consciousness  in   a  state  of  concentration  (***samāhita***  ***citta***),  as “Consciousness in a state of concentration”; 
1. he also knows the consciousness not in a state of concentration (***asamāhita*** ***citta***), as “Consciousness not in a state of concentration”; 
1. he also knows the liberated state of consciousness (***vimutta*** ***citta***), as “Liberated state of consciousness”; 
1. he  also  knows  the  un-liberated  state  of  consciousness  (***avimutta***  ***citta***),  as  “Un- liberated state of consciousness”; (***M-1-76***) 

Basic meaning and way of unlocking the hidden meaning of these consciousness can be seen page 74, this volume. 

**V.33.  Specified rules** 

1. ***samkhittena vā vitthārena vā pariggahite rūpakammaṭṭhāna. (Abhi-A-2-252, M-A- 1-280***) 
- According  to  specified  rules  found  in  commentaries  that  “after  keeping ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna*** in mind through either brief method or detailed method of four elements meditation”\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

the practicing person who wants to develop this ***cittānupassanā*** ***saṭipaṭṭhāna*** \_\_\_\_\_ must accomplish to distinguish and keep corporeal ***dhamma*** in mind beforehand. 

2. ***Pāli Quotation (Abhi-A-2-252, M-A-1-280)*** 
- In  the  insight  of  such  practicing  person,  the  consciousness  is  apparent;  that 

practicing person also keeps ***phassapañcamaka*** ***dhamma*** in mind and distinguishes through taking into heart in a way that \_\_\_\_ “ not only this consciousness but also contact which is capable of coming into contact with that object arise together with consciousness; the feeling which  is  capable  of  tasting  that  object,  also  arises;  the  perception,  which  is  capable  of perceiving by making mark, also arises; the volition which is capable of urging associating ***dhammas*** in order to reach towards that object, also arises”. ***(Abhi-A-2-252, M-A-1-280)*** 

Thus,  in  accordance  with  specified  rules  found  in  commentaries,  the  virtuous practicing person should not discern and keep consciousness only in mind. But he has to discern  all  associating  mental  concomitants  within  every  mind  moment  together  with consciousness through breaking down each compactness of mentality called ***nāmaghana*** by penetrative  insight  knowledge  in  order  to  reach  ultimate  nature  of  mentality.  This  is  the second important rule which must also be followed respectfully. 

**PAGE-508** 

Without following and fulfilling these two rules, 

1. accomplishment to keep corporeal ***dhamma*** in mind, 
1. keeping all associating mental ***dhammas*** of each consciousness in mind,  

if one performs ***cittānupassanā*** ***saṭipaṭṭhāna***, even though one’s flesh will be bruised and one’s bone will be rotten, the arising of true ***vipassanā*** knowledge will be farther than distance between sky and earth really. All virtuous persons should like to keep awareness. 

Here the first stage of ***cittānupassanā*** ***saṭipaṭṭhāna*** is finished. 

**PAGE-509 (V) 34. First stage of *dhammānupassana* *saṭipaṭṭhāna* *Pāli*** ***Quotation*** ***(M-A-1-285)* 3 paragraphs *(Abhi-A-2-256)*** 

After preaching on ***cittānupassanā*** ***saṭipaṭṭhāna*** through (16) varieties, henceforward 

\_\_\_\_ 

the  preaching,  ***Kathañca***  ***bhikkhave***  etc.,  was  preached  in  order  to  preach ***dhammānupassana*** ***saṭipaṭṭhāna*** through (5) varieties, viz 

1. ***nīvaraṇa*** ***pubba*** = section on the Hindrances 
1. ***khandha*** ***pubba*** = section on the Five Aggregates 
1. ***āyatana pubba*** = section on the Twelve Sense-Bases 
1. ***bojjhanga*** ***pubba*** = section on seven Factors of Enlightenment 
1. ***sacca*** ***pubba*** = section on the Four Noble Truths. ***(M-A-1-285)*** 

In  other  words,  the  Exalted  One  gave  a  discourse  on  the  way  of  keeping  pure corporeal ***dhamma*** in mind by means of ***kāyānupassanā*** ***saṭipaṭṭhāna***; he gave a discourse on  the  way  of  keeping   pure  mental  ***dhamma***  in  mind  by  means  of  ***cittānupassanā*** ***saṭipaṭṭhāna***;  henceforward\_\_\_\_\_  the  Exalted  One  went  on  with  the  discourse,  ***dhamma*** ***nupassanā*** ***saṭipaṭṭhāna***, “***Kathañca*** ***bhikkhave*** etc., in order to expound way of keeping both corporeal and mental ***dhammas*** in mind by means of ***dhamma*** ***nupassanā*** ***saṭipaṭṭhāna***. ***(M-A-1-285)*** 

In the next method \_\_\_\_\_ only the way of keeping corporeal aggregate in mind (= Knowledge of Discerning on the Corporeality, ***rūpapariggaha ñāṇa***) was preached by means of  ***kāyānupassanā***  ***saṭipaṭṭhāna***.  Only  the  way  of  keeping  feeling  aggregate  in  mind  (= Knowledge of Discerning on the Feeling) was preached by means of ***vedanā*** ***nupassanā*** ***saṭipaṭṭhāna***. Only the way of keeping consciousness aggregate in mind (= Knowledge of Discerning on the Consciousness) was preached by means of ***cittānupassanā*** ***saṭipaṭṭhāna***. 

**PAGE-510** 

Henceforward  \_\_\_\_\_  The  Exalted  One  began  ***dhammānupassana***  ***saṭipaṭṭhāna***, “***Kathañca*** ***bhikkhave*** etc., in order to expound the ways of keeping perception aggregate, formation  aggregate  also  in  mind  (=  Knowledge  of  Discerning  on  the  Perception, ***saññāpariggaha*** ***ñāṇa***, Knowledge of Discerning on the Formations, ***saṅkhāra*** ***pariggaha ñāṇa***) through discerning on associating mental ***dhammas*** as priority. (***Abhi-A-2-256, M-A- 1-285***) 

***Pāli Quotation (M-ṭī-1-373)*** 

With regard to the term, ***saññā*** ***saṅkhārakkhandhapariggahampi***, which is found in commentary,  the  term,  ***pi***  (also),  must  be  inferred  as  ways  of  keeping  all  five  clinging aggregates  in  mind  must  be  added  because  feeling  aggregate,  consciousness  aggregate, corporeal aggregate are also inclusive in those perception aggregate and formation aggregate. Pure perception aggregate and formation aggregate are unable to  arise  in the absence of feeling,  consciousness,  depended  base-corporealities  and  object-corporeality  (in  the  five- groups-existence). Therefore, although the ways of keeping perception aggregate, formation aggregate  in  mind  are  preached  significantly  by  means  of  ***dhammānupassana***,  feeling aggregate and consciousness aggregate which arise together with those perception aggregate and formation aggregate within the same moment must also be kept in mind. Over and above four mental aggregates are discerned corporeal aggregate called depended base-corporealities of those four mental aggregates and object-corporeality must also be kept in mind. Although perception aggregate and formation aggregate only are preached all five clinging aggregates must  be  kept  in  mind.  It  is  because  remaining  three  aggregates  are  included  in  those perception  and  formation  aggregates  really.  (It  is   called  preaching  methodology  of ***antogadha*** ***naya***, including method). (***M-ṭī-1-373***) 

In accordance with this explanation it should be recognized that among three ways of keeping ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*** in mind the way of keeping mental ***dhammas*** in mind through discerning  on  the  contact  as  priority  is  inclusive  in  this  Section  of  ***dhammānupassana*** ***saṭipaṭṭhāna***.  It  is  because  contact  is  a  ***dhamma***  which  is  inclusive  in  the  formation aggregate. 

**(V) 35.  First stage of *nīvaraṇapubba* (= section on hindrances) *Pāli* *Quotation* *(M-1- 76, 77)*** 

*Bhikkhus*, how does the *bhikkhu* discern steadfastly on ***dhamma*** ( mental and physical phenomena)  (and  perceive  that  they  are  just  phenomena  without  any  entity  or  soul)? *Bhikkhus*….  The  *bhikkhu*  following  my  Teaching  discerns  steadfastly  on  the  mental phenomena of the five hindrances. And how does the *bhikkhu* discern steadfastly on the five hindrances, (and perceive their soulness nature)? 

**PAGE-511** 

*Bhikkhus*…. When sense-desire (***kāmacchanda***) is present apparently in his internal continuum the *bhikkhu* following my Teaching knows “There is sense-desire in my internal continuum”; or when sense-desire is not present in his internal continuum he knows “There is no sense-desire in my internal continuum”. 

Furthermore he knows the factor how the sense which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows the factor how the sense-desire that has already arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows the factor how the discarded sense-desire will not arise in the future. (***M-1-76, 77***) 

Remaining kinds of hindrances, ill-will (***vyāpāda***), sloth and torpor (***thinamiddha***), distraction  and  remorse  (***uddhacca-kukkucca***),  skeptical  doubt  (***vicikicchā***)  were  also preached continuously in similar way. (***See M-1-77***) 

\1. ***nīvaraṇa*** (hindrances)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

Those ***dhammas*** which are capable of prohibiting not to arise wholesome ***dhammas***, absorption  etc.,  are  called  ***nīvaraṇa***  (hindrances).  In  this  ***Mahāsaṭipaṭṭhāna***  Sutta,  the Exalted One preached on those hindrances ***dhammas*** in five varieties. 

1. ***kāmacchanda*** ***nīvaraṇa*** = The craving (***taṇhā***) (=greed) which is heartfelt desire on sensual pleasure is called ***kāmacchanda***. Due to ability to hinder so as not to arise wholesome  ***dhammas***,  absorption  etc.,  that  ***kāmacchanda***  is  designated  as ***kāmacchanda*** ***nīvaraṇa***. 
1. The anger (***dosa***) which wants to destroy being, conditioned things is called ***vyāpāda*** (ill-will). 
1. The nature of sloth and torpor of consciousness and mental concomitants is called ***thina-middha***. 
1. The nature of distraction and nature of remorse are called ***uddhacca-kukkucca***. 
1. The nature of skeptical doubt on Triple Gems, action and conscequence of action etc., is called ***viccikicchā***. 

Due to ability to hinder so as not to arise wholesome ***dhammas***, absorption etc., those ***vyāpāda, thina-middha, uddhcca-kukkucca, vicikicchā*** are designated as ***vyāpāda nīvaraṇa, thina-middha nīvaraṇa, uddhacca-kukkucca   nīvaraṇa,  vicikicchānīva-nīvaraṇa,*** respectively. 

**(V) 36. *santa-asanta* (apparent presence-not presence) *Pāli*** ***Quotation*** ***(Abhi-A-2-257, M-A-1-285) (Mūlaṭī-2-158)* PAGE-512** 

During  arising  of  ***vipassanā***  knowledge  with  predominance  of  knowledge  of ***dhammānupassanā***  purified  wholesome  ***dhammas***  only  arise  continuously  but  dirty unwholesome ***dhammas***, hindrance of sense-desire etc., are unable to arise. Those purified ***dhammas*** and dirty ***dhammas*** can not arise simultaneously within the same mind moment, as two bulls fare yoked together. There is a reasonable question why it was preached in such way that hindrance ***dhammas***, sense-desire etc., which are apparently present must be known by  means  of  Knowledge  of  ***dhammānupassanā***.  The  commentator  Sayadaw,  therefore, expounds the term, ***santa*** (apparent presence) as “***abhiṇhasamudācaravasena***”. Even though hindrances ***dhammas***, sense=desire etc., are not present apparently through three-time-phases called  ***uppāda***-***thiti***-***bhanga***  while  the  knowledge  of  ***dhammānupassana***  is  arising,  the former can arise, off and on, at other periods, resulting in saying that “hindrances ***dhammas*** are still present apparently in the continuum of mind of that practicing person”. The term, ***asanta*** (not presence), means those hindrances ***dhammas*** which are not present by means of either  not  frequent  arising  of  unwholesome  ***dhammas***,  hindrance  of  sense-desire  etc.,  or accomplishment of eradicating by respective Noble Path ***dhammas***. 

**(V) 37. A noticeable fact** 

The virtuous practicing person should like to scrutinize explanations of above ***Pāli*** Text, commentary, subcommentary carefully. In this case, discerned mental ***dhammas*** are unwholesome  ***dhammas***,  sense-desire  etc.,  while  discerning  Knowledge  of ***dhammānupassana*** is, actually, continuity of  great wholesome impulsions of mind-door- cognitive process in the continuum of mind of worldly person and fulfilling person (***sekkha puggala***). 

While discerned unwholesome ***dhammas*** are arising through three-time-phases called ***uppāda***-***thiti***-***bhanga***,  wholesome  ***dhammas***  which  are  predominated  with  discerning knowledge of ***dhammānupassanā*** do not arise apparently and vice versa. 

However the Exalted One also instructed to discern those unwholesome ***dhammas***, which are not arising within three-time-phases called ***uppāda***-***thiti***-***bhanga***, which can be said still existing ***dhammas***, due to ability to arise, off and on, at other periods, in order to know discriminately  by  means  of  knowledge  of  ***dhammānupassanā***.  Commentary  and  sub- commentary also support that fact exactly. If list of Noble Ones who had enlightened and entered into the Eternal Peace called ***nibbāna*** is checked again, there were numerous Noble Ones who had got ability to discern past disappearing ***dhammas*** in the Noble Admonishment of the Supreme Buddha. Therefore it should be considered emphatically on the fact in the section  of  ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna***  “only  present  arising  ***dhammas***  must  be  discerned  as ***vipassanā*** practice”.

**(V)38. Origin of hindrance of sense-desire** 

***Pāli* *Quotation* *(Sam-3-90, Abhi-A-2-257, M-A-1-285, 286)*** 

***(Mūlaṭī-2-158)*** 

- Among those factors of arising and factors of discarding of hindrance of sense-

desire, hindrance of sense-desire, arises apparently, due to improper way of taking into heart on object which is bore in mind as ***subha***. 

***subhanimitta*** \_\_\_\_\_ It means that preceding sense-desire, which is capable of bearing in mind on object as “***subha***”, is also called ***subha*** ***nimitta*** (pleasant sign), because it is factor of arising of succeeding sense-desire. Comely pleasant object is also called ***subhanimitta***, due to occurrence of deserving to bear in mind as “***subha***”. 

***a-yonisomanasikāra*** \_\_\_\_\_ It means the way of taking into heart object through non-factor of availability of prosperities called the Path-Knowledge, Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna*** etc. 

It is wrong way of taking into heart on five aggregates, 

1. which are ***anicca*** as ***nicca***; or 
1. which are ***dukkha*** as ***sukha***; or 
1. which are ***anatta*** as ***atta***; or 
1. which are ***a-subha*** as ***subha***. 

Hindrance of sense-desire arises apparently in the continuum of mind of person who brings forth that ***a-yonisomanasikāra*** (= unwise attention) on that ***subhanimitta*** over and over. The Exalted One, therefore, preached as follows. 

*Bhikkhus*…. There is ***subhanimitta***; there are also frequent practices of improper way of taking into heart on that ***subhanimitta*** through non-factor of availability of prosperity; these frequent practices of improper way of taking into heart are factors of both apparent arising of sense-desire which has not yet arisen and proliferation and plenty of sense-desire which has arisen. ***(Sam-3-90; Abhi-A-2-257, M-A-1-285, 286)*** 

**PAGE-514 (V) 39. Factors of discarding hindrance of sense-desire *Pāli* *Quotation* *(M-A-1-286) (Mūlaṭī-2-158)*** 

In the next kind \_\_\_\_ discarding of that hindrance of sense-desire arises through proper way of taking into heart the object which is bore in mind as ***asubha*** (= ***asubha*** ***nimitta***), which is factor of availability of prosperities, the Path-Knowledge, Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna*** etc. ***asubhanimitta***  \_\_\_\_\_\_  The  absorption  (***jhāna***)  with  loathsome  object  is  also  called ***asubhanimitta***. Loathsome object is also called ***asubhanimitta***. It should be recognized on absorption of loathsome nature as absorptions which arise by taking objects of 

1. (10) kinds of mediation on foulness nature (= (10) kinds of corpses) found in section of ***samatha*** practice and 
1. (32) bodily parts, hair etc. 

If meditation on foulness nature is performed by taking any object of (10) kinds of corpses, swollen and rotten corpse of the same sex, the first absorption concentration can be obtained. 

Furthermore \_\_\_\_\_ if meditation on foulness nature is performed by taking object of any kind of internal (32) bodily parts or the whole (32) bodily parts (= by taking object of foulness  nature  of  any  bodily  part  or  the  whole  bodily  parts),  the  first  absorption concentration can be obtained. It was preached in ***Girimānanda Sutta*** by the Exalted One. 

Meditation  on  foulness  nature  which  is  performed  by  taking  object  of  corpse  is designated as ***a-viññāṇaka asubha*** ***kammaṭṭhāna*** while meditation on foulness nature which is performed by taking  object of foulness nature of (32) bodily parts of living beings is designated as ***sa-viññāṇaka asubha kammaṭṭhāna*** in ***Vijaya Sutta*** etc. (It can be seen in the section of ***samatha*** practice, **Volume V.**) 

**PAGE-515** 

***yonisomanasikāra* (wise attention)** 

It means the proper way of taking into heart object through factor of availability of prosperities, the Path-Knowledge, Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna*** etc.  

It is the proper way of taking into heart…… 

1. the five aggregates, corporeal and mental ***dhammas***, which are ***anicca***, as ***anicca***; 
1. the five aggregates, corporeal and mental ***dhammas***, which are ***dukkha***, as ***dukkha***; 
1. the five aggregates, corporeal and mental ***dhammas***, which are ***anatta***, as ***anatta***; 
1. the five aggregates, corporeal and mental ***dhammas***, which are ***a-subha***, as ***a-subha***; The hindrance of sense-desire has already discarded in the continuum of mind of 

practicing person who brings fourth that kind of wise attention (***yonisomanasikāra***), over and over on two kinds of ***asubha*** ***nimitta*** which can be called those absorption of foulness nature, object of foulness nature. The Exalted One, therefore, preached as follows:\_\_\_\_\_ 

*Bhikkhus*….. there is ***asubhanimitta***; there are also frequent practices of proper way of taking into heart on that ***asubhanimitta*** through factor of availability of prosperity, the Path-Knowledge, Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna***, etc., these frequent practices of proper way of taking into heart are factors of both non-arising of sense-desire which has not yet arisen and discarding of sense-desire which has arisen”. 

In this case, the commentator Sayadaw expounded four kinds of unwise attention and four kinds of wise attention in order to show unwise attention and wise attention thoroughly without any remain. Among those four kinds  

1. unwise attention, the way of taking into heart ***asubha*** as ***subha*** and  
1. wise attention, the way of taking into heart ***asubha*** as ***asubha*** are worth desiring in this section on hindrance of sense-desire. 

In  the  next  method \_\_\_\_\_\_  The  unwise  attention,  which  is  taking  into  heart  five aggregates as ***subha***, is benefited by remaining three kinds of unwise attention and three kinds  of  wrong  perceptions,  i.e.,  ***nicca***  ***saññā***  (permanence  perception)  ***sukhasaññā*** (happiness perception), ***attasaññā*** (self perception), through efficiency of relation of natural determinative  dependence  ***upanissaya  satti***),  Therefore  remaining  three  kinds  of  unwise attention  and  ***nicca***  ***saññā***,  ***sukha***  ***saññā***,  ***atta  saññā***  are  conformed  with  that  unwise attention which is capable of taking into heart object of foulness nature as ***subha*** (comely object). Therefore  remaining  kinds of unwise  attention are  worth desiring in this section showing hindrance of sense-desire. 

Similarly  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_  remaining  three  kinds  of  wise  attention  which  are  capable  of taking into heart five aggregates as ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta*** respectively and ***aniccasaññā*** (impermanence  perception),  ***dukkha***  ***saññā***  (suffering  perception),  ***anattasaññā***  (non-self perception), benefit the wise attention which is capable of taking heart five aggregates as ***asubha***  (foulness  nature)  and  a***subhasaññā***  (foulness  perception)  through  efficiency  of relation of natural determinative dependence. 

**PAGE-516** 

Therefore remaining three kinds of wise attention and ***anicca*** ***saññā***, ***dukkha*** ***saññā***, ***anattasaññā*** are conformed with the wise attention which is capable of taking into heart object of ***asubha*** as ***asubha***. Therefore remaining kinds of wise attention are worth desiring in this section showing hindrance of sense-desire. (***Mūlaṭī-2-158***) 

Among  four  kinds  of  ***anupassanā  ñāṇa***,  called  ***aniccanupassanā  ñāṇa***, ***dukkhanupassanā  ñāṇa***,  ***anattanupassanā  ñāṇa***,  ***a-subhanupassanā  ñāṇa***,  in  order  to attain sharp, brave, purified, matured ***anupassanā ñāṇa*** of one kind, remaining  kinds of a***nupassanāñāṇa***  are  essential  to  benefit  through  efficiency  of  relation  of  determinative dependence. Only when those benefiting factors are available can that ***anupassanā ñāṇa*** becomes sharp, brave, purified, matured. In this case, that kind of benefiting factor through efficiency of relation of determinative dependence is said as “conformed with”. (It will be explicit in section of ***Vipassanā***, **Volume V**.) 

**(V) 40. Next method \_\_\_\_\_ (6) factors of discarding hindrance of sense-desire** 

These (6) kinds of ***dhammas***, viz.,  

1. learning ***asubha*** ***nimitta*** (= object of foulness nature) 
1. repeated developing meditation on foulness nature over and over, 
1. occurrence  of  the  person  with  the  leaf  of  door  caller  mindfulness  which  always restrains with controlling faculties, eye etc. 
1. occurrence of the person who knows moderate measure of nourishment, 
1. occurrence of the person who has association with good teacher, good friends, 
1. presence of pertinent ***dhamma*** preaching relating to a***subhabhāvanā***, are for the sake of discarding sense-desire. 
1. The person who learns (10) kinds of objects of foulness nature, swollen and rotten corpses etc., (= meditation on foulness nature) can discard sense-desire. 
1. The person who develops, brings forth that meditation on foulness nature also can discard sense-desire. 
1. The person with the leaf of door called mindfulness which always closes through consistent putting one’s mind into any kind of meditation practices so as not to enter inferior unwholesome ***dhammas***, lust, anger, delusion etc., from (6) kinds of doors called controlling faculties, can discard sense-desire. 
1. The  practicing  person  who  knows  moderate  measure  of  nourishment  through balancing diet without continuation of having for food into stomach with space where four or five mouthful of food but by filling with water during having for lunch, also can discard sense-desire. ***(Abhi-A-2-257, 258)*** 

Some persons considered that “sloth and torpor can not suppress and overcome the person  who  knows  moderate  measure  of  nutriment;  if  drowsiness  is  absent,  meditation practice can always be taken into heart, resulting in un-opportunity to enter sense-desire; therefore the person who knows moderate measure of nourishment can discard sense-desire”. (This is opinion of other school of thought called ***vadantivāda***.) Due to lack of satisfaction on that ***vadantivāda, Mūlaṭīka*** Sayadaw expounded as follows.\_\_\_\_ 

**PAGE-517** 

Although those persons of other school of thought said in that way, that person who knows moderate measure of nourishment can bring forth ***āhārepaṭikula saññā*** (= perception of loathsomeness nature on nourishment). When ingested foods are digested both faces, urine together with sweat, semisolid discharge from the eye, cerumen etc., which secrete from nine kinds of natural openings and during eating, smearing with colour, smell etc., on hand, in the buccal cavity, etc., are consequences of digestion of that nourishment. Meditation on foulness nature can be developed by taking object of foulness nature of those consequences, faces, urine, snot, spittle, etc. Colour-***kasiṇa*** practices can be developed by taking object of colours of those bodily parts. Four great elements meditation can also be developed by taking object of four great elements of those bodily parts. That person who knows moderate measure of nourishment can therefore bring forth the knowledge which is capable of discerning foulness nature of consequence called digestion of that nourishment.  

That person who knows moderate measure of nourishment can, therefore, bring forth the knowledge which is capable of discerning foulness nature of either recent ingested food within  stomach  or  all  (32)  bodily  parts  where  those  nourishment  (=  ***āhārajarūpa***)  are spreading. 

That person who knows moderate measure of nourishment can therefore bring forth the knowledge which is capable of discerning foulness nature of that nourishment which is the relation of determinative dependence of sense-desire. 

That person who knows moderate measure of nourishment can therefore bring forth the knowledge which is capable of discerning occurrence of presence of depended factor of nutriment for all kinds of corporealities produced by four origins called ***karajakāyā***. (Please see again ***rūpakammaṭṭhāna***, Volume I.) 

That person  who  knows moderate  measure of nourishment  can, therefore, discard sense-desire. (***Mūlaṭī***-***2-158, 159***) 

5. The person who associates with good teacher and good friends, who are delighted with meditation on foulness nature, like Venerable ***Tissa Mahā Thero*** who always practiced meditation on foulness nature, also can discard hindrance of sense-desire. 
5. Hindrance  of  sense-desire  can  be  discarded  through  pertinent  ***dhamma***  preaching relating to (10) kinds of meditation on foulness nature for four kinds of deportments, i.e., reclining, sitting, standing, walking. Therefore it was expounded that (6) kinds of ***dhammas*** are factors of discarding hindrance of sense-desire. 

Furthermore  \_\_\_  he  distinguishes  clearly  on  the  nature  of  absolute  cessation  of hindrance of sense-desire, which has been discarded by these (6) factors, without reappearing in future through the Path-Knowledge of Arahant. (= He must endeavour in order to know clearly that nature.) (***Abhi-A-2-258***) 

(In the aspect of preaching methodology of ***Abhidamma***, all kinds of greed (***lobha***) can  be  designated  as  hindrance  of  sense-desire  and  then  it  explained  that  hindrance  is eradicated by the Path-Knowledge of Arahant.) 

**PAGE-518 (V) 41. Origin of hindrance of ill-will** 

Hindrance  of  ill-will  arises,  due  to  improper  way  of  taking  into  heart  (=  unwise attention)  the ***paṭighanimitta***  (=  emblem  of  hatred),  through  non-factor  of  availability  of prosperities, the Path-Knowledge, Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna*** etc. 

1. Preceding hatred, which can bring forth injured mind, is also called ***paṭighanimitta***, due to occurrence of factor of arising of succeeding hatred. 
1. The object which can bring forth hatred, injured mind, is also called ***paṭighanimitta***. 

Unwise attention (***a-yonisomanasikāra***) is, actually, the same characteristic for all kinds of hindrance ***dhammas***. 

Hindrance of ill-will arises apparently in the continuum of mind of person who brings forth  that  ***a-yonisomanasikāra***  (=  unwise  attention)  on  that  ***paṭigha***  over  and  over.  The Exalted One, therefore, preached as follows. 

*Bhikkhus*…. There is ***paṭigha***; there are also frequent practices of improper way of taking  into  heart  on  that  ***paṭigha***  through  non-factor  of  availability  of  prosperity;  these frequent practices of improper way of taking into heart are factors of both apparent arising of ill-will which has not yet arisen and proliferation and plenty of ill-will which has arisen. ***(Sam-3-91, 92; Abhi-A-2-258)*** 

**(V) 42. Factors of discarding hindrance of ill-will** 

Discarding of that hindrance of ill-will arises through proper way of taking into heart (= wise attention) the ***mettācetovimutti dhamma*** called absorption of loving-kindness which associates with ***mettā***, which is factor of liberating from opposite hindrance of mind, which is factor of availability of prosperities, the Path-Knowledge, Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna*** etc. In those words, ***mettāya*** ***cetovimutti***ya, both the full-absorption of loving-kindness and access- absorption of loving-kindness which are called ***mettā***, are suitable,; for the term, ***cetovimutti*** (= ***mettācetovimutti***), actually, only full-absorption of loving-kindness is suitable to infer. Wise attention called ***yonisomanasikāra*** has got the characteristic shown as above. 

The practicing person who brings forth that wise attention, over and over, on those full-absorption  of  loving-kindness  and  access-absorption  of  loving-kindness,  can  discard hindrance  of  ill-will.  (It  refers  to  ***vipassanā***  discerning  through  generalizing  on  mental ***dhammas***  of  absorption  of  loving-kindness  called  full-absorption,  access-absorption,  as ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***.) The Exalted One, therefore, preached as follows;       

**PAGE-519** 

*Bhikkhus*….. there is ***mettācetovimutti dhamma***; there are also frequent practices of proper  way  of  taking  into  heart  on  that  ***mettācetovimuttidhamma***  through  factor  of availability  of  prosperity,  the  Path-Knowledge,  Fruit-Knowledge,  ***nibbāna***,  etc.,  these frequent practices of proper way of taking into heart are factors of both non-arising of ill-will which has not yet arisen and discarding of ill-will which has arisen”. ***(Sam-3-91; M-A-1-271)*** 

**(V) 43 Next method\_\_\_\_ (6) factors of discarding hindrance of ill-will** 

These (6) kinds of ***dhammas***, viz., 

1. learning meditation which is the object of loving-kindness, 
1. repeated developing meditation on ***mettābhāvanā***, over and over, 
1. bearing in mind the occurrence of one’s own property as ***kamma*** only, 
1. frequent performing the function of reasoning through knowledge, 
1. occurrence of person who has association with good teacher, good friends, 
1. presence of pertinent ***dhamma*** preaching relating to ***mettābhāvanā***, are for the sake of discarding hindrance of ill-will. 
1. ***odissaka*** ***mettā*** \_\_\_\_\_\_Through taking object of these kinds of persons,\_\_\_\_ 
1) ***atta*** = oneself (Absorption is not available through taking object of oneself.) 
1) ***garu bhāvaniya*** = respectable person with the same sex, 
1) ***atippiya sahāya*** = very affectionate friend with the same sex, 
1) ***majjhatta*** = moderate affectionate neutral friend with the same sex, 
1) ***verī*** = enemy = hate person with the same sex, 

***mettābhāvanā***  is  developed  over  and  over,  in  the  objects  of  persons  shown  in  number (b,c,d,e) it can bring forth the absorption up to the third absorption. That kind of loving- kindness can be said as ***odissaka mettā*** (loving-kindness with demarcation of dedication). 

***anodissaka*** ***mettā*** 

When absorption of loving-kindness can be entered in order to be equal efficiency of ***mettā*** on above five kinds of persons, ***atta***, ***garu bhāvanīya*** etc., if demarcation of dedication as this person is ***atta***, this person is ***garu*** ***bhāvanīya*** etc., is broken down, if equal efficiency of ***mettā***  on  every person  is  available,  that  absorption  of  loving-kindness  can be  said  as ***anodissaka*** ***mettā*** (loving-kindness without demarcation of dedication). 

***disāpharaṇamettā*** 

The absorption of loving-kindness which is entered through spreading ***mettā*** on all beings existing in any kind of direction, east etc., is called ***disāpharaṇa mettā***. 

The next method \_\_\_\_ the absorption of loving-kindness which is developed through spreading ***mettā*** by means of the whole range of a monastery, left-right demarcation of road, the whole range of a village etc., is called ***odissaka disāpharaṇa*** ***mettā***. 

**PAGE-520** 

The absorption of loving-kindness which is developed through spreading ***mettā*** on all beings by means of directions, east direction etc., without showing demarcation of space, the whole range of a monastery etc., is called ***anodissaka disāpharaṇa mettā. (Mūlaṭī-2-150)*** 

When meditation on loving-kindness is learned from teacher the practicing person has to  learn  that  meditation  through  three  ways,  i.e.,  ***odissaka***  ***mettā***,  ***anodissaka***  ***mettā***, ***disāpharaṇa*** ***mettā***. The person who learns meditation on loving-kindness in that way, also can discard hindrance of ill-will. ***(Abhi-A-2- 259)*** 

2. The  practicing  person  who  brings  froth  absorption  of  loving-kindness  through developing  ***odisamettā,  anodhisamettā***,***disāpharaṇa***  ***mettā***,  also  can  discard hindrance of ill-will. (Way of developing can be seen in Section of ***samatha*** practice, **Volume V**.) 
3. The person who bears in mind the occurrence of one’s won property as ***kamma*** only in a way that….. 

“Oh…..virtuous person, if you have got hatred and fuming with anger him, what you can  do  anymore!.....  Are  you  able  to  destroy  this person’s  virtue,  concentration,  wisdom called three trainings? You have got present existence, due to presence of past ***kamma*** (= action) of yourself and will you go coming-into-existence, due to presence of only ***kamma*** of your present existence? Anger with other is similar to the person who wants to hit other with live coal by handling it; who wants to hit other with flaming red iron rod by handling it; who wants to hit other with loathsome faces by handling it; If other one anger with you, can he do anymore? Can he destroy your virtue, concentration, wisdom called three training etc.? This other one has got present existence, due to presence of past ***kamma*** of himself and then he will go on the next coming into existence, due to presence of present ***kamma*** of himself; As unacceptable gift returns back to giver only, as dust falls on oneself again when one throws dust windward, the hatred of that other will fall on other only”, can discard hindrance of ill- will. (***Abhi-A-2-259***) 

4. After  bearing  in  mind  the  occurrence  of  both  one’s  and  other’s  own  property  as ***kamma***  only,  the  person,  who  lies  on  ***vipassanā***  knowledge  which  is  capable  of reasoning and discerning through proper way, also can discard hindrance of ill-will. (The  knowledge  which  is  capable  of  discerning  on  both  internal  and  external conditioned things, corporeal and mental ***dhammas*** together with causal ***dhammas*** as ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***, is called ***paṭisankhā ñāṇa*** (Knowledge of Reflection). 

The person, who lies on that Knowledge of Reflection, also can discard hindrance of ill-will. (***Abhi-A-2-259***) 

5. The person who associates with good teacher and good friends, who are delighted with  meditation  on  loving-kindness,  like  Venerable  Assagutta  ***Mahā***  Thero  who always practiced meditation on loving-kindness, also can discard hindrance of ill-will. ***(Abhi-A-2-259)*** 
5. Hindrance of ill-will can be discarded through pertinent ***dhamma*** preaching relating to meditation on loving-kindness for four kinds of deportments, i.e., reclining, sitting, standing, walking. Therefore it was expounded that (6) kinds of ***dhammas*** are factors of discarding hindrance of ill-will. (***Abhi-A-2-259***) 

Therefore it is explained that these (6) kinds of ***dhammas*** are factors of discarding of hindrance of ill-will. 

Furthermore  \_\_\_  he  distinguishes  clearly  on  the  nature  of  absolute  cessation  of hindrance of ill-will, which has been discarded by these (6) factors, without reappearing in future through the Path-Knowledge of Non-returnee. (= He must endeavour in order to know clearly that nature.) ***(Abhi-A-2-259)*** 

**PAGE-521 (V) 44. Origin of hindrance of sloth-torpor** 

*Bhikkhus*…..  there  is  not  delighted  in  meditation  practice;  there  is  laziness  and stretching  body,  hands;  there  is  surfeited  with  food;   there  is  shrinking  of  mind  from meditation practice. There are also frequent practices of improper way of taking into heart (= unwise attention) on those factors, not delighted in meditation practice etc., through non- factor of  availability of prosperities, the Path-Knowledge,  Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna*** etc; these frequent practices of improper way of taking into heart are factors of both apparent arising of hindrance of sloth-torpor which have not arisen yet and proliferation and plenty of hindrance of sloth-torpor which have arisen. (***Sam-3-91***) 

**(V) 45. Factors of discarding hindrance of sloth-torpor** 

The ability to discard those hindrances of sloth-torpor can arise through proper way of taking into heart (= wise attention) on ***ārambhadhātu*** (=beginning effort) etc., which is factor of availability of prosperities, the Path-Knowledge, Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna*** etc. 

The  term,  ***ārambhadhātu***,  means  beginning  effort  called  ***vīriya***.  The  term, ***nikkamadhātu***, means diligence which is stronger than ***ārambhadhātu***, due to occurrence of liberating  from  laziness  and  boredom  to  take  object  of  meditation  practice.  The  term, ***parakkamadhātu***, means, strenuous energy which is stronger than ***nikkamadhātu***, due to capable  of  reaching  into  higher  and  higher  stages  of  meditation  practice.  The  practicing person who brings forth proper way of taking into heart (= wise attention) on effort called ***vīriya*** with three varieties over and over through factor of availability of prosperities, the Path-Knowledge, Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna*** etc., can discard hindrances of sloth-torpor. The Exalted One, therefore, preached as follows:\_\_\_\_\_ 

*Bhikkhus*…..  there  is  “***vīriya***  with  three  varieties,  ***ārambhadhātu***,  ***nikkamadhātu***, ***parakkamadhātu***”; there are also frequent practices of proper way of taking into heart on that “***vīriya***  with  three  varieties,  ***ārambhadhātu***,  ***nikkamadhātu***,  ***parakkamadhātu***”  through factor  of  availability  of prosperity,  the  Path-Knowledge,  Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna***,  etc., these frequent practices of proper way of taking into heart are factors of both non-arising of sloth-torpor which has not arisen yet and discarding of sloth-torpor which has arisen”. ***(Sam- 3-92; M-A-1-288)*** 

**(V) 46. Next method\_\_\_\_\_ (6) factors of discarding hindrance of sloth-torpor** 

These (6) kinds of ***dhammas***, viz.,  

1. thinking on over-eating as factor of sloth-torpor; 
1. occurrence of the person who usually has got alternate deportments; 
1. taking into heart perception of light (= taking into heart light which associates with perception of light), 
1. staying at barren plain; 
1. occurrence of the person who has association with good teacher, good friends; 
1. presence of pertinent ***dhamma*** preaching relating to factor of discarding sloth-torpor; 

are for the sake of discarding hindrance of sloth-torpor. 

1) A brahmin called ***a āharahatthaka***\_\_\_ The gluttonous Brahmin who eats too much so as to say that “pull my hand… please!, due to inability to stand up he himself after meal, is called ***āharahatthaka brahmin***. 
1) A ***brahmin*** called ***bhuttavamitaka*** \_\_\_\_ The gluttonous Brahmin who eats too much so as to vomit ingested food at eating place, due to inability to digest well, is called ***bhuttavamitaka brahmin***. 
1) A Brahmin called ***tatravaṭṭaka*** \_\_\_\_\_ The  gluttonous Brahmin who eats too much so as to sleep at eating place,due to inability to stand up after meal, is called ***tatravaṭṭaka brahmin***. 
1) A Brahmin called ***alamsāṭaka*** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ The gluttonous Brahmin who eats too much so as not to wear lower garment, due to occurrence of getting quite a paunch, although he can stand up after meal, is called ***alamsāṭaka*** Brahmin. 
1) A Brahmin called ***kākamāsaka*** \_\_\_\_\_ 

The gluttonous brahmin who eats too much so as to be taken food out from buccal cavity by crow, due to filling with food up to opening of buccal cavity, is called ***kāka māsaka brahmin***. ***(Abhi-A-1-432)*** 

1. After over-eating too much like these (5) kinds of Brahmin, in the continuum of mind of practicing *bhikkhu* who develop obligation of *bhikkhu*’s ***dhamma*** by sitting at the place  where  day-time  practice  and  night-time  practice  are  performed,  sloth-torpor ***dhamma***  usually  comes  and  reaches  through  suppressing  like  full-grown  male elephant.  That  sloth-torpor  ***dhamma***  cannot  arise  in  the  continuum  of  mind  of practicing *bhikkhu* who usually has sufficient nourishment by drinking only water but leaving space where four or five mouthful food can be filled within stomach. Thus the *bhikkhu* who thinks on over-eating as factor of sloth-torpor also can discard hindrance of sloth-torpor. ***(Abhi-A-260)*** 

Those words,” thinking on over-eating as factor of sloth-torpor means “thinking on whether or not factor of sloth-torpor in a way that “if this extent of nourishment is eaten, it is factor of sloth-torpor; if this extent of nourishment is eatern, it is not factor of sloth-torpor”. (***Mūlaṭī-2-159***) 

**PAGE-523** 

2. Sloth-torpor  fall  in  such  deportment;  the  *bhikkhu*  who  alters  any  kind  of  other deportments, rather than that deportment in which sloth-torpor fall, also can discard sloth-torpor. (Although sloth and torpor arise during lying, when he stands up he can discard sloth and torpor consequently; it should be understood in this way etc.) (***Abhi- A-2-260***) 
2. The *bhikkhu* who takes into heart moon-light, candle-light, flambeau-light at night and sun-light at day-time (= the *bhikkhu* who develops perception of light) also can discard hindrance of sloth-torpor. 
2. The *bhikkhu* who stays at barren plain also can discard hindrance of sloth-torpor. 
2. The  *bhikkhu*  who  associates  with  good  teacher  and  good  friends  who  have  got discarded  hindrance  of  sloth-torpor  like  the  Most  Venerable  ***Mahākassapa  Mahā*** ***Thero***, also can discard hindrance of sloth-torpor. (***Abhi-A-2-260***) 
2. Hindrance  of  sloth-torpor  can  be  discarded  through  pertinent  ***dhamma***  preaching relating to practices of austere regimen in four kinds of deportment, i.e., reclining, sitting, standing, walking, due to occurrence of depending on strenuous energy of practices of austere regimen called ***dhutanga*** ***dhamma***. (***Abhi-A-2- 260***) 

Therefore  it  was  expounded  that  (6)  kinds  of  ***dhammas***  are  factors  of  discarding hindrance of sloth-torpor. He distinguishes clearly on the nature of absolute cessation of hindrance of sloth-torpor, which has been discarded by these (6) factors, without reappearing in future through the Path-Knowledge of arahant. (= he must endeavour in order to know clearly that nature. ) ***(Abhi-A-2-260)*** 

**(V) 47. Origin of hindrance of distraction-remorse** 

When remorse (***kukkuca) dhamma*** arise by means of sadness which follows along with misdeed which has been done and good deed which has not been done, it has got the same character of distraction (***uddhacca***). Therefore the commentary explained the nature of distraction as ***uddhacca-kukkucca. (Mūlaṭī-2-159)*** 

**PAGE-524** 

Hindrance of distraction-remorse arises apparently, due to improper way of taking into heart (= unwise attention) the object which can bring forth distraction, which is non- factor of availability of prosperities, the Path-Knowledge,  Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna*** etc. Distraction means the nature of restlessness by which a person’s attention draw away from any object. The basic meaning of distraction is ***uddhacca kukkucca***. 

Hindrance  of  distraction-remorse  arises  apparently  in  the  continuum  of  mind  of person who brings forth that ***a-yonisomanasikāra*** (= unwise attention) on that “object which can bring forth restlessness” over and over. The Exalted One, therefore, preached as follows. 

*Bhikkhus*….  There  is  “object  which  can  bring  forth  restlessness”;  there  are  also frequent practices of improper way of taking into heart on that “object which can bring forth restlessness”  through  non-factor  of  availability  of  prosperity;  these  frequent  practices  of improper way of taking into heart are factors of both apparent arising of distraction-remorse which has not arisen yet and proliferation and plenty of distraction-remorse which has arisen. ***(Sam-3-91, Abhi-A-2-260, 261)*** 

**(V) 48. Factors of discarding hindrance of distraction-remorse** 

Ability to discard that hindrance of distraction-remorse arises, due to proper way of taking into heart (=wise attention) tranquility of mind which can be said concentration, in the next method, the ***dhamma*** which can bring  forth tranquility of  mind,  which is factor of availability of prosperities, the Path-Knowledge, Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna*** etc. The Exalted One, therefore, preached as follows:-\_\_\_ 

*Bhikkhus*….. there is “tranquility of mind, in the next method, the ***dhamma*** which can bring forth tranquility of mind”; there are also frequent practices of proper way of taking into heart on  that  “tranquility  of  mind,  in  the  next  method,  the  ***dhamma***  which  can  bring  forth tranquility of mind”; through factor of availability of prosperity, the Path-Knowledge, Fruit- Knowledge, ***nibbāna***, etc., these frequent practices of proper way of taking into heart are factors of both non-arising of “distraction-remorse” which has not yet arisen and discarding of “distraction-remorse” which has arisen”. ***(Sam-3-93, M-A-1-289)*** 

(V) 49. Next method \_\_\_\_ (6) factors of discarding hindrance of distraction-remorse 

These (6) kinds of ***dhammas***, viz.,  

1. occurrence of the person with great general knowledge, 
1. occurrence of the person who usually enquires over and over, 
1. occurrence of the person who knows principle of Monastic Codes (***vinaya***); 
1. occurrence of the person who usually approaches elder ***Mahā*** ***Theras***, 
1. occurrence  of  the  person  who  has  got  association  with  good  teacher  and  good friends, 
1. occurrence of the person who has pertinent ***dhamma*** preaching relating to factors of discarding hindrance of distraction-remorse, 

are for the sake of discarding hindrance of distraction-remorse. (***Abhi-A-2-261***) **PAGE-525** 

1. Due to occurrence of the person with great general knowledge, the person who learns any part of the five parts of ***Sutta*** ***Pitaka*** called ***Nikāya*** or all parts of ***Nikāya*** through either ***Pāli*** Text or commentary, also can discard hindrance of distraction-remorse. Distraction of mind cannot arise in the continuum of mind of person with learned in scripture, who scrutinizes meaning of ***Pāli*** Text and commentary. It means remorse can not also arise in the continuum of mind of that practicing ***bhikkhu***, due to both performing  practices  in  accordance  with  noble  three  trainings,  called  virtue, concentration, wisdom in sequence and atoning for sin in accordance with Monastic Codes. (***Mūlaṭī***-***2-159***) 
1. The ***bhikkhu*** who usually enquires over and over, what the matter which should be done or not; what the matter which should be said or not, also can discard hindrance of distraction-remorse. 
1. Due to occurrence of learned in Monastic Codes; due to well practiced in Monastic Codes, the practicing person who is mastery in principle of Monastic Codes called ***vinaya*** ***dhamma***, also can discard hindrance of distraction-remorse. 
1. The practicing person  who  has  association  with  famous  and  virtuous  elder ***Māha*** ***Theras***, also can discard hindrance of distraction-remorse. (The occurrence of person who usually associates with elder ***Māha*** ***Theras*** can bring forth occurrence of the person  with  matured  morality  of  oneself  who  approaches  the  elder  ones.  It  can, therefore, bring forth tranquility of mind and the commentary expounds that it can discard  distraction-remorse.  Furthermore  \_\_\_  it  should  be  recognized  the commentator Sayadaw explained those ***bhikkhus*** who are learned in Monastic Codes and are capable of discarding remorse, without considerating on elder  or not, are called good friends (***kalyāṇamitta***). 
5. The practicing person who associates with virtuous good friends who are learned in Monastic Codes like Venerable ***Upāli*** ***Māha*** ***Thero***, also can discard hindrance of distraction-remorse.  (Because  every  person  who  is  learned  in  Monastic  Codes  is, really, capable of discarding remorse, he is good friend even though he is not elder one. Therefore good friends are expounded as specific factor.) 
5. Hindrance  of  distraction-remorse  can  be  discarded  through  pertinent  ***dhamma*** preaching relating to about what is conformed with ***dhamma*** or not in four kinds of deportments, i.e., reclining, sitting, standing, walking. 

Therefore  it  was  expounded  that  (6)  kinds  of  ***dhammas***  are  factors  of  discarding hindrance of distraction-remorse. He distinguishes clearly on the nature of absolute cessation of hindrance of distraction-remorse, which has been discarded by these (6) factors, without reappearing in future through the Path-Knowledge of arahant. (= he must endeavour in order to know clearly that nature.) (***Abhi-A-2-261***) 

**PAGE-526 (V) 50. Origin of hindrance of skeptical doubt (*vicikicchā*)** 

Hindrance of skeptical doubt arises apparently, due to improper way of taking into heart (unwise attention) ***dhammas*** which are factors of existing of skeptical doubt, in the next method, ***dhammas*** with skeptical doubt which can exist, through non-factor of availability of prosperities, the Path-Knowledge, Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna*** etc. Those words, ***vicikicchā*** ***ṭhānīya***  ***dhamma***  (***dhammas***  which  are  factors  of  existing  of  skeptical  doubt),  means preceding  skeptical  doubt  which  arises  over  and  over,  due  to  occurrence  of  origin  of succeeding skeptical doubt. In the continuum of mind of person who brings forth improper way of taking into heart (unwise attention) on those ***vicikicchā*** ***ṭhānīya*** ***dhamma*** over and over  through  non-factor  of  availability  of  prosperities,  the  Path-Knowledge,  Fruit- Knowledge, ***nibbāna*** etc, hindrance of skeptical doubt arises apparently. The Exalted One, therefore, preached as follows:\_\_\_\_ 

***Bhikkhus***…… there are ***dhammas*** which are existing factors of skeptical doubt, in the next method, preceding skeptical doubt with skeptical doubt which can exist; there are also frequent practices of improper way of taking into heart (=unwise attention) on those ***vicikicchā***  ***ṭhānīya***  ***dhamma***  through  non-factor  of  availability  of  prosperities,  the  Path- Knowledge,  Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna***  etc.,  these  frequent practices  of  improper  way  of taking into heart are factors of both apparent arising of skeptical doubt which has not arisen and proliferation and plenty of skeptical doubt which has arisen. (***Sam-3-91; Abhi-A-2-261***) 

**(V) 51. Factors of discarding hindrance of skeptical doubt** 

Ability to discard that hindrance of skeptical doubt arises, due to proper way of taking into heart (= wise attention) ***dhammas***, wholesome deed etc., through factor of availability of prosperities,  the  Path-Knowledge,  Fruit-Knowledge,  ***nibbāna***  etc.  The  Exalted  One, therefore, preached as follows:\_\_\_\_ 

“***Bhikkhus***…….. there are wholesome ***dhammas***, unwholesome ***dhammas***; ***dhammas*** with fault, ***dhammas*** without fault; ***dhammas*** which are worth subsisting, ***dhammas*** which are not worth subsisting; inferior ***dhammas***, superior ***dhammas***; ***dhammas*** with the same allotment of dirty ***dhammas***, ***dhammas*** with the same allotment of purified ***dhammas***. There are frequent practices of proper way of taking into heart (wise attention) on those ***dhammas***, wholesome deeds, unwholesome deeds etc. through factor of availability of prosperities, the Path-Knowledge, Fruit-Knowledge, ***nibbāna*** etc. These frequent practices of proper way of taking into heart are for the sake of non-arising of hindrance of sceptical doubt which has not yet arisen and for the sake of discarding hindrance of sceptical doubt which has arisen. (***San- 3-93, M-A-1-290***) 

**PAGE-527 (V) .52. Next method \_\_\_\_ (6) factors of discarding hindrance of sceptical doubt** 

These (6) kinds of ***dhammas***, viz. 

7. occurrence of the person with great general knowledge, 
7. occurrence of the person who usually enquires over and over, 
7. occurrence of the person who knows principle of Monastic Codes (***vinaya***); 
7. occurrence of the person who usually has numerous decisions, 
7. occurrence  of  the  person  who  has  got  association  with  good  teacher  and  good friends, 
7. occurrence of the person who has pertinent ***dhamma*** preaching relating to factors of discarding hindrance of sceptical doubt, 

are for the sake of discarding hindrance of sceptical doubt. (***Abhi-A-2-262***) 

1. Due to occurrence of the person with great general knowledge, the person who learns any part of the five parts of ***Sutta*** ***Pitaka*** called ***Nikāya*** or all parts of ***Nikāya*** through either ***Pāli*** Text or commentary, also can discard hindrance of sceptical doubt. 
1. The person, who usually enquires over and over about relating to Triple  Gems, also can discard hindrance of sceptical doubt. (***Abhi-A-2-262***) 

Due to presence of above two factors, these kinds of  

1) sceptical doubt which has (8) kinds of depended bases (Those have already explained in section of mental concomitant, ***vicikicchā***.) 
1) sceptical doubt which has (16) kinds of depended bases (Those will be explicit in section of dependent-origination, Volume III.) 

can be discarded really. Although those sceptical doubts can be discarded in that way, every sceptical doubt, excluding sceptical doubt on Noble Triple Gems, has foundation of sceptical doubt  on  Noble  Triple  Gems.  Unless  one  believes  the  Buddha,  he  believes  neither  the Buddha’s ***dhammas*** nor Noble ***saṅghā*** who are disciples of the Exalted One. Unless Triple Gems are believed, Noble three trainings called virtue, concentration, wisdom are also not believed; neither past life, future life, past future lives nor principles of dependent-origination are believed; it should be understood in this way etc. The commentary, therefore, explained emphatically sceptical doubt on Noble Triple Gems only. (***Mūlaṭī-2-160***) 

3. Due to occurrence of learned in Monastic Codes; due to well practiced in Monastic Codes, the practicing person who is mastery in principle of Monastic Codes called ***vinayadhamma***,  also  can  discard  hindrance  of  sceptical  doubt,  which  had  been preached that  “***sikkhāya kankhati*** = sceptical doubt arises on three trainings, virtue, concentration, wisdom”. (***Abhi-A-2-262***) 

**PAGE-528** 

4. The person who has got numerous, out and out decisions in such way that “it is real Buddha! it is real ***dhamma***! It is real ***saṅghā***! Through firm faith which is capable of believing  on  attributes  of  Triple  Gems,  (***saddhādhimokkha***)  also  can  discard hindrance  of  sceptical  doubt.  (  In  order  to  discard  in  that  way,  Meditation  on Recollection  of  the  Supreme  Buddha  etc.,  are  worth  developing  over  and  over.) (***Abhi-A-2-262***) 
4. The person who associates with virtuous good friends who have got firm faith on Triple Gems like the Venerable ***Vakkali*** ***Māha*** ***Thero***, also can discard hindrance of sceptical doubt. (***Abhi-A-2-262***) 
4. Hindrance  of  distraction-remorse  can  be  discarded  through  pertinent  ***dhamma*** preaching relating to about relating to Noble Attributes of Triple Gems in four kinds of deportments, i.e. 

reclining, sitting, standing, walking. 

Therefore  it  was  expounded  that  (6)  kinds  of  ***dhammas***  are  factors  of  discarding hindrance of sceptical doubt. He distinguishes clearly on the nature of absolute cessation of hindrance  of  sceptical  doubt,  which  has  been  discarded  by  these  (6)  factors,  without reappearing  in  future  through  the  Path-Knowledge  of  Upstream-enterer.  (=  he  must endeavour in order to know clearly that nature.) (***Abhi-A-2-262***) 

Essence of way of discerning \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

Essence of above explanations are as follows: \_\_\_\_\_\_ 

1. If five kinds of hindrances are present apparently in one’s continuum of mind, he has to discern in order to know “it is present apparently”. 
1. If five kinds of hindrances are not present apparently in one’s continuum of mind, he has to discern in order to know “it is not present apparently”. 
1. Origins of hindrance ***dhammas*** must also be known, as they really are. 
1. Factors of cessation of hindrance ***dhammas*** also be known, as they really are. 

In  this  case,  proximate  cause  of  arising  of  hindrances  is,  really,  unwise  attention (***ayonisomanasikāra***). Proximate cause of cessation of hindrances, which is worth fulfilled previously before the Noble Path is reached, is wise attention (***yonisomanasikāra***). It has been explained on what is unwise attention and what is wise attention in previous sections. Therefore the righteous ***meditator*** 

1. must endeagour in order to know five kinds of hindrances, as they really are; 
1. must endeavour in order to know five aggregates, including five kinds of hindrances, which are real ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***, ***asubha***, as they really are. 

**PAGE-529** 

3. must perform  ***vipassanā***  discerning  continuously  through  discerning  on  those  five aggregates, corporeal and mental ***dhammas***,together with causal ***dhammas*** as ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***, ***a-subha***. 

These are essence of way of discerning on hindrances. Although it is said as Section on Hindrances, pure hindrance ***dhammas*** must not be discerned but five aggregates must also be discerned together with the former. In this first stage, five aggregates, including five kinds of  hindrances  must  be  kept  in  mind  in  order  to  distinguish  clearly.  Way  of  ***vipassanā*** discerning will be explicit in Section of ***Vipassanā*** Practice, **Volume V**.

Ways of keeping five kinds of aggregates, corporeal and mental ***dhammas*** in mind through  characteristic-function-manifestation-proximate  cause  without  any  remain  will  be presented in Section of ***Lakkhaṇādicatukka,* Volume IV**. In accordance with explanation, “***rūpam  sabhāvato  pajānāti***”  (***Dī-A-2-373,  M-A-1-291***),  found  in  commentary,  ways  of keeping five kinds of aggregates in mind  have been presented until present section in order to reach the ultimate nature called specific character by insight. 

**(V) 55. *iti rūpassa samudayo, iti rūpassa atthangamo Pāli Quotation (Dī-A-2-373; M-A-1-291)*** 

If one can scrutinize and discern these phenomena, viz, 

1. due to past causal ***dhammas*** called ***avijjā-taṇhā-upādāna-saṅkhāra-kamma***, in other words, due to presence of causal ***dhammas*** which had been accomplished in previous existences, how ***kammaja*** ***rūpa*** arise apparently; 
1. due to arising of mind, how ***cittajarūpa*** arise apparently; 
1. due to presence of temperature, how ***utujarūpa*** arise apparently; 
1. due to presence of nutriment, how ***āhārajarūpa*** arise apparently; 
1. nature  of  arising  called  ***nibbatti  lakkhaṇā***  of  those  ***kammajarūpa***,  ***cittajarūpa***, ***utujarūpa***, ***āhārajarūpa***; with the help of insight, it can be said that he sees the nature of factors of arising and the nature of arising of corporeal ***dhammas***. 

If one can scrutinize and discern these phenomena, viz, 

1. due to absolute cessation called ***anuppādanirodha*** of causal ***dhammas***, i.e., ***avijjā***- ***taṇhā***-***upādāna***-***saṅkhāra***-***kamma***,  through  the  Path-Knowledge  of  Arahant,  how ***kammaja***  ***rūpa***  cease  absolutely  without  reappearing  in  future  with  ***anuppāda*** ***nirodha***, after final death of Arahant, 
1. due to cessation of mind, how ***cittajarūpa*** cease; 
1. due to cessation of temperature, how ***utujarūpa*** cease; 
1. due to cessation of nutriment, how ***āhārajarūpa*** cease; 
1. the  nature  of  alteration  (***vipariṇāma  lakkahṇā***)  called  perishing  phase (***bhangakkhaṇa***) of those ***kammajarūpa***, ***cittajarūpa***, ***utujarūpa***, ***āhārajarūpa***; with the help of insight, it can be said he sees nature of     factors of cessation and nature of cessation of corporeal ***dhammas***. 

It should be recognized similarly on feeling aggregate etc. (Detailed account will be seen in section of Dependent-Origination and Section of ***Vipassanā*** Practice.) 

**PAGE-533** 

**(V)56 Questions which are worth asking**  

If  the  righteous  ***meditator***  has  got  experiences  of  either  ***samatha***  or  ***vipassanā*** practice, he should like to ask himself the following questions. 

1. Can  I  keep  “(28)  kinds of corporealities” in mind through  characteristic-function- manifestation-proximate cause? 
1. Can I keep “both (52) mental concomitants and (6) kinds of consciousness elements” in mind through characteristic-function-manifestation-proximate cause? 
1. Can I keep these phenomena in mind, viz., 

Due to respective causal ***dhammas*** called ***avijjā***-***taṇhā***-***upādāna***-***saṅkhāra***-***kamma***, how resultant corporeality-mentality arise; due to cessation of causal ***dhammas*** ***avijjā***- ***taṇhā***-***upādāna***-***saṅkhāra***-***kamma***,  how  resultant  corporeality-mentality  cease;  and nature of arising and perishing away of both kinds of causality and results, as they really are? 

If one can answer that “no”, he should like to endeavour in order to answer as “yes”, in the aspect of this paper. It is because the Exalted One, himself preached in ***Aparijāñāṇa*** ***Sutta*** that “only when all kinds of corporeality-mentality are known and seen through three kinds  of  full  understanding  (***pariññā***),  can  one  extinguish  suffering  of  rounds  of  rebirth (***samsāra***)”. Every virtuous person has to endeavour especially so as not to miss the Noble Admonishment  of  the  Exalted  One,  which  had  been  cultivated  through  scrutinizing  and discriminating  efficiency  of  Knowledge  of  Omni-science,  which  had  been  acquired  after fulfilling with ten kinds of perfections called ***pāramita*** with (30) varieties throughout four ***asankheyya*** and hundred thousands aeons (***kappa***). 

**(V)57  First stage of section on Twelve Sense-Bases *Pāli Quotation (M-1-78, 79)*** 

- And again, ***bhikkhus***, the ***bhikkhu*** discerns steadfastly on natural phenomena of the 

(6) internal and the (6) external sense-bases. ***Bhikkhus***….. how does the ***bhikkhu*** discern steadfastly on the (6) internal and the (6) external sense-bases? 

**PAGE-534** 

***Bhikkhus***, the ***bhikkhu*** following my Teaching distinguishes eye-transparent-element through specific character as it really is; He distinguishes external visible-objects also which are produced by four factors called ***kamma***-***citta***-***utu-āhāra***, through specific character, as they really are. 

He distinguishes arising of (10) kinds of fetters (***samyojana***) depending on both kinds of eye-transparent-element and visible-object. Besides, he distinguishes not only factors of arising of a fetter which has not yet arisen but also factors of discarding the fetter which has arisen. He distinguishes absolute cessation of discarded fetter also without reappearing in future (= factors of absolute cessation through ***anuppāda*** ***nirodha***). (***M-1-78, 79***) 

Remaining  sense-bases  and  object,  ear-base  and  audible-object,  nose-base  and olfactory-object etc., were also preached in similar way. 

**(V) 58 Way of distinguishing (*pajānāti*) *Palil Quotation (M-A-1-292) (M-tī-1-378)*** 

Eye-transparent-element has got the function of attracting continuity of consciousness of eye-door-cognitive process, including seeing-consciousness, towards visible-object. It has got the specific character of cleansing four great elements which are worth striking of visible- object. 

Visible-object has got the function of arising as object of seeing-consciousness. It has got specific character of striking towards eye-transparent-element. 

Thus every ultimate element has got specific character and specific function. Only when each specific character and each specific function can be discerned discriminately, can it be said “one distinguishes that ultimate nature”. Therefore the virtuous ***meditator*** should like  to  understand  the  fact  it  can  not  be  said  “this  way  of  discerning  concerns  with  all phenomena as water follows buffalo that swims”. 

**(V) 59  Factors of arising and discarding *Pāli Quotation (M-Tī-1-379)*** 

**PAGE-535** 

As mentioned in section on hindrances improper way of taking into heart (= unwise attention)  on  (6)  kinds  of  objects,  which  are  capable  of  showing  ***subhanimitta, paṭighanimitta*** etc., which are so called desirable object, undesirable object etc., is proximate cause for arising of (10) kinds of fetters…… R……. Similarly \_\_\_\_\_ wise attention which is so called ***samatha***, ***vipassanā*** practices, on the other hand, is proximate cause for discarding on (10) kinds of fetters. 

Way of discerning on how (10) kinds of fetters arise depending on unwise attention has already been presented previously. If the righteous ***meditator*** wants to discard (10) kinds of fetters, he must endeavour in order to know and see penetratively on (12) sense-bases and then he must bring forth proper way of taking into heart (=wise attention) which is capable of discerning on those (12) sense-bases as ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta*** over and over throughout day and night continuously. If one endeavours in that way successive Noble Path-Knowledge and Fruit-Knowledge will arise at the end of matured ***vipassanā*** knowledge. Those Four Kinds of Noble Path-Knowledge will eradicate (10) kinds of fetters so as to cease without reappearing in future as follows.\_\_\_\_ 

**(V) 60 *anuppādanirodha* (absolute cessation without reappearing in future)** 

1. These five kinds of mental fetters, personality wrong view, sceptical doubt, rule and rite, jealousy, stinginess, are eradicated by ***sotāpatti magga ñāṇa*** absolutely. Those fetters cease without reappearing in future through ***sotāpatti*** ***magga*** ***ñāṇa***. 
1. These two kinds of gross mental fetters, craving for sensual pleasure and hatred, are eradicated  by  ***sakadāgāmi***  ***maggañāṇa***  absolutely.  Those  fetters  cease  without reappearing in future through ***sakadāgāmi magga*** ***ñāṇa***. 
3. These two kinds of subtle mental fetters, craving for sensual pleasure and hatred, are eradicated  by  ***anāgāmi***  ***magga  ñāṇa***  absolutely.  Those  fetters  cease  without reappearing in future through ***anāgāmi*** ***magga*** ***ñāṇa***. 
3. These  three  kinds  of  mental  fetters,  conceit,  craving  on  existence,  ignorance,  are eradicated  by  ***arahatta***  ***magga  ñāṇa***  absolutely.  Those  fetters  cease  without reappearing in future through ***arahatta magga*** ***ñāṇa***.

- And again, ***bhikkhus***, the ***bhikkhu*** discerns steadfastly on the natural phenomena of 

the Seven  Factors of Enlightenment (***bojjhanga***). And, ***bhikkhus***, how does the ***bhikkhu*** discern steadfastly on the seven Factors of Enlightenment? 

***Bhikkhus***….. the ***bhikkhu*** following my Teaching distinguishes “***satisambojjhanga*** is present apparently in me”, if ***satisambojjhanga*** (= mindfulness factor of enlightenment) is present  in   him;  or  he  distinguishes  that  “***satisambojjhanga***  is  not  present  in  me’,  if ***satisambojjhanga*** is not present in him. Besides, he distinguishes not only factors of arising of  ***satisambojjhanga***  which  has  not  yet  arisen  but  also  factors  of  accomplishment  of developing ***satisambojjhanga***. (***M-1-80***) 

Remaining factors of enlightenment, ***dhammavicāya*** (wisdom), ***vīriya*** (=effort), ***pīiti*** (bliss), ***passaddhi*** (=tranquility), ***Samādhi*** (=concentration), ***upekkhā*** (neutrality) were also preached in similar ways. There are (7) factors of enlightenment in total.

2) the effort which is capable of endeavouring in order to know penetratively causal ***dhammas*** of those five kinds of clinging aggregates; 

**PAGE-537** 

3) the effort which is capable of endeavouring in order to know penetratively nature of ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***, ***asubha*** of those five kinds of clinging aggregates together with causal ***dhammas***; are designated as mundane effort factor of enlightenment. It is the effort which associates with ***vipassanā*** knowledge.

It is the bliss which associates with ***vipassanā*** knowledge. 
1) The  bliss  which  associates  with  the  Noble  Path-Knowledge  is  designated  as Supramundane bliss factor of enlightenment.  
5. These various kinds of tranquility, viz., 
1) the  tranquility  of  consciousness  and  mental  concomitants  which  arises  during penetrative knowing on five kinds of clinging aggregates called ***kāya-vedanā***-***citta***- ***dhamma***  which  associate  with  those  mindfulness-wisdom-effort-bliss  factors  of enlightenment,

1) the  tranquility  of  consciousness  and  mental  concomitants  which  arises  during penetrative knowing nature of ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***, ***asubha*** of those five kinds of clinging  aggregates  together  with  causal  ***dhammas***;  are  designated  as  mundane tranquillity factor of enlightenment. 
1) The tranquillity which associates with the Noble Path-Knowledge is designated as Supramundane tranquillity factor of enlightenment. 
6. These various kinds of concentration, viz., 
1) the concentration which is stability on object of five kinds of clinging aggregates called ***kāya***-***vedanā***-***citta***-***dhamma*** which associate with those mindfulness-wisdom- effort-bliss-tranquility factors of enlightenment;

[Notes:\_\_\_\_\_ Access concentration full concentration which are obtained through ***samatha*** practices are also known as mundane concentration factor of enlightenment. 

4) The concentration which associates with the Noble Path-Knowledge is designated as Supramundane concentration factor of enlightenment. 
7. These various kinds of ***bojjhanguppekkhā***,viz., 
1) the  ***bojjhanguppekkhā***  which  is  capable  of  balancing  consciousness  and  mental concomitants which are arising together with itself on the object of five kinds of clinging aggregates called ***kāya***-***vedanā***-***citta***-***dhamma*** which associate with those (6) factors of enlightenment in order to exist in the medium condition; 
1) the  ***bojjhanguppekkhā***  which  is  capable  of  balancing  consciousness  and  mental concomitants which are arising together with itself on the object of causal ***dhammas*** of those five kinds of clinging aggregates in order to exist in the medium condition; 
1) ***bojjhanguppekkhā*** = ***vipassanāuppekkhā*** = ***saṅkhārupekkhā*** (= neutrality towards formations) which is capable of balancing consciousness and mental concomitants which are arising together with itself on the object of  nature of ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***,  ***asubha***  of  those  five  kinds  of  clinging  aggregates  together  with  causal ***dhammas***; are designated as mundane equanimity factor of enlightenment. The basic meaning is the  mental  concomitant called ***tatramajjhattata*** (= equanimity) (Those ***jhānuppekkhā***  which  is  the  equanimity  associating  with  third  absorption  and ***parisuddhuppekkhā*** which is the equanimity associating with fourth absorption are also known as mundane equanimity factor of enlightenment.) 
1) The ***tatramajjhattatā***(= equanimity) which associates with the Noble Path-Knowledge is  designated  as  Supramundane  ***tatramajjhattatā***  (=  equanimity)  factor  of enlightenment. 

The  virtuous  practicing  person  has  to  fulfill  (7)  kinds  of  mundane  factors  of enlightenment in order to accomplish Supra-mundane factors of enlightenment. For instance \_\_\_\_\_ 

In these impulsions of mind-door-cognitive processes which know the eye-transparent element 

1. as corporeal ***dhamma***; 
1. as eye-transparent-element; 
1. as ***anicca***; 
1. as ***dukkha***; 
1. as ***anatta***, 
1. as ***asubha***, 

There are (34) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** respectively, (if both knowledge and ***pīti*** associate with it). Seven kinds of mundane factors of enlightenment called mindfulnessj- wisdom-effort-bliss-tranquillity-concentration-equanimity in those mental ***dhammas***. 

If one can discern and keep those mental ***dhammas***, including those (7) kinds of mundane factors of enlightenment, in mind up to field of ultimate nature through breaking down compactness of mentality (***nāmaghana***), it can be said “one knows that (7) factors of enlightenment are present in me”, if those factors of enlightenment are present apparently in him. Unless one can discern those mental ***dhammas***, including \*7) factors of enlightenment, up to the field of ultimate nature, it can be said one knows that “(7) kinds of factors of enlightenment are lacking in me”. 

**PAGE-539 (V) 62 *bojjhanga* = factor of enlightenment** 

At the Noble Path (=moment) harmonious arising of those (7) kinds of factors of enlightenment is called ***dhamma*** ***sāmaggī*** (=united ***dhammas***). 

Among those factors, those united ***dhammas*** predominated with wisdom, effort, bliss are opposite of …….. 

1. laziness which draws back from object of practice (***līna***-***dhamma***) = continuity of unwholesome consciousness predominated with indolence, 
1. standstill  in  both  present  life  and  ***samsāra***  by  means  of  defilements,  in  the  next method, standstill by means of craving (= ***paṭiṭṭhānadhamma***); (=It means existing in any life through craving without struggling for liberation.), 
1. repeated  trying  for  sensual  pleasure  through  attaching  sensual  pleasure  (=extreme practice of self-indulgence called ***kāmasukhallikanuyoga***), 
1. adherence  due  to  annihilation  view  (***uccheda  abhinivesa***)  which  is  capable  of improper way of taking into heart as “life means only the period between cradle and coffin; every one annihilates after death; there is nothing beyond coffin”. 

Those  united  ***dhammas***  predominated  with  tranquility,  concentration,  equanimity  [= harmonious arising (7) kinds of factors of enlightenment are opposite of….. 

1. distraction from object of practice ( = ***uddhacca***), 
1. accumulation (***āyūhana***) of wholesome ***kamma***-formations, unwholesome ***kamma***- formations, unshakable ***kamma*** formations (***āneñjābhi saṅkhāra*** which are capable of  providing  next  coming-into-existence  again  and  again,  in  the  next  method, accumulation through wrong view, 
1. extreme practice of self mortification (***attakilamathānuyoga***), 
1. adherence due to eternity view (= ***sassata abhinivesa***) which is capable of taking into heart as “***atta*** is eternal; it never annihilate but transfers one after another life again and again. 

At the Noble Path (-moment)  collection of those harmonious arising (7) kinds of ***dhammas***  are  called  ***bodhi***  (enlightenment).  Any  part  of  united  ***dhammas***,  which  are harmonious  arising  and  called  enlightenment,  is  designated  as  ***bojjhanga***  (factor  of enlightenment). The essence is as follows: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

The Noble Disciple who has got united ***dhammas*** called mindfulness, wisdom, effort, bliss, tranquility, concentration, equanimity, which are opposite of above oppressive dangers, laziness, distraction etc., which arise at the Supra-mundane Path(-moment)\_\_\_\_\_ 

1. can awake from sleeping called continuity of defilements. 
1. In the next method, he can awaken to Four Noble Truths. 
1. In the next method, he can realize ***nibbāna*** called ***nirodhasacca*** penetratively through perceiving directly. 

**PAGE-540** 

Those united ***dhammas*** (***dhammasāmaggī***) are designated as ***bodhi*** (enlightenment). Any  part  of  those  harmonious  arising  united  ***dhammas***  called  ***bodhi***  is  called  factor  of enlightenment  (***bojjhanga***).  It  should be  recognized  similarly  as  some  usages, ***jhānaga***  ( factors of absorption), ***magganga*** (factors of Path) etc. 

As collection of five factors of absorption are called ***jhāna*** (absorption) and then each part of absorption can be called ***jhānaga*** (factor of absorption); as collection of eight factors of Path are called ***magga*** (= the Path) and then each part of Path can be called ***magga***nga (factor  of  Path),  similarly  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_  in  accordance  with  explanation,  “  ***bodhiyā  ango bojjhango***,” each part of united ***dhammas*** called collection of seven factors of enlightenment, mindfulness etc., is called factor of enlightenment; it means thus. (***Abhi-A-1-262; Abhi-A-2- 296***) 

***bodhissa vā ango bojjhango*** 

In the next method \_\_\_\_ The Noble Disciple (***ariyāsāvaka***) can also be designated as ***bodhi***, due to capable of knowing Four Noble Truths through coincident arising of these (7) kinds of ***dhammas***. Due to occurrence of part of that Noble Disciple called ***bodhi***, it is called factor  of  enlightenment.  As  any  part  of  army  called  ***sena***,  elephant-troop  etc.,  is  called ***senanga***; as any part of horse drawn coach (***gharry***), shaft, axle etc., is called ***rathanga***, mindfulness etc. which arises in the continuity of the corporeality-mentality of Noble One called ***bodhi*** can be called ***bojjhanga***, (factor of enlightenment), due to occurrence of part of that continuity of corporeality-mentality. 

***bodhāya samvaṭṭantīti bojjhangā*** 

- Due to occurrence of factors of knowing Four Noble Truths, (7) kinds of ***dhammas***, 

mindfulness etc., are called ***bojjhanga***. 

***bujjhantīti bojjhangā*** 

- Due to capable of knowing Four Noble Truths, (7) kinds of ***dhammas***, mindfulness 

etc., are called ***bojjhanga***. Those ***bodhi*** only are called ***bojjhanga***. (***bodhi*** and ***anga*** have the same meaning.) 

***anubujjhantīti bojjhangā*** 

- Due to capable of knowing various ***dhammas***,i.e., ***vipassanā*** knowledge, the Path-

Knowledge, the Fruit-Knowledge etc., which are worth knowing appropriately , in the next method, \_\_\_\_\_ due to capable of knowing Four Noble Truths ***dhammas*** appropriately, which are worth knowing, those are called ***bojjhanga***. 

***paṭibujjhantīti*** ***bojjhanga*** 

=Due to capable of leading towards and knowing  Four Noble Truths, in the next method, ***nibbāna***  through  direct perceiving,  those ***dhammas***,  mindfulness  etc.,  are  called ***bojjhanga***. 

***Sambujjahantīti*** ***bojjhangā***  

- Due to capable of knowing Four Noble Truths, in the next method, ***nibbāna***, as they 

really are, those (7) kinds of ***dhammas***, mindfulness etc., are called ***bojjhanga***. (***Paṭisam - 302; Abhi-A-1-262***) 

**PAGE-541** 

It should be recognized factors of arising of ***bojjhanga*** as mentioned in Section on ***ānāpānassati samādhi***, Volume I. Among those factors, in accordance with the preaching, “***tattha  yonisomanasikāra  bahulīkāro,  ayamāhāro***”  (***Sam-3-60***)  by  the  Exalted  One,  the proper  way  of  taking  into  heart  (=  wise  attention)  through  factors  of  availability  of prosperities,  the  Path-Knowledge,  Fruit-Knowledge,  ***nibbāna***  etc.,  is  proximate  cause  for arising of (7) factors of enlightenment. Repeated performing proper way of taking into heart (= wise attention) on five aggregates, wholesome ***dhammas***, unwholesome ***dhammas*** etc, as ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***, ***asubha***, is not only the factor for arising of (7) kinds of factors of enlightenment which has not yet arisen but also the factor for accomplishment of (7) kinds of factors of enlightenment up to up to the Path-Knowledge of Arahant.

***Pāli Quotation (M-1-82)*** 

And again, ***bhikkhus***, the ***bhikkhu*** discerns steadfastly on the natural phenomena of the Four Noble Truths. And, ***bhikkhus***, how does the ***bhikkhu*** discern steadfastly on the Four Noble Truths? 

***Bhikkhus***….., the ***bhikkhu*** following  my Teaching distinguishes  “This  is ***dukkha*** ***ariya*** ***sacca***, as it really is; he distinguishes “This is the origin of ***dukkha*** called ***samudaya*** ***ariya*** ***sacca***”, as it really is; he distinguishes “This is the cessation of ***dukkha*** called ***nirodha ariya*** ***sacca***”, as it really is; he distinguishes “This is the way of practice leading to the cessation of ***dukkha*** called ***nibbāna*** (= ***dukkhanirodhagāmini*** ***paṭipadā*** ) = ***magga*** ***ariya*** ***sacca***”, as it really is. (***M-1-82***)

* ***samkhittena pañcupādānakkhandhā dukkhā.* (*Abhi-2-104; M-1-82*)** 

If it is said in brief, five kinds of clinging aggregates, which are objects of taints ***dhammas***; which are obsessed through craving-wrong view as “I, mine”; which are existing in (11) modes of situations, past, future, present, internal, external etc., are the Noble Truth of ***dukkha***.  

**PAGE-542 (V) 65 *dukkhasamudaya* *ariya*scca (= the Noble Truth of the Origin of *dukkha*) *Pāli Quotation (Abhi-2-106; M-1-84)* 2 paragraphs *(Abhi-A-2-104) ( Mūlaṭī-2-69)*** 

1. ***kāmataṇhā*** (sensuous-craving) 

The  craving  which  has  got  heartfelt  desire  on  five  sensual  objects,  is  called ***kāmataṇhā***. It is the name of ***rāga*** (lust). 

2. ***bhavataṇhā*** (existence-craving) 
1) The craving which has got heartfelt desire on sensual existence, which arises by means of craving for sensual existence, is also called ***bhavataṇhā***. 
1) After accepting eternity wrong view that “***atta*** is eternal”, the craving which likes that view, is also called ***bhavataṇhā***. 
1) The craving, which has got heartfelt desire on fine material existence, immaterial existence,  which  is  worth  designating  as  ***rūparāga***,  ***arūparāga***,  is  also  called ***bhavataṇhā***. 
1) The craving which is called ***jhananikanti*** (attachment on absorption), which is factor of arising of fine material existence, immaterial existence, is also called ***bhavataṇhā***. 
3. ***vibhavataṇhā*** (non-existence craving) 

The wrong view on self that “the self is impermanent; it annihilates after death”, is called ***vibhava***. The wrong view which obsesses on ***attavāda*** called that ***vibhava*** is called ***ucchedadiṭṭhi*** (= annihilation view) = ***vibhavadiṭṭhi*** (= non-existence view). The craving; which  attaches  strongly  on  that  annihilation  view  (=  non-existence  view);  which  arises together with annihilation view (= non-existence view) is called ***vibhavataṇhā*** (non-existence craving). (***Abhi-A-2-104, Mūlaṭī-2-69***) 

This is accomplished through preaching methodology of **suttanta** (***suttantabhājanīya naya***.) In the aspect of preaching methodology of ***abhidhamma*** ( ***abhi-dhammabhājanīya naya***), there are five kinds of ***samudaya*** ***sacca***, as follows:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

**PAGE-543 (V) 66 *Abhidhammabhājanīya* method** 

***Pāli Quotation (Abhi-2-112) (Abhi-2-113) ( Abhi-2-114) 2 paragraphs (Abhi-2-115)*** 

1. Every kind of craving is called ***samudaya*** ***sacca***. 
1. All kinds of defilements, together with craving, are also called ***samudaya*** ***sacca***. 
1. These  ***dhammas***,  (a)  craving  (b)  defilements,  excluding  craving,  (c)  all unwholesome ***dhammas***, excluding craving, defilements, are also called ***samudaya*** ***sacca***. 
1. These  ***dhammas***,  (a)  craving  (b)  defilements,  excluding  craving,  (c)  all unwholesome  ***dhammas***,  excluding  craving,  defilements,  (d)  three  kinds  of wholesome rooted ***dhammas*** called greedlessness, non-hatred, non-delusion, which are objects of taints ***dhammas***, are also called ***samudaya*** ***sacca***. 
1. These  ***dhammas***,  (a)  craving  (b)  defilements,  excluding  craving,  (c)  all unwholesome  ***dhammas***,  excluding  craving,  defilements,  (d)three  kinds  of wholesome rooted ***dhammas*** which are objects of taints ***dhammas***, (e) all kinds of wholesome ***dhammas***, excluding three kinds of wholesome rooted ***dhammas***, which are objects of taints ***dhammas***, are also called ***samudaya*** ***sacca***. ***(Abhi-2-112, 115)*** 

In accordance with above ***Pāli*** Text, the commentary called ***Sammohavinodani*** explains as follows: \_\_\_\_\_\_ 

***tattha yasamāh kusalākusalakammam avisesena samudayasaccanti saccavibhange vuttam. (Abhi-A-2-185)*** 

- Every wholesome action or every unwholesome action, which is the object of taints 

***dhammas*** (= depending on rounds called ***vaṭṭanissita***) can be designated as ***samudaya*** ***sacca***. (***Abhi-A-2-185***) 

**(V)67. Truth *dhammas* which are discerned objects of *vipassanā* knowledge** 

The two kinds of Noble Truth 

1. ***dukkhasacca*** ***dhammas*** called five kinds of clinging aggregates, 
1. ***samudaya*** ***sacca*** ***dhammas*** called wholesome action and unwholesome action, in the next  method  \_\_\_\_  ***samudaya***  ***sacca***  ***dhammas***  called  principle  of  dependent- origination, in accordance with ***Tiṭṭhāyatana Sutta,Tikanipāta, Anguttara Nikāya,*** are called ***vaṭṭasacca*** (Cyclic Noble Truths). 

**PAGE-544** 

These two kinds of Noble Truths, 

3. ***nirodhasacca*** ***dhamma*** called unconditioned element, Eternal Peace called ***nibbāna***, 
3. ***maggasacca***  ***dhamma***  called  (8)  bases  of  factors  of  Path  (***magganga***)  which  are associating with Noble Path-Knowledge, 

are called ***vivaṭṭasacca*** (Non-cyclic Noble Truths). 

* ***tesu bhikkhuno vaṭṭe kammaṭṭhānābhinive so hoti. Vivaṭṭe natthi abhiniveso. (Abhi-A-2- 109; Dī-A-2-391)*** 

In those two kinds of ***vaṭṭasacca*** and ***vivaṭṭasacca***, 

The practicing ***bhikkhu*** must perform ***vipassanā*** discerning on ***vaṭṭasacca*** ***dhammas*** but not ***vivaṭṭa*** ***sacca*** ***dhammas***. The righteous ***miditator*** must, therefore, endeavour previously in order to know ***dukkhasacca*** ***dhammas*** and ***samudaya*** ***sacca*** ***dhammas*** which are discerned objects of ***vipassanā*** practice. Now it has been presented on ways of keeping (5) kinds of present, internal clinging aggregates in mind in this paper. 

Both ways of keeping external non-living conditioned things in mind and way of keeping external living conditioned things (= five kinds of clinging aggregates) in mind will be presented continuously in this volume. Ways of keeping ***samudaya*** ***sacca*** ***dhammas*** in mind will be presented in Section of Dependent Origination, Volume III. Now it will be presented on ***nirodhasacca*** and ***maggasacca*** ***dhammas*** as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

**(V) 68 (a) *nirodhasacca* (Noble Truth of the Cessation of *dukkha*) *Pāli Quotation (M-1-86)*** 

- And  ***bhikkhus***,  what  is  the  Noble  Truth  of  the  Cessation  of  ***dukkha***?  Noble 

***dhamma*** called ***nibbāna*** which is absolute extinction and cessation of this very  craving; which is abandoning, discarding, liberation and detachment from craving, is called ***dukkha*** ***nirodha*** ***ariya*** ***sacca*** (Noble Truth of the Cessation of ***dukkha***). (***M-1-86***) 

**68 (b) Two kinds of *nirodha* (=cessation) *Pāli Qutoation (Vs-1-282)*** 

- Due to capable of abandoning defilements temporarily, ***vipassanā*** knowledge which 

arises by means of discerning incessant perishing phases (= momentary perishing phases) of conditioned things, is called ***virāga nupassanā***. 

Due to capable of ceasing defilements temporarily; due to occurrence of factor of ceasing defilements temporarily, it is also known as ***nirodhanupassanā***. 

Due to occurrence of factor of absolute freeing away and absolute ceasing of lust, the Noble Path which realizes penetratively ***nirodha*** ***sacca*** called unconditioned element, Eternal Peace, ***nibbāna***, is called not only ***virāganupassanā*** but also ***nirodhanupassanā***. 

If one can bring forth the in-breath and out-breath through fulfilling with ***vipassanā*** knowledge, the Path-Knowledge called those ***virāga***- 

***nupassanā***, ***nirodhanupassanā***, it should be recognized that he practices in order to bring forth the in-breath and out-breath through repeated discerning the nature of dispassion and the nature of cessation (= perishing phases of conditioned things and ***nibbāna***) over and over. (***Vs-1-282***) 

In above two kinds of dispassion (***virāga***) and two kinds of cessation, the practicing person has to endeavour in order to attain ***vipasssanā ñāṇa*** knowledge which can discern nature of ***khaya virāga, khaya nirodha*** of conditioned things beforehand. It is for the sake of attainment of the Noble Path which is capable of knowing and seeing unconditioned things, Eternal Peace, ***nibbāna*** which is called ***accantavirāga***, ***accantanirodha***. 

If the righteous ***miditator*** can discern the phenomenon that “due to absolute cessation of  causal  ***dhammas***,  ignorance-craving-clinging-formation-action  without  reappearing  in future  (***anuppāda***  ***nirodha***)  (through  efficiency  of  the  Path-Knowledge  of  Arahant),  the resultant  five  kinds  of  aggregates  cease  absolutely  without  reappearing  in  future (***anuppādanirodha***) with the help of ***vipassanā*** insight, that nature of cessation is mundane ***nirodhasacca***. The ***vipassanā*** knowledge which can discern  that  ***nirodhasacca***  is  mundane ***maggasacca***. (***Vs-2-267, 268***) 

***Pāli Quotation (Vs-2-269) (Vs-2-268)*** 

When  the  practicing  person  reaches  into  the  stage  of  Knowledge  of  Arising  and Passing Away\_\_\_\_ he has to discern through ***paccayato udayabbaya dassana***. 

1. ***paccayato udayabbaya dassana*** = way of discerning on the phenomena that “due to apparent  arising  of  causal ***dhammas***,  ignorance-craving-clinging-formations-action, the resultant five clinging aggregates arise apparently; and “due to absolute cessation of causal ***dhammas***, ignorance-craving-clinging-formation-action without reappearing in future (***anuppāda*** ***nirodha***) (through efficiency of the Path-Knowledge of Arahant), the resultant five kinds of aggregates cease absolutely without reappearing in future (***anuppādanirodha***) at the end of final death of Arahant, must be performed with the help of ***vipassanā*** insight. The knowledge which can discern in that way is called ***paccayato udayabbaya*** ***ñāṇa***, the knowledge which can discern phenomena of arising and perishing away through causal ***dhamma***. 

**PAGE-546** 

The ***vipassanā*** knowledge which can discern the phenomenon that “due to arising of causal ***dhammas***, the resultant ***dhammas*** arise”, is called ***paccayato udayadassana ñāṇa*** while the ***vipassanā*** knowledge which can discern the phenomenon that “due to cessation of causal ***dhammas***, the resultant ***dhammas*** cease” is called ***paccayato vayadassana ñāṇa***. 

Due  to  arising  of  ***paccayato  vayadassana  ñāṇa***,  ***nirodhasacca***  ***dhammas***  become apparent in the insight of practicing person. It is because he can know and see penetratively on the phenomenon that “due to absolute cessation of causal ***dhammas***, ignorance-craving- clinging-formation-action  without  reappearing  in  future  (***anuppāda***  ***nirodha***)  (through efficiency of the Path-Knowledge of Arahant), the resultant five kinds of aggregates cease absolutely  without  reappearing  in  future  (***anuppādanirodha***)  at  the  end  of  final  death  of Arahant with the help of experiential knowledge. (***Vs-2-267***) 

Absolute cessation of causal ***dhammas*** is called ***saupādisesanibbāna***, in other words, ***kilesaparinibbāna*** (extinguishment of defilements). Absolute cessation of resultant ***dhammas*** is called ***anupādisesa*** ***nibbāna***, in other words, ***khandha parinibbāna*** (extinguishment of aggregates). (***Abhi-A-2-413***) 

2. ***khaṇato udayabbayadassana*** 

The ***vipassanā*** knowledge,  which can discern phenomenon of arising and passing away  of  conditioned  things  until  reaching  into  momentary  present (***khaṇapaccuppanna***), is called ***khaṇato udayabbaya dassana ñāṇa***. 

These  two  kinds  of  knowledge,  ***paccayato  udayabbaya  ñāṇa  and  khaṇato udayabbayabbaya ñāṇa***, in the next method, group of ***dhammas*** which are predominated with  knowledge,  i.e.,  right  view,  right  thought,  right  effort,  right  mindfulness,  right concentration, are mundane ***magga*** ***sacca***. Due to capable of discarding delusion (***moha***) which is capable of covering on two kinds of phenomena called ***paccayato*** ***udayabbaya*** and ***khaṇato***  ***udayabbaya***  so  as  not  to  know,  temporarily,  those  ***dhammas***  are  called  ***magga sacca***. 

***Pāli Quotation (M-A-2-165)*** 

- The practicing person who does not know thoroughly purified Noble Eightfold Path 

in a way that “this is mundane ***maggasacca***; this is the Supra mundane ***magga*** ***sacca***”, as they really  are,  is  unable  to  arise  the  supra  mundane  ***magga***  ***sacca***  through  taking  into  heart mundane ***magga*** ***sacca*** ***dhammas***. ***(M-A-2-165)*** 

Therefore  the  righteous  ***meditator***  has  to  endeavour  in  order  to  know  mundane ***nirodhasacca***, the supra mundane ***nirodha*** ***sacca***; mundane ***magga*** ***sacca***, the supra mundane ***magga*** ***sacca***. 

Knowing  and  seeing  phenomenon  of  arising  of  conditioned  things,  until  reaching momentary  present,  through  ***vipassanā***  knowledge  is  knowing  and  seeing  on  ***jātidukkha*** (suffering  of  birth).  Knowing  and  seeing  phenomenon  of  perishing  away  of  conditioned things,  until  reaching  momentary  present  is  knowing  and  seeing  on  ***maraṇa***  ***dukkha***  (= suffering  of  death).  Those  ***jātidukkha***  and  ***maraṇadukkha***  are  mundane  ***dukkhasacca*** ***dhammas***. Furthermore \_\_\_ knowing and seeing on the phenomena that “due to apparent arising  of  causal  ***dhammas***,  ignorance-craving-clinging-formations-action,  resultant  five clinging aggregates arise apparently,” is knowing and seeing on mundane ***samudaya*** ***sacca***. (***Vs-2-267***) 

**PAGE-547** 

These mundane ***sukkhasacca*** and ***samudaya*** ***sacca*** must also be known penetratively for the sake of attainment of ***nibbāna*** for every practicing person. 

**(V) 69 *magga* *sacca* (= the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of *dukkha*)** 

These  (8)  factors  of purified  and  noble  Path,  i.e.,  right  view,  right  thought,  right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, are called ***magga*** ***ariyasacca*** which is called the way of practice leading to cessation of ***dukkha***, ***nibbāna***. 

Among those (8) factors,  

1. These three factors, i.e., right speech, right action, right livelihood are moral factors of Path; training of morality; morality practice. 
1. These  three  factors,  i.e.,  right  effort,  right  mindfulness,  right  concentration,  are concentration factors of Path; training of concentration; concentration practice. 
1. These two factors, i.e., right view, right thought, are wisdom factors of Path; training of wisdom; wisdom practice; 

Every virtuous ***meditator*** who is longing for ***nibbāna*** has to develop these three noble trainings called morality, concentration, wisdom in order. 

\1.  ***sammā*** ***diṭṭhi*** (right view) 

***Pāli Quotation (M-1-88)*** 

And, ***bhikkhus***, what is the Right View? 

1. Insight-knowledge which realizes ***dukkha*** ***sacca*** is called the Right View. 
2. Insight-knowledge which realizes ***samudaya*** ***sacca*** is called the Right View. 
2. Insight-knowledge which realizes ***nirodha*** ***sacca*** is called the Right View. 
2. Insight-knowledge which realizes ***magga*** ***sacca*** is called the Right View. The correct knowing and seeing in this way, ***bhikkhus***…., is called the Right View. (***M-1-88***) 

***Pāli Quotation (Di-A-2-392)*** 

Either through brief method in this way “five kinds of clinging aggregates are ***dukkha*** ***sacca***; the craving is ***samudaya*** ***sacca***” or through detailed method in this way “which are five  kinds  of  clinging  aggregates?  Those  are  ***rūpupādānakkhandhā,  vedanupā dānakkhandhā,  saññupādānakkhandhā,  saṅkhāru  pādānakkhandhā,  viññānupādānak khandhā***”, learning, repeated questioning, listening on ***dukkhasacca*** and ***samudaya*** ***sacca*** ***dhammas*** from teacher; reciting memorizing must also be performed previously. Afterwards that person must perform practices in order to know those ***dukkha*** ***sacca*** and ***samudaya*** ***sacca*** ***dhammas***. (***Di-A-2-391***) 

**PAGE-548** 

(Those person with an opinion that “it is no need to learn scriptures during performing ***vipassanā*** practice”, should like to notice this explanation carefully.) 

On  ***nirodhassacca***  and  ***maggasacca***  ***dhammas***  the  function  of  practice  must  be performed through inference after hearing indirectly from Noble Ones, the Exalted One etc., in a way that “***nirodha*** ***sacca*** is worth desiring, pleasing with, cherishing; ***magga*** ***sacca*** is worth desiring, pleasing with, cherishing”. 

Among  those  four  Noble  Truths,  ***dukkha***  ***sacca***  and  ***samudaya***  ***sacca***  are  very profound, due to occurrence of difficulty to be seen; ***nirodha*** ***sacca*** and ***maggasacca*** are, in turn, very difficult to be seen, due to occurrence of profoundity. 

The Noble Truth of ***dukkha*** is obvious through nature of arising. When one stumbles on short stump, when one is pierced with a thorn etc., it usually reaches a situation which is deserving to say as “Ah….. ***dukkha***.” The Noble Truth of Origin of ***dukkha***, ***samudaya*** ***sacca*** is also obvious when one wants to eat, drink, wear etc. In order to know and see penetratively on specific characters of those ***dukkha*** ***sacca*** and ***samudaya*** ***sacca*** ***dhammas***, it is however, very profound.  

The virtuous ***meditator*** should like to consider in this case, please. It is very difficult to see corporeal units which are smaller than sub-particles called ***paramāṇumyū*** by insight knowledge. Those corporeal units have  got lifespan of very short instant about one *pico* second (10-12). The phenomena of arising and perishing away of corporeal units are so swift that it is very difficult to know and see each specific character of (8) kinds, or (9) kinds or  (10) kinds of ultimate corporeal nature within respective corporeal units penetratively. 

Mental ***dhammas*** have also got very short lifespan about one *femto* second (10-15). The phenomenon of arising and perishing away of one mind moment is so swift that it is very difficult to discriminate as “this is five-doors-adverting; this is seeing-consciousness” etc. It is, over and above, very difficult to differentiate each specific characters of mental ***dhammas***, ***phassa***,  ***vedanā***, ***saññā***,  ***cetanā***  etc.,  which  are  arising  simultaneously  within  same  mind moment by insight knowledge. 

Furthermore, unless the Perfectly Self-Enlightened Buddha appears in the world, it is impossible to know principle of dependent-origination for disciples. Those are ***dhammas*** which can be known and seen by only virtuous persons who follows and fulfil noble three trainings called morality, concentration, wisdom instructed by the Exalted One systematically in order to make good headway. Those are the ***dhammas*** which are very difficult to be seen by insight. It is, over and above, very difficult to differentiate each specific characters of twelve  factors  of  dependent-origination  by  insight-knowledge.  Due  to  occurrence  of difficulty  to  be  seen,  these  two  Noble  Truths,  ***dukkha  sacca***  and  ***samudaya  sacca***,  are, therefore, very profound. 

**PAGE-549** 

Endeavouring for the sake of ability to see two kinds of Noble Truths called ***nirodha sacca***, ***magga sacca*** by insight knowledge is similar to not only extending one’s hand in order to handle the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception which is out and out the apex existence in (31) realms but also extending one’s leg in order to touch the hell called ***avīci*** which is present in the deepest among eight levels. It is similar to a such endeavouring so as to touch tips of two tailed-hair of the yak, which are split into the one-hundredth in diameter.  Due  to  lack  of  dirtiness  with  defilements  which  are  capable  of  worrying  and torturing, the two kinds of Noble Truths are, actually, reaching into Eternal Peace. It has the nature of inability to produce the next coming-into-existence again. Due to un-experience anymore  and  due  to  unobvious  one  through  the  nature  of  existing,  it  is  very  profound. Because those two kinds of Noble Truths can be known and seen by very profound insight knowledge, natural ordinary knowledge can never know and see those two kinds of Noble Truths. Due to occurrence of extreme profoundity, ***nirodha sacca*** and ***magga*** ***sacca*** are very difficult to be seen. 

Thus, due to occurrence of difficulty to be seen and due to occurrence of profoundity, with referring to arising of knowledge of various practices before the Noble Path is attained by means of learning from teachers, the Exalted One preached on the Right View by dividing four kinds, i.e., the Insight-Knowledge which realizes ***dukkha sacca***; the Insight-Knowledge which realizes ***samudaya*** ***sacca***; the Insight-Knowledge which realizes ***nirodha sacca***; the Insight-Knowledge which realizes ***magga*** ***sacca***. Because there are four varieties in the Right View Knowledge in mundane practice of mindfulness foundation (***saṭipaṭṭhāna,*** those are preached by dividing as four kinds. 

However, at the Noble Path (-moment) called ***paṭivedha*** (=penetrative realizing), it is only one kind of Right View Knowledge. The Noble Path arises only once as natural fixed law. Only one Path-Knowledge called Right View is available within one mind moment of the Noble Path. Remaining mental concomitants, ***phassa***, ***vedanā*** etc., are also available as one kind each only. 

Through taking object of ***nirodha sacca*** called unconditioned element, Eternal Peace, ***nibbāna***, the single Noble Path-Knowledge called that Supra mundane Right View eradicates absolutely the delusion (***moha***) which conceals four Noble Truths so as not to see because of presence  of  benefiting  factor  of  efficiency  of  relation  of  object  by  that  ***nirodhasacca***, ***nibbāna***.  At  that  time  the  nescience  called  ignorance  (***avijjā***)  disappears  but  the Enlightenment called ***vijjañāṇa*** arises. Thus at the Noble Path (-moment) a single Right View realizes  penetratively  on  ***dukkha  sacca***,  ***samudaya  sacca***,  ***magga  sacca***  through accomplishing  the  function  (***kiccasiddhi***),  while  on  ***nirodha***  ***sacca***  through  taking  object directly. 

\2.  ***sammāsankappa*** (Right Thought) 

These three kinds of thought, i.e., 

1. ***nekkhammasankappa*** = renunciation thought which is free from sensual objects, 
1. ***avyāpādasankappa*** = thought which is free from ill-will 
1. ***a-vihimsāsankappa*** = thought which is free from torturing, 

are called the Right Thought. (***M-1-88***) 

**PAGE-550** 

1. The right thought called ***nekkhammasankappa*** associates with perception of avoiding from thinking about “sensuous objects (***kāmasankappa***)” 
1. The right thought called ***avyāpāda sankappa*** associates with perception of avoiding from thinking about “how to destroy beings, ***saṅkhara*** (= ***vyāpāda sankappa***)” 
1. The right thought called ***avihimsā sankappa*** associates with perception of avoiding from thinking about “how to torture beings (= ***vihimsā sankappa***).” 

Due to occurrence of difference of perceptions of refraining from ***kāma sankappa, vyāpāda sankappa, vihimsās ankappa***, these three kinds of Right Thought have variations in practices of mindfulness foundation previous to the Noble Path (***pubbabhāga*** ***saṭipaṭṭhāna*** ***magga***).  At the Noble Path (-moment) a single ***kusala sankappa*** (=wholesome thought) which associates with the Path-Knowledge arises after fulfilling (8) factors of Noble Path by means of accomplishing so as not to arise ***akusala*** ***sankappa*** (unwholesome thought) which arises in three sources called ***kāma*** ***sankappa***, ***vyāpāda sankappa***, ***vihimsā sankappa*** after severing route of unwholesome thought. This ***kusala sankappa*** is called ***sammāsankappa*** (= Right Thought). (***Dī***-***A-2-392***) 

The right thought called ***avyāpādasankappa*** is a kind of thought which associates with loving kindness (***mettā***) while ***avihimsā sankappa*** is a kind of thought which associates with compassion (***karuṇā***). The right thought called ***nekkhamma*** ***sankappa*** has, actually, numerous dealing with great ranges. Initial application (***vitakka***) which associates with the First Absorption and initial application which associates wit ***vipassanā*** knowledge are also inclusive  in  this  ***nekkhamma***  ***sankappa***.  (Please  see  section  of  ***nekkhammasita***  ***vedanā*** mentioned previously in this volume.) 

Due  to  presence  of  explanation  that  “***svāyam  ārammaṇe  cittassa  abhiniropana lakkhaṇo*** = it has the characteristic of initial application of the mind towards object” (***Vs-1- 138***), functions of that ***sankappa*** ***vitakka*** can vary depending on discerned objects, in the aspect of the practice of mindfulness foundation previous to the Noble Path. The essence is as follows.\_\_\_\_ 

***Pāli Quotation (Vs-2-146)*** 

1. The nature of initial application of the  mind towards various objects called five kinds of  clinging  aggregates  which  are  called ***dukkha*** ***sacca***  is  the  Right  Thought.  The penetrative knowing on those ***dukkha sacca*** ***dhammas*** up to the specific character is the Right View. 
1. The nature of initial application of the mind towards various objects called ***samudaya sacca*** ***dhammas*** is the Right Thought. The nature of initial application of the mind towards various objects called causal relationship between ***samudaya sacca*** ***dhammas*** and ***dukkha sacca*** ***dhammas*** is the Right Thought. Penetrative  knowing on those ***samudaya sacca*** ***dhammas*** up to specific character and causal relationship between two Noble Truths ***dhammas*** is the Right View. 
1. The  nature  of  initial  application  of  the  mind  towards  various  objects  called phenomena of ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***, ***asubha*** of ***dukkha sacca*** and ***samudaya sacca*** ***dhammas*** is the right thought. Penetrative knowing and seeing on those phenomena of ***anicca***,***dukkha***, ***anatta***, ***asubha*** of ***dukkha sacca*** and ***samudaya*** ***sacca*** ***dhammas*** is the Right View. (Mental ***dhammas*** of absorption (***jhāna***) are also inclusive in the list of this ***dukkha sacca*** ***dhammas***.)
