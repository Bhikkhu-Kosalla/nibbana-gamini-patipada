Cakkhana went to stretch of paddy field so as to search for rabbit. At that time a young  rabbit also reached into paddy field in  order to  eat tender paddy.  When Cakkana followed that rabbit rapidly as soon as he saw young rabbit was caught by winding around with a creeper. That rabbit was crying, due to afraid of danger of death. Because of hearing that  crying,  Cakkana  went  to  rabbit  and  caught  easily.  He  thought  that  it  was  ready  for making suitable diet of his mother. Then he bore in mind that “if I cut out other’s life because of vitality of my mother, this killing misdeed is not suitable for me”. ( He remembered fault of misdeed of killing being.) After bearing in mind in that way, he said rabbit that … “Go away and take pasturage in the forest in company with group of rabbits,” and released it. When he reached at home his elder brother asked him whether he has got rabbit or not, and he replied about all happened. At that time his brother scolded him for releasing rabbit. At that time Cakkana devotee approached to his mother and said true words that  

“***yato  aham  jāto,  nābhijānāmi  sañcicca  pāņam  jīvita  voropetā***”  ***ti  saccam  vatva aṭṭhāsi***.*** 

“I never kill other being intentionally since maturity”, 

and stood besides his mother. 

During saying true words Cakkana’s mother was clear of disease. (***Abhi-A-1-146***). In this story the manner of abstaining from killing rabbit which was encountered to commit directly  is  ***sampattivirati***  (meeting  by  chance  abstinence).  It  is  obvious  that  this ***sampattavirati*** takes present object which is deserving to commit recently. 

\1.  ***samādānavirati*** \_\_\_ 

***Pāli*** ***Quotation*** (***Abhi-A-1-146***) 

The  nature  of  abstinence,  which  arises by  means  of  observing precepts,  is  called ***samādānavirati***. The nature of abstinence which arises in continuums of those persons who do not commit even though they give their lives up for the period during or after observing precepts, due to observing precepts with strong determination is called ***samādānavirati***. It should be recognized in this way. (***Abhi***-***A-1-146***) 

**A devotee who dwelled at *Uttara vaṭdamāna* mountain \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ PAGE-202** 

That devotee observed precepts in front of Venerable ***Pingalabuddharakkhita Mahā Thero*** who stayed in the monastery called ***Ambariya*** and then harrowed. After he harrowed he set free his bulls and those bulls lost. While he was searching and wandering lost bulls he climbed on the ***Uttara vaṭdamāna*** Mountain. A boa constrictor wound around that devotee on the mountain. At that time that devotee thought to sever that snake’s head with very sharp adze. Then he bore in mind that “even though I have observed precepts in front of very respectable teacher, if I break down precept, it will be not suitable for me. After bearing in mind three times in this way \_\_\_\_ 

“***jīvitam pariccajāmi, na sikkhāpadam***,” = “life will be given up but not precept.” 

Then he thrown very sharp adze away into the forest. As soon as that moment boa constrictor released him and crawled away due to power of morality. 

(***Abhi***-***A-146, 147***) 

According to this story this ***samādāna*** ***virati*** also takes present object. In this kind of ***virati*** has got previous observance of precepts but in ***sampattavirati*** there is no observance of precepts previously. The nature of abstinence between two kinds are the same each other but only difference in presence of previous observance of precepts. 

***Pāli*** ***Quotation*** (***M-ṭī-1-305***) 

**3. *samuccheda virati*** ***Pāli*** ***Quotation*** (***Abhi-A-1-147***) 

“The nature of abstinence, which is associating with the Noble Path, which arises by means  of  absolute  eradication  of  underlying  tendency  element  (***anusayadhātu***)  of  every misdeed and wrong livelihood, is called ***samucchedavirati***”, it should be recognized in this way. In the continuum of Noble Ones any way of consideration that “other being’s life would be killed” never arise since the arising of that ***samuccheda*** ***virati***. (***Abhi***-***A***-1-147) 

**9.G. It is only wholesome deed** 

***pañca sikkhāpadāni…. Pa….kusalāyeva. (Abhi-2-305)*** 

Due  to  presence  of  preaching  by  the  Exalted  One  that…  “abstinence  ***dhammas*** (=precepts)  are  wholesome  deeds  certainly”,  abstinence  ***dhammas***  always  associate  with impulsions only but not registering. 

**PAGE-203** 

**9.H. Object of abstinence *dhammas*** 

***Pāli*** ***Quotation*** ***(Abhi-2-305) (Abhi-A-2-369)*** 

***(Abhi-A-2-369) (Mūlaṭī-2-190)*** 

In  accordance  with  preaching  of  above  ***Pāli***  Text,  commentary,  subcommentary, mundane abstinence ***dhammas*** take present sensual object only. 

In ***Sikkhāpada Vibhanga*** the Exalted One preached that precepts have got object of being only. 

Because  those  precepts  take  object  of  corporeality-mentality,  conditioned  things which reach to designation as being in the aspect of conventional truth, all these precepts are instructed by means of ***sampattavirati***. The Exalted One, therefore preached those ***dhammas*** are the ***dhammas*** with both object of sensual ***dhamma*** and present ***dhamma***. 

Furthermore  it  is  abstained  from  such  base;  due  to  occurrence  of  real  external ***dhamma*** of that base which is abstained, it should be recognized all precepts have got objects of external corporeality-mentality, conditioned things. (***Abhi***-***A-2-369***) 

In above explanations of commentary it is found that the Exalted One instructed all precepts  by  means  of  ***sampatta***  ***virati***.  According  to  that  word,  ‘***sampattivirati***’,  due  to presence of misunderstanding on the word ***sampattavirati*** which is included in three kinds of ***virati***, i.e., ***sampatta*** ***virati***, ***samādāna*** ***virati***, ***samuccheda*** ***virati***, \_\_\_\_ sub commentator, ***Mūļatīkā Sayadaw*** explained as “***sampatte paccuppanne ārammaņe***” etc. 

Because only when present object which is deserving to commit reaches, in other words,  only  when  the  object  which  is  deserving  to  commit  reaches  into  present  period, various  misdeeds,  killing  being  etc.,  which  reaches  toward  can  be  abstained,  sub- commentator explained the word, ***sampatta***, as “***sampatte paccuppanme ārammaņe***”. It is right.\_\_\_\_\_ The abstinence called ***samādāna*** ***virati*** also does not arise during still observing but only when present object which is deserving to commit is encountered either during observing precepts or after observed later. The abstinence called ***samuccheda*** ***virati***, actually, does  not  concern  with  this  aspect  of  ***vipassanā***  practice,  due  to  occurrence  of  pure Supramundane ***dhamma***. 

**PAGE -204** 

Because during discerning on abstinence mental ***dhammas*** it is not the period when present object which is deserving to commit is not facing with practicing ***meditator***, it is, therefore presented in above so as to discern abstinence mental ***dhammas*** by taking object of any kind of misdeeds or wrong livelihood which has been abstained for once upon any time. 

**9.I. Opinion of objects of *paņātipāta* (killing being)etc., *Pāli*** ***Quotation*** (***Abhi***-***A-2-366***) 

1. Volition of killing being has got the object of other’s controlling faculty of life. 
1. Volition of stealing has got object of either being or non-living conditioned things. 
1. Volition of sexual misconduct has got objects of woman and man. 
1. Volition of lying has got object of either being or non-living conditioned things. 
1. Volition  of  using  intoxicating  drinks  and  narcotic  has  got  object  of  non-living conditioned things. (***Abhi***-***A-2-366***) 

**9.J. The term, “*sikkhāpada* (=precept),” means *Pāli*** ***Quotation*** (***Abhi***-***A-2-365***) 

According to explanation of above commentary\_\_\_\_\_ 

1. The abstinence mental concomitant is also called precept (***sikkhāpada***); 
1. The volition is also called precept; 
1. Not only both kinds of abstinence and volition but associating mental ***dhammas*** of volition  are  also  precepts,  due  to  occurrence  of  group  of  ***dhammas***  which  are deserving to observe and practice. 

**9.K. Analyzing on object of abstinence *Pāli*** ***Quotation*** (***Abhi***-***A-2-368***) 

**PAGE-205**  

***(Mūlaṭī-2-189) (Anuṭī-A-190)*** 

As determination on object of misdeeds,  killing being etc., should be understood, determination  on  objects  of  precepts,  abstaining  from  killing  being  etc.,  should  also  be understood. 

1. The precept, which is factor of abstaining from killing being, refrains from enmity volition (***veracetanā***) of oneself by taking object of other’s controlling faculty of life which is deserving to commit. 
1. The precept, which is factor of abstaining from stealing other’s property which is not given through bodily and verbal actions, refrains from enmity volition of oneself by taking object of either being or non-living conditioned things which are deserving to commit. 
3. The  precept,  which  is  factor  of  abstaining  from  sexual  misconduct,  refrains  from enmity volition of oneself by taking object of either woman or man who is deserving to commit. 
3. The precept, which is factor of abstaining from lying, refrains from enmity volition of oneself by taking object of either being or non-living conditioned things which are deserving to commit. 
3. The precept, which is factor of abstaining from using intoxicating drinks and narcotic, refrains from enmity volition of oneself by taking object of non-living conditioned things called intoxicating drinks and narcotic which are deserving to commit. 

It is right.\_\_\_\_\_ All these abstinence volition refrain from enmity volition only by taking object of bases, other’s controlling faculty of life etc., called ***vītikkamitabbavatthu***, which are deserving to commit. (***Abhi***-***A-2-368***) 

In above explanations of commentary some precepts are explained as presence of object  of  being,  presence  of  object  called  woman  or  man.  Sub-commentators,  ***Mūlaṭīkā Sayakdaw***  and  ***Anuṭīkā***  ***Sayadaw***  explained  the  fact  relating  to  these  explanations  as follows.\_\_\_\_\_ 

**PAGE-206** 

It should be recognized enmity volitions only are refrained by taking object of base which is deserving to commit (***vītikkamitabba vatthu***), which is called living conditioned things and non-living conditioned things which are obsessed through state of affair of being, state of affair of gold, silver in such way that “let being will be stolen; let gold, silver will be stolen; let woman or man will be committed sexually” etc. It means these abstinence volitions never arise by taking object of mass of concept called being, mass of concept called gold- silver etc. It is right. \_\_\_\_\_ 

***“pañca sikkhāpadā parittārammaņā.” (Abhi-2-305)*** 

- “Five  kinds  of  precepts  have  got  object  of  ***paritta***  ***dhamma***  called  sensuous 

corporeality-mentality,” preached by the Exalted One. 

All these abstinence volition refrain from enmity volition only by taking object of bases,  other’s  controlling  faculty  of  life  etc.,  called  ***vītikkamitabbavatthu***,  which  are deserving to commit. 

It will be explained in the commentary (***Abhi***-***A-2-368***) in this way. (***Mūlaṭī***-***2-189***) (***Anuṭī***-***2-190***) 

The meaning is as follows: \_\_\_\_\_\_ 

In this case with regarding to the word saying that “being is taken object”, there is no being, in the aspect of  ultimate sense but corporeality-mentality, conditioned things only which are obsessed as being. Similarly with regarding to those words saying that “woman is taken as object,” “man is taken as object,” there is no real woman or no real man, in the aspect  of  ultimate  sense  but  corporeality-mentality,  conditioned  things  only  which  are obsessed as woman or man. Similarly\_\_\_ with regarding to the word saying that “gold-silver are taken as object if those are scrutinized by eye of wisdom or eye of ultimate sense, there is no gold-silver but mass of conditioned things which are obsessed as gold-silver. Therefore it should  be  recognized  there  is  only  object  of  ***sañkhārārammaņa***  (=  object  of  living conditioned things, object of non-living conditioned things) although it is said there is object of ***sattārammaņatā*** (= object of being). The term, ***vītikkamitabba vatthu***, also means only sensuous corporeality-mentality which are designated as the bases which are deserving to commit. 

Therefore abstinence ***dhammas*** refrains from misdeeds which are deserving to abstain through taking object of any kind of present sensuous corporeality-mentality, conditioned things which are bases of deserving to abstain (***vītikkamitabba*** ***vatthu***). During abstaining in that  way,  although  precept  is  observed  previously  before  encountering  with  base  which deserving to commit it is only ***samādāna*** volitional morality but not ***samādāna*** abstinence. Only when one abstains not to commit, even though present base, which is deserving to commit, is encountered directly, it can become ***samādāna*** abstinence. Furthermore, while the base  which  is  deserving  to  commit  is  encountering,  if  the  precept  is  observed  without committing  it,  it  is  also ***samādāna***  abstinence.  It  should be  recognized  during  observing precept in recent days without obvious occurrence of object which is deserving to commit this way of observance is only volitional morality but not abstinence morality.

**9.L  Two kinds of boundless mental concomitants (*appamaññā* *cetasika*)** Way of discerning on compassion mental concomitant (***karuņā***) 

***Karuņā*** = the nature of having or feeling pity or compassion by taking object of suffering being, the nature of desiring to save from suffering circumstance, 

This  mental  concomitant  compassion  (***karuņā***)  usually  associates  with  either absorption of compassion or sensuous great whole some consciousness. Way of discerning on mental  ***dhammas***  of  absorption  concentration,  including  compassion  can  be  seen  and performed as shown in tables, page (107), this volume. Way of practice for attainment of absorption of compassion will be presented in Section of ***Samatha*** Practice, Volume V. In this section way of discerning on mental ***dhammas*** together with compassion, which are associating with great wholesome consciousness will be presented. 

1. Develop concentration step by step. 
1. Keep life-continuum mind-clear-element in mind. 
1. Take object of any suffering being to whom the righteous ***meditator*** usually feels compassion. 
1. When  that  object  of  concept  of  being  impinges  into  life-continuum  mind-clear- element,  continuity  of  impulsions,  including  compassion  of  mind-door-cognitive processes must be kept in mind continuously.

If  previous  faith-wisdom  group  mental  ***dhammas***  are  added  with  a  mental concomitant called compassion (***karuņā***), it will become (35/34/34/33) respectively. Discern (4) ways through changing knowledge, pleasurable interest. In this case, the faith is the nature of strong belief on action and consequence of action and the wisdom is the nature of well understanding  on  action  and  consequence  of  action.  Because  compassion  ***dhamma***  takes object of pure concept of suffering being, registering can not fall after impulsions. 

**PAGE-208** 

**9.M  Way of discerning on appreciative joy (*muditā*)** 

***muditā*** = the nature of having or feeling appreciative joy (***muditā***) by taking object of happy being with full of wealth 

This  mental  concomitant,  appreciative  joy,  usually  associates  with  either  absorption  of compassion  or  sensuous  great  whole  some  consciousness.  Way  of  discerning  on  mental ***dhammas*** of absorption concentration, including appreciative joy, can be seen and performed as shown in tables, page (108), this volume. Way of practice for attainment of absorption of compassion will be presented in Section of ***Samatha*** Practice, Volume V. In this section way of discerning  on  mental ***dhammas*** together with compassion, which are associating  with great wholesome consciousness will be presented.

Discern (4) ways through changing knowledge, pleasurable interest. In this case, the faith is the nature of strong belief on action and consequence of action and the wisdom is the nature of  well  understanding  on  action  and  consequence  of  action.  Because  appreciative  joy (***muditā***) ***dhamma*** takes object of pure concept of happy being, registering can not fall after impulsions. 

Facts to be careful \_\_\_\_\_\_ 

These mental concomitants, compassion and appreciative joy can associate with mere functioning  consciousness  (***kiriyācitta***).  However  those  kinds  of  mere  functioning consciousness can arise in the continuum of Arahants only, resulting in omitting in this way of discerning. 

PAGE-209 

Furthermore noble teachers were disputing on the fact relating to whether neutrality feeling associates with these compassion and appreciative joy or not. Venerable ***Anuruddha*** ***Maha  Thero***  preferred  the  opinion  of  association  with  neutrality  feeling.  Although  it  is difficult to arise neutrality feeling before practice of compassion and appreciative joy are powerful, when the practice becomes sharp and powerful neutrality feeling can associate with those mental concomitants”, suggested by Venerable ***Anuruddha Mahā Thero***. It should be recognized it is similar to the circumstance in which although ***vipassanā*** practice performed by the consciousness which associated with knowledge, when ***vipassanā*** practice become sharp and powerful it can accomplish without knowledge sometimes. 

According  to  this  opinion,  for  a  righteous  ***meditator***  who  is  unable  to  develop absorption  of  compassion  and  absorption  of  appreciative  joy  up  to  the  third  absorption concentration,  that  person’s  practice  of  compassion,  appreciative  joy  will  associate  with agreeable  feeling  frequently.  Therefore  it  should  be  recognized  (35)  kinds  of  mental ***dhammas*** and (34) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** will be frequent, if knowledge associates or not respectively at that time. It can be considered that in the continuums of only those persons who  always  practice  compassion  and  appreciative  joy,  these  mental  concomitants  will associate with neutrality feeling frequently. It will be possible the fact in the continuums of those  persons  who  never  practice  compassion  and  appreciative  joy,  if  those  mental concomitants arise, knowledge will not associate frequently. 

**9.N.  Abstinence boundless (*virati appamaññā*) and function of registering** 

***kāmāvacara vipākānampi ekantaparittārammaņattā, appamaññānam ca sattārammaņattā, viratīnam ekanta kasalattā vuttam “appamaññāvirati vajjitā” ti. (Famous ṭīkā)*** 

- “Due to certain presence of object of sensuous corporeality-mentality which are called ***paritta*** of sensuous consequence ***dhammas***; due to presence of object of concept of being of boundless mental concomitants called compassion, appreciative joy; due to certain presence of nature of wholesome deed of three kinds of abstinence mental concomitants; boundless and  abstinence  mental  concomitants  are  unable  to  associate  with  great  consequence consciousness,” opinion of above famous ***ṭīkā***. 

Sensuous consequences take object of sensuous ***dhammas*** called ***paritta*** certainly. Registering  consequences  are  also  sensuous  consequences.  Those  boundless  mental concomitants  called  compassion,  appreciative  joy,  take  object  of  concept  of  being.  Thus sensuous consequence and boundless have got different objects. Then mundane abstinences have the nature of wholesome deed certainly, resulting in variation nature compared with consequence.  Therefore  tow  boundless  mental  concomitants  and  three  abstinence  mental concomitants are not deserving to associate with registering consequence which are sensuous consequence with root causes. 

Because three kinds of abstinence have object of sensuous ***dhammas*** called bases, which are deserving to commit (= ***vītikkamitabba vatthu***), which are deserving to refrain (=***viramitabba vatthu***), registering can  fall sometimes, if object is very obvious (***vibhūtā*** ***rammaņa***) for sensuous impulsion, sensuous being, sensuous object. Therefore in way of discerning  on  abstinence  mental  concomitants,  available  registering  is  also  shown  after impulsions. 

**PAGE-210** 

It should be recognized, however, abstinence can associate with impulsions only but not registering consequence, as mentioned above. Therefore although (35) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** are shown in impulsions, (34)  kinds only  are shown in registering. Boundless ***dhammas*** take object of concept of being only, resulting in inability to fall registering which can take object of sensuous ***dhammas*** only after those impulsions. 

**9.O  A fact to be considered for wise virtuous person \_\_\_\_\_** 

In  ***Pāli***  Text  of  ***Appamaññā  Vibhanga***,  ***Abhidhamma***,  the  Exalted  One  preached  on compassion practice as follows. \_\_\_\_ 

***Pāli*** ***Quotation*** (***Abhi***-***2-286***) 

- How does the practicing *bhikkhu* stay and spread with the mind associating with 

compassion towards a direction ? Worldly simile is that \_\_\_\_ as compassion arises through seeing a person who is very poor and inferior lineage with great suffering, who has got dark life of misdeeds only \_\_\_\_ similarly one is staying by spreading with compassion on to all beings. (***Abhi***-***A-2-286***) 

Then it is preached in section of appreciative joy as follows:\_\_\_\_ 

***Pāli*** ***Quotation*** (***Abhi***-***A-2-287***) 

- How does the practicing *bhikkhu* stay and spread with the mind associating with 

appreciative joy towards a direction? Worldly similarly is that \_\_\_\_\_ as joyful feeling arises through seeing lovely person who can proliferate heart and soul \_\_\_\_\_\_ similarly one is staying by spreading with appreciative joy on to all beings. (***Abhi***-***2-287***) 

These ways of developing compassion and appreciative joy are accomplished through preaching  methodology  of  ***Suttanta  bhājanīya***  (=  peripharisis  method).  Only  when  one develops those practices through taking objects of concepts of shape and form of beings, can he attain absorption of compassion and absorption of appreciative joy. If one develops those practices  through  taking  object  of  ultimate  nature  of  corporeality-mentality  which  are designated  as  being,  compassion  practice  and  appreciative  joy  practice  can  not  be accomplished, resulting in inability to attain those absorption ***dhammas***. The Exalted One, therefore, preached on those practices through preaching methodology of ***Suttanta bhājanīya*** only. 

**PAGE-211** 

Then the fact to be considered that whether or not abstinence mental concomitants also take object of concept of being as compassion and appreciative joy mental concomitant do. 

In  the  commentary  called  ***Sammohavinodanī***  (***Abhi-A-2-369***),  it  is  explained that…… 

***ārammaņattikesu pana yāni sikkhāpadāni ettha sattārammaņānīti*** 

***vuttāni, (Abhi-a-2-369)*** 

- some precepts have got object of being only. However that commentary continued 

to  explain  that  even  though  those precepts  take  object  of being,  only  conditioned  things ***dhammas*** which are designated as being are taken as object. (It has already been mentioned in above section.). 

There is a reasonable question whether or not being who is mass of conditioned things is also taken as object as corporeality-mentality, conditioned things, which are designated as being, are taken as object. 

In this world there are foolish worldly persons, who never experience to hear and learn ultimate nature of corporeality-mentality, who can not reach up to the field of ultimate nature,  though  they  have  experience  to  hear  and  learn,  who  lack  eye  of  wisdom.  Those foolish worldly persons are unable to take object of the ultimate nature called conditioned things of bases which are deserving to commit when those bases are encountered. During encountering with base which is deserving to commit, if those foolish worldly persons abstain from that base which is deserving to commit by taking object of concept, woman, man etc., can ***sampattavirati*** not arise as above example of Cakkana devotee? 

It  needs  thinking  about  very  carefully  for  wise  and  virtuous  persons.  The  next reasonable fact is that did Cakkana devotee take object of either vitality of young rabbit through guessing or ultimate nature of controlling faculty of vitality of young rabbit, due to ability to reach up to the field of ultimate nature by insight? 

If one accepts the opinion that in the continuum of only virtuous persons who can take object of the ultimate nature of conditioned things, in other words, in the continuum of only virtuous persons who have got ***vipassanā*** knowledge, knowledge of Analyzing Mentality- Corporeality etc., during encountering with base which is deserving to commit, only when those person refrain from that base the abstinence (***virati***) arises, it will be very far to attain wholesome deed of abstinence for foolish worldly persons without eye of wisdom. 

If  a  righteous  person  can  accept  the  opinion  that  in  accordance  with  above explanation, “***sattārammaņani (Abhi-A-2-369)***, abstinence mental concomitants or precepts take objects of  

1. both being which is mass of corporeality-mentality, conditioned things 
1. and  mass  of  ***dhammas***  of  corporeality-mentality,  conditioned  things  which  are designated as being, 

the fact that wholesome deeds of abstinence ***dhammas*** can arise in the continuum of worldly persons without eye of wisdom too”, will be accepted. 

**PAGE-212** 

If one accept the opinion that “precepts or abstinence mental concomitants can take object  of  being  who  is  mass  of  corporeality-mentality,  conditioned  things,”  it  should  be recognized  registering  can  not  fall  after  impulsions  which  are  associated  with  those abstinence mental concomitants. 

One  should  not  misunderstand  that  this  opinion  opposes  to  commentary  and  sub- commentary. It is only discussion on the fact whether or not abstinence wholesome deeds are available in the continuum of worldly persons who have no experience to hear and learn the ultimate ***dhamma***. However if it is considered that “those abstinence ***dhammas*** can take object of bulk of ultimate ***dhamma***, which have not broken down compactness yet, which are worth designating as being,” there will be no contradict. 

General Notes \_\_\_\_\_ 

Now  ways  of  discerning  on  wholesome  group  mental  ***dhammas***,  including wholesome impulsions which arise by taking (6) kinds of objects, called visible-object line, audible-object line, olfactory-object line, sapid-object line, tactile-object line, ***dhamma***-object line have been presented. 

In these examples of cognitive processes, registering are also shown as generally. 

Only  when  object  is ***atimahantā-rammaņa***  which  are  numerous  consciousness  of cognitive processes for five-doors and only when object is ***vibhutārammaņa*** (obvious object) for mind-door, registering is available. If those cognitive processes are ***voṭṭhabbana vāra, javanavāra*** in five-doors and unobvious object (***avibhūtārammaņa***) fall in the mind-door, registering is unavailable, due to cessation of cognitive process at determining (***vuṭṭho***) or impulsion  (***javana***)  only.  Because  the  practising  ***meditator***  can  understand  whether registerings fall or not gradually, those cognitive processes without registerings are omitted. Due to omitting in that way, one should not misunderstand that those cognitive processes without registerings must not be discerned. Both kinds of cognitive processes with or without registerings must be kept in mind thoroughly. During discerning in that way, the righteous ***meditator*** has to endeavour in order to understand how numerous cognitive processes arise by separating of life-continuums between them.

**10. Section of way of discerning on unwholesome group unwholesome impulsions of cognitive processes** 

It will be presented on way of discerning mental ***dhammas*** of mind-door-cognitive process which includes unwholesome impulsions, which has less number of consciousness, as beginning, similar to way of discerning on wholesome group mental ***dhammas***.  

According to explanation found in the commentary that \_\_\_\_ 

***Pāli*** ***Quotation*** (***Abhi***-***A-1-271***) 

It will be presented on way of discerning on unwholesome mental ***dhammas*** which arise by taking object of corporeal ***dhammas*** beforehand. During showing in that way those unwholesome impulsions of mind-door-cognitive process which arise by taking object of transparent  corporeality  (***pasādarūpa***),  subtle  corporeality  (***sukhumarūpa***)  which  are designated as ***dhamma***-object will be presented previously.  

In the commentary called ***Āyatanapabba vaņņanā, Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta, Mūla paņņāsa*** it is explained how (10) kinds of fetters (***samyojana***) arise by taking visible-object. It will be presented on way of discerning on unwholesome ***dhammas*** called fetters which arise by taking object of both corporeal ***dhammas*** which are inclusive in ***dhamma***-object and remaining various corporeal ***dhammas*** through following on those explanations as example. Now it will be presented on explanatory notes from commentary.

**10.A  How fetters (*samyojana*) arise by taking visible-object *Pāli*** ***Quotation*** (***M-A-1-292***) 

Those  words,  “***yañca  tadubhayam  paṭicca  uppajjati  saññojanam***”,  means  \_\_\_\_ through basing on both kinds of that eye-transparent-element and that visible-object, (10) kinds of fetters ***dhammas***, namely, 

1. sensuous desire fetter (***kāmarāga***) 
1. hatred fetter (***paṭigha***) 
1. conceit fetter (***māna***) 
1. wrong view fetter ( ***diṭṭhi***) 
1. skeptics fetter (***vicikicchā***) 
1. desire to existence fetter (***bhavarāga***) 
7. rule and rite fetter (***sīlabbataparāmāsa***) 
7. envy fetter (***issā***) 
7. stinginess fetter (***macchariya***) 
7. ignorance fetter (***avijjā***), 

arise consequently; that fetter is also distinguished by means of each specific character as it really  is.  In  the  next  method  \_\_\_\_  it  is  distinguished  through  function  (***kicca  rasa***)  and specific character. How do these (10) kinds of fetters arise? 

1. In the continuum of person who has heartfelt desire on visible-object which reaches into appearance, impingement, which is very desirable object, by means of pleasing with sensuality, the sensuous desire fetter arises. (It means strong attachment which is capable of desiring with defilement sensuality (***kilesākāma***), which is called craving on  sensuous  base  (***kāmavatthu***)  which  is  visible-object.  It  rejects  two  kinds  of attachment, i.e., attachment on existence, attachment on wrong view. This sensuous desire  fetter  is  the  nature  of  heartfelt  attachment  on  desirable  visible-object  by discerning as comely object.) 

[Notes: \_\_\_\_ These fetters are shown as group-wise system, greed-group, hatred-group etc., so as to discern easily.] 

2. In  the  continuum  of  person  who  has  heartfelt  desire  on  complete  existence (***sampattibhava***) in a way that “because this desirable visible-object is available easily for  us  in  this  complete  existence  with  various  objects,  visible-object  etc.,  may complete existence with various-objects, visible-object etc., be become in future too,” the desire to existence fetter arises consequently. 
2. In the continuum of person who practices rule and rite called cow’s practice dog’s practice through thinking in a way that “if rule and rite practices are well performed, it will be possible to attain visible-object with this nature in future, the rule and rite fetter arises consequently. 

**PAGE-215** 

4. In the continuum of person who obsesses that “this visible-object is permanent (***nicca***) and durable (***dhuva***),” the wrong view fetter arises consequently. 

***Pāli*** ***Quotation*** (***M-ṭī-1-379***) 

[Notes:  \_\_\_\_  Obsession  on  visible-object  as  permanent,  durable  etc.,  is  wrong  view  of eternity (***sassata*** ***diṭṭhi***). Showing that eternity wrong view in commentary is accomplished through preaching methodology of ***nidassana naya*** (apparent one is shown). It is also worth desiring to count various wrong views, annihilation wrong view etc., which obsesses on the visible-object as “this visible-object will be ceased and annihilated.” 

In this case these three kinds of fetters, i.e., sensuous desire, desire to existence, rule and rite fetter are generally group of mental ***dhammas*** which belong to greed-wrong view group. Sensuous desire fetter and desire to existence fetter can associate with wrong view generally. Sometimes they can associate with conceit (***māna***) or sometimes those do not associate  with  both  kinds  of  wrong  view  and  conceit.  Rule  and  rite  fetter,  actually,  can associate with wrong-view only. 

***Diṭṭhi*** (wrong-view) and ***moha*** (delusion) 

If that visible-object is obsessed as (1)***nicca***, (2) as ***sukha***, (3) as ***atta*** (4) as ***subha***, greed-wrong view can arise consequently. The nature of wrong knowing on that visible- object (1) as ***nicca*** (2) as ***sukha*** (3) as ***atta*** (4) as ***subha*** is called delusion (***moha***). The nature of wrong belief on visible-object (1) as ***nicca*** (2) as ***sukha*** (3) as ***atta*** (4) as ***subha***, is called wrong view (=***diṭṭhi***). There are 20/19/22/21 mental ***dhammas*** in each impulsion of greed- wrong view group. It will be obvious in later.] 

If one obsesses that “the self (***atta***) is eternal, it never cease when death,” it is called eternity wrong view. If one obsesses that “the self ceases after death, there is nothing beyond coffin,” it is called annihilation wrong view. 

5. In the continuum of person who has a high esteem of himself in a way that “there is no one who can arise apparently this visible-object(=can perceive this visible-object ), except me,” conceit fetter arises consequently. [Those are unwholesome impulsions which are inclusive in greed-conceit group. There are (20/19/22/21) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** in each impulsion.] 
5. In  the  continuum  of  person  who  has  anger  with  undesirable  visible-object  which impinges in the eye-door the hatred fetter arises consequently. [The term, ***patigha***, means the nature of harshness of mind towards object. The basic meaning is hatred which desire to destroy object. There are (18/20) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** in each impulsion.] 
5. In the continuum of person who has envious mind in a way that “it will be very nice, if  no  one,  except  me,  attain  this  kind  of  visible-object,”  the  envy  fetter  (***issā samyojana***) arises consequently. [Those are mental ***dhammas*** which are inclusive in hatred-group. There are (19/21) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** in each impulsion.] 

**PAGE-216** 

8. In the continuum of person with stinginess by making his acquired visible-object so as not to concern with others the stinginess fetter arises consequently. [Those are mental ***dhammas*** which are inclusive in hatred-stinginess group. There are (19/21) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** in each impulsion.] 

[Notes:\_\_\_\_\_ As hatred-envy, hatred-stinginess mental ***dhammas*** can arise by taking visible- object as object, hatred-remorse mental ***dhammas*** can also arise by taking visible-object as object. Unwholesome ***dhammas*** can arise appropriately by taking (6) kinds of objects. Now it will be presented continuously on hatred-remorse group mental ***dhammas***. 

Hatred-remorse 

1) If  one  repentant  through  taking  visible-object  (=through  taking  object  of misdeed), which was related with visible-object, which has been done in past period, hatred-remorse arise consequently. Others’ shirt with beautiful colour was toughed wit ink so as to destroy colour. It is a kind of repentance which arise after destroying other’s beautiful visible-object. 
1) If one repentant through taking object of wholesome deeds which have not been  done  in  past  period,  remorse  arises  consequently.  It  is  a  kind  of repentance  which  arises  through  failure  of  offering  beautiful  flowers  for pagoda, due to various factors although one has intention to offer beautiful flowers a pagoda in time. There are (19/21) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** in each impulsion. 
9. In the continuum of person with sceptic in a way that “is this visible-object ( = colour of corporeal units) being? (= self (***atta***)?); is it being’s property? (=is it self’s colour?) the sceptic fetter arises consequently. (There are (16) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** in each impulsion.) 

[Notes:  \_\_\_\_\_\_  Mental  ***dhammas***  consisting  restlessness  (***uddhacca***)  are  also  object  of ***vipassanā***  practice.  They  take  (6)  kinds  of  objects  appropriately.  Therefore  if  one  has wandering mind by taking visible-object, it is called ‘***uddhacca***’ (restlessness). (There are 16 kinds of mental ***dhammas*** in each impulsion.)] 

10. Whenever  various  fetters  mentioned  above  arise,  due  to  simultaneous  occurrence within same mind moment, the ignorance fetter arises by means of nature of nescience on real ultimate nature of object(= nature of wrong knowing). 

These fetters never arise specifically but groupwise system of corporeality-mentality, ultimate nature of various associating mental ***dhammas*** within same moment as natural fixed law. Those groups of mental ***dhammas*** always arise by following the fixed route of cognitive process. Therefore the righteous ***meditator*** has to discern in order to reach up to the field of ultimate nature through breaking down (4) kinds of compactness of mentality called blocks of mentality. During discerning in that way, it will be presented on (12) kinds of unwholesome consciousness in groupwise system and in order previously so as to attain easy understanding.

In brief  it  should be  recognized  in  the  aspect  of both  wholesome  and unwholesome actions, if exhortation of oneself or others is essential, it is called prompted; if exhortation is not essential, it is called unprompted respectively.] 

**10.C  Four varieties of greed-conceit group mental *dhammas*** 

It is similar to greed-wrong view group but wrong view is replaced with conceit. There are also (20/19/22/21) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** in each impulsion. However conceit associates with greed sometimes and it does not associate with greed sometimes. If both conceit and wrong view do not associate with greed in those group rooted in greed, there will be

Exhortation \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

In  the  ***Abhidhammattha  Sangha***  it  is  explained  that  all  (29)  kinds  of  sensuous impulsions  can  fall  both  five-doors-cognitive  processes  and  mind-door-cognitive  process. The Exalted One, himself, preached in section of ***Cittanupassanā , Mahā satipaṭṭhāna Sutta*** that “***sarāgam vā cittam sarāgam cittanti pajānāti (M-1-76)*** = the consciousness with lust, the consciousness with hatred, the consciousness with delusion etc., or unwholesome mental ***dhammas*** must also be discerned as objects of ***vipassanā*** practice. According to instructions found in olden day commentary that “***tam*** ***rūpam ārammaņam katvā uppannam (Abhi-A-1- 271)*** etc., the righteous ***meditator*** must keep unwholesome mental ***dhammas*** which arise by taking object of each corporeal ***dhamma*** among (28) kinds of corporealities in mind as being. 

**PAGE-220** 

**10.F  Way  of  keeping  mental  *dhammas*  of  unwholesome  impulsions  of  mind-door- cognitive processes in mind** 

During keeping unwholesome mental ***dhammas*** which arise by taking object of each ultimate nature of corporeal ***dhamma*** in mind, some ***meditators*** are unable to understand on some group of unwholesome mental ***dhammas***, resulting in facing with difficulty. It is due to presence of habitual recurrence of taking objects of block of concept, i.e., man, woman, gold- silver etc., along with the very long rounds of rebirth. If unwholesome mental ***dhammas*** which  arise by  taking  object  of block  of  concept,  gold,  silver,  clothe  etc.,  are  discerned beforehand,  it  will  be  easily  understood.  Therefore  way  of  discerning  on  unwholesome mental  ***dhammas***  which  arise  by  taking  object  of  block  of  concept,  gold,  etc.,  will  be presented previously. Due to discerning in that way \_\_\_ 

1. unwholesome  mental  ***dhammas***  which  arise  by  taking  object  of  concept  can  be experienced to discern and 
1. unwholesome mental ***dhammas*** which arise by taking object of ultimate nature of corporeal ***dhamma*** will be easier to discern consequently. 

In this case, one should not misunderstand on the fact block of concept, gold etc., are discerned as object of ***vipassanā*** practice. It should be recognized it is similar to way of discerning  on  absorption  mental  ***dhammas***  which  arise  by  taking  object  of  concept  of ***ānāpāna paṭibhāga nimitta, kasiņa paṭibhāga nimitta*** etc. However when one can discern unwholesome  ***dhammas***  which  arise  by  taking  object  of  concept  he  has  to  discern  only unwholesome ***dhammas*** which arise by taking object of corporeal ***dhamma***. 

**Greed-wrong view group (20) kinds of mental *dhammas* on object of gold** 

1. Life-continuum  mind-clear-element  must  be  kept  in  mind  after  developing concentration step by step. 
1. Any kind of golden ring, necklace, ear-ring with a screw-on back piece, which is one’s property, must be taken as object. (It must be a thing  which is seen by the help of light of concentration.) 
1. When that object of golden thing impinges in the life-continuum mind-clear-element continuity of impulsions of mind-door-cognitive processes will arise by taking object of block of golden thing. 
1. Mind-door-adverting  which  includes  in  that  mind-door-cognitive  process  must determine  on  that  gold  as  ***subha***  (pleasant  object).  Due  to  occurrence  of  unwise attention, greed-wrong view group, unwholesome impulsions will arise consequently. 
1. ***citta*** ( = consciousness) = the nature of taking object of gold 
1. ***phassa*** ( = contact) = the nature of coming into contact with object of gold 
1. ***vedanā*** ( = feeling) = the nature of feeling (happily) on the taste of object of gold. 
1. ***saññā*** ( = perception) = the nature of making a mental note on object of gold as ***subha*** 
1. ***cetanā*** ( = volition) = the nature of exhortation on associating ***dhammas*** towards object of gold, 

**PAGE-221** 

6. ***ekaggatā***  (=  one-pointedness)  =  the  nature  of  one-pointedness  of  mind  on  single object of gold, 
   1. the nature of ability to non-spreading out of associating ***dhammas***. 
6. ***jīvita*** (= vitality) = the nature of protecting on associating ***dhammas***. 
8. ***manasikāra*** ( = attention) = the nature of attention of the mind towards object of gold 
   1. the nature of taking into heart object of gold. 
8. ***vitakka*** = the nature of initial application of the mind towards object of gold, 
8. ***vicāra***  = the nature of sustain application of the mind on object of gold, 
   1. the nature of repeated bearing in mind on the object of gold. 
8. ***adhimokkha*** = the nature of determining on the object of gold as ***subha***. 
8. ***vīriya*** = the nature of endeavouring so as to arise unwholesome deed ( = so as to arise lust), greed-wrong view etc. on the object of gold. 
8. ***pīti*** =the nature of pleasurable interest on the object of gold. 
8. ***chanda*** =the nature of heartfelt desire to attain object of gold. 
8. ***moha*** = the nature of nescience on real ***asubha*** nature of object of gold. 
8. ***ahirika*** = the nature of consciencelessness for arising of unwholesome deed, greed- wrong view etc., on the object of gold. 
8. ***anottappa*** = the nature of shamelessness for arising of unwholesome deed, greed- wrong view etc., on the object of gold. 
8. ***uddhacca*** = the nature of restlessness of mind on the object of gold. 
8. ***lobha*** = the nature of obsession on the object of gold as ‘mine’. 
   1. the nature of heartfelt desire on the object of gold. 
8. ***diṭṭhi*** = the nature of obsession on the object of gold as ‘***subha***’, 
- the nature of wrong view on the object of gold as ‘***subha***’. 

Continuity of consciousness of cognitive process must be understood \_\_\_\_ 

During determining as ‘***subha***’ by taking object of block of concept of gold, due to taking into heart block of concept called gold, it is wrong way of taking into heart as ‘***subha***’ and unwise attention, continuity of unwholesome impulsions of cognitive process, which are led by greed-wrong view, will arise. That cognitive process consists of one time of mind- door-adverting  and  (7)  times  of  impulsions.  Due  to  taking  into  heart  object  of  concept, registering is not available. However if pure colour of collectiveness of visible-object which are consisting in mass of gold is taken as object, registering is also available. 

It  should be  understood  similarly  on  obsession  on that  object  of  gold  as  ‘***nicca***’, ‘***sukha***’, ‘***atta***’. If ***pīti*** is associated, feeling will be agreeable feeling; if ***pīti*** is not associated, feeling will be neutrality feeling. If it is prompted mind so as to arise lust on the object of gold, it associates with sloth and torpor. If it is unprompted mind, it will be lacking of sloth and torpor. Each (4) varieties must be discerned thoroughly. 

**PAGE-222** 

**10.G  The ultimate nature (*paramattha sabhāva*)** 

If the righteous ***meditator*** has reached into the stage in which external corporeality- mentality, including non-living things can be discerned up to the field of ultimate nature when he discerns four great elements within that gold he will see corporeal units only. Each corporeal unit consists of eight kinds of ultimate nature of corporealities, i.e., earth-element, water-element,  fire-element,  air-element  colour,  smell,  taste,  nutriment.  Those  ultimate corporeal ***dhammas*** are group of corporealities produced by temperature (***utujarūpa***) which are  proliferating  generation  by  generation,  due  to  fire-element  occurring  within  each corporeal unit. Those ***utujarūpa*** are only corporeal ***dhammas*** which exist temporarily with very short instant about picosecond between two kinds of absence, i.e., absence before arising and absence just after arising. There is a reasonable question that if it perishes away just after 

arising very quickly, why does it exist continuously as block of gold intact. Due to presence of efficiency of benefiting factor of fire-element as cause, resultant corporeal ***dhammas*** will arise continuously through connecting between preceding ones and succeeding ones. Those persons  without  eye  of  wisdom  on  the  ultimate  nature  are  unable  to  see  that  nature  of incessant arising and perishing away of ultimate ***dhammas***, resulting in seeing as block of gold. Those ultimate nature of corporeal ***dhammas*** are, actually, nature of ***dhamma*** which arises successively under the circumstances of ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta***. 

Clothes \_\_\_\_\_ Greed-wrong view group mental ***dhammas*** can be discerned by taking object of one’s clothes. The object of new clothes is very easy to arise ***pīti*** (pleasurable interest), agreeable feeling, and unprompted mind. If it is used clothes, neutrality feeling, but not ***pīti***, will be frequent and prompted mind will arise frequently. Therefore the righteous ***meditator*** should  like  to  discern  somethings  one  owns,  new  clothes,  used  clothes  etc.,  which  are confiscated as ‘mine’. If the righteous ***meditator*** is ***abhikkhu***, he should like to discern any requisites,  new  robe,  used  robe  etc.,  which  are  confiscated  as   ‘mine’.  Compactness  of mentality must be broken down. The insight must reaches up to the field of ultimate nature of mentality. When all mental ***dhammas*** within cognitive process in sequence can be kept in mind thoroughly as a whole he must bear in mind as “mental ***dhamma***, mental ***dhamma***”. 

**10.H  Greed-conceit group (4) varieties (consciousness rooted in greed)** 

In the aspect of conventional reality \_\_\_ the nature of rivalry of one’s properties with others, gold, money, house, car, son, daughter, husband, wife, diamond ear-ring, ***dhamma***, etc., is conceit. It is not tolerant of competition of one’s property which is always impressed as upper hand. It is the nature of think highly of oneself. In this greed-conceit group the righteous ***meditator*** must discern by following above greed-wrong view group as example by taking object of any kind of concepts, gold, money, clothes etc., which usually bring forth conceit oneself. Conceit is substituted in the place of wrong view. Discern (4) varieties as mentioned above. 

**PAGE-223** 

For instance \_\_\_ Let discern by taking object of gold. Conceit is the nature of think highly on ones own gold as better than other’s gold. 

In this greed-conceit group ***vīriya*** (effort) is the nature of endeavouring so as to arise conceit;  ***chanda***  (intention)  is  the  nature  of  desire  or  wish  to  arise  conceit;  ***ahirika*** (consciencelessness) is the nature of consciencelessness to arise unwholesome deeds, greed, conceit etc.; ***anottappa*** (shamelessness) is the nature of shamelessness to arise unwholesome deeds, greed, conceit etc. 

Discern on various living and non-living objects by which one usually arises conceit through spreading knowledge as one has experience. Way of discerning in brief is \_\_\_\_ 

1. Life-continuum  mind-clear-element  must  be  kept  in  mind  after  developing concentration step by step. 
1. Any kind of diamond, ear-ring with a screw-on back piece, which is one’s property, must be taken as object. (It must be a thing which is seen by the help of light of concentration.) 
1. When that object of diamond ear-ring impinges in the life-continuum mind-clear- element  continuity  of  impulsions  of  mind-door-cognitive  processes  will  arise  by taking object of diamond ear-ring. 
4. Mind-door-adverting  which  includes  in  that  mind-door-cognitive  process  must determine on that diamond ear-ring as “my diamond ear-ring is better than others”. Due  to  occurrence  of  unwise  attention,  greed-conceit  group,  unwholesome impulsions will arise consequently. 

Conceit  usually  arises  sometimes.  Those  unwholesome  impulsions  without both  kinds  of wrong-view and conceit, which are led by greed must also be discerned through spreading knowledge as one has experience. There will be (19/21/18/20) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** in each impulsion respectively. 

**10.I  Hatred group (2) varieties (consciousness rooted in hatred)** 

1. Life-continuum  mind-clear-element  must  be  kept  in  mind  after  developing concentration step by step. 
1. Any kind of object on which hatred usually arises must be taken as object. For instance, a hate person must be taken as object. 
1. When that object of hate person impinges in the life-continuum mind-clear-element continuity  of  impulsions  of  mind-door-cognitive  processes  will  arise  by  taking object of hate person. 
1. Mind-door-adverting  which  includes  in  that  mind-door-cognitive  process  must determine  on  that  hate  person  as  “I  hate  him”.  Due  to  occurrence  of  unwise attention, hatred  group, unwholesome impulsions will arise consequently. 

The nature of wrong knowing as hate person is delusion. The nature of harshness of mind = the nature of desire to destroy object is hatred (***dosa***). Prompted and unprompted mind must be discerned. 

Hatred-envy group (2) varieties (Consciousness rooted in hatred) 

1. Life-continuum mind-clear-element must be kept in mind. 
1. Take any object of other’s thing which is better than one’s own. 

**PAGE-224** 

For instance\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ other’s diamond ear-ring which is better than one’s own must be taken as object. 

3. When  that  object  of  diamond  ear-ring  impinges  in  life-continuum  mind-clear- element\_\_\_\_\_ mind-door-adverting must take into heart in a way that “It is very nice, if she hasn’t got this kind of diamond ear-ring”. Unwholesome impulsions which are led by hatred-envy will arise consequently. Prompted and unprompted mind must be discerned. 

Hatred-stinginess  group (2) varieties (consciousness rooted in hatred) 

1. Life-continuum mind-clear-element must be kept in mind. 
1. Take any object of one’s thing which is deserving to arise stinginess. For instance\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ a razor with three blades or time-piece which usually brings forth stinginess  must be taken as object. 
1. When that object of time-piece which usually brings forth stinginess impinges in life- continuum mind-clear-element\_\_\_\_\_ mind-door-adverting must take into heart in a 

way that “It is very nice, I don’t want to give it other”. Unwholesome impulsions which are led by hatred-envy will arise consequently. Prompted and unprompted mind must be discerned. 

Let  us  suppose.  A  child  tears  other’s  book  as  nature  of  childhood.  A  kind  of intolerance, but not stinginess, arises in continuum of book owner. This nature of intolerance  to insult is also called ***micchariya***. After keeping in mind life-continuum mind-clear-element take object of that book which is torn by other mind-door-adverting must take into heart as “the  book  which  is  torn  by  other”.  Unwholesome  impulsions  which  are  led  by  hatred- stinginess will arise consequently. Prompted and unprompted mind must be discerned. 

**Hatred-remorse group (4) varieties (Consciousness rooted in hatred)** 

1. Life-continuum mind-door-element must be kept in mind. 
1. Take object of any kind of bodily misdeed which has been done. 

For instance\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ an object of action of killing mosquito must be taken as object. 

When  that  object  of  impinges  in  life-continuum  mind-clear-element  the  mind-door- adverting must take into heart as “mosquito has been killed”. Unwholesome impulsions which are led by hatred and remorse will arise consequently. Prompted and unprompted mind must be discerned. 

The righteous ***meditator*** must discern hatred-remorse group by taking object of any kind of wholesome deeds which is failure to perform in similar way. 

For instance\_\_\_\_ one has got intention to observe precepts but it is failure to observe, due to presence of any factor. In this case he has to scrutinize whether or not registerings fall after impulsions. 

**10.J. Restlessness group (1) way (Consciousness rooted in delusion)** 

1. Life-continuum mind-clear-element must be kept in mind. 
1. Take object of any kind of concepts on which one usually has got restlessness mind. 

**PAGE-225** 

For instance\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Take object of a man as object. Greed-hatred never arise by taking object of that man. But restlessness mind frequently arises relating to that man. Take object of that kind of man. When object of that man impinges in the life-continuum mind-clear- element mind-door-adverting must taking into heart as “man”. Due to occurrence of unwise attention,  continuity  of  unwholesome  impulsions  together  with  delusion,  restlessness  will arise consequently. 

The nature of wrong knowing as “man” is delusion. 

The nature of wandering mind on the object of “man” is restlessness. 

Sceptical doubt group (1) way (Consciousness rooted in delusion) 

1. Life-continuum mind-clear-element must be kept in mind. 
1. Take object of any kind of objects on which one usually has got sceptical doubt. 

For instance \_\_\_\_\_ the object which is worth arising sceptic in a way that “is it true or not whether past life had got human’s life?” must be taken as object. 

Due  to  occurrence  of  unwise  attention,  continuity  of  unwholesome  impulsions including sceptical doubts will arise consequently. These mental ***dhammas*** must be kept in mind and distinguished by insight. 

During discerning in this way registering can not fall after unwholesome impulsions which  are  led  by  hatred-remorse  group.  Because  remorse  takes  object  of  experienced unwholesome misdeeds which had been done and unexperienced wholesome deed which has not been done yet, registering can or can not fall after those impulsions with remorse. 

Afterwards  unwholesome  mental  ***dhammas***  which  arise  by  taking  object  of  each ultimate  nature  object  of  each  ultimate  nature  of  corporeal  ***dhamma***  must  be  discerned continuously. It will be presented way of discerning on unwholesome ***dhammas*** of ***dhamma***- object line previously as shown in wholesome mental ***dhammas***. 

**10.K Way of discerning on greed-wrong view group (object of eye-transparent-element)** 

1. Life-continuum mind-clear-element must be kept in mind. 
1. An eye-decad must be analyzed and eye-transparent-element must be taken as object. 
1. When that eye-transparent-element impinges in the life-continuum mind-clear-element continuity of impulsions of mind-door-cognitive process will arise consequently. Mind-door-adverting which consists in those consciousness of cognitive process must 

take  into  heart  that  eye-transparent-element  as  ‘***subha***’.  Due  to  occurrence  of  unwise attention,  mental  ***dhammas***  which  are  led  by  greed-wrong  view  will  arise  consequently. Unwise attention called ***a-yonisomanasikāra*** is proximate cause for arising of unwholwsome impulsions. 

**PAGE-226** 

It  should  be  recognized  similarly  on  other  ways  of  taking  into  heart  that  eye- transparent-element as ***nicca, sukha, atta***, it is very easy to attain in ***sampatibhava*** (complete life).  Among  (8)  kinds  of  consciousness  rooted  in  greed,  those  are  (4)  kinds  which  are associating with wrong view. 

If it associates with agreeable feeling it also  consists of ***pīti***, if it associates with neutrality  feeling,  it  does  not  consist  of  ‘***pīti***’.  If  it  is  prompted  mind,  sloth  and  torpor associate  with  it.  If  it  is  unprompted  mind,  sloth  and  torpor  are  lacking.  Numbers  of consciousness and mental concomitants within each mind moment of cognitive process will be shown in the following table. 

**Greed-conceit group** 

If one thinks highly on oneself in a way that “only I can discern ultimate nature of this eye-transparent-element”, unwholesome impulsions which are led by greed conceit will arise. Discern through (4) varieties. Sometime conceit does not associate with  those  impulsions. Sometimes both kinds of conceit and wrong view do not associate with those impulsions. Those are (4) kinds of consciousness rooted in greed which do not associate with wrong view, conceit. 

**Hatred \_\_\_** 

In the continuum of angry person, due to presence of causal ***dhamma***, not clear sight on undesirable object of eye-transparent-element which appears in the mind-door or in the continuum of unhappy person, mental ***dhammas*** which are led by hatred will arise. Prompted and unprompted mind must be discerned. 

**Hatred-envy \_\_\_\_** 

In the continuum of person with envious mind in a way that “it is very nice, if no one get this kind of eye- transparent-element, other than me”, mental ***dhammas*** which are led by hatred- envy will arise. Prompted and unprompted mind must be discerned. If very comely eye- transparent-element which is obtained by other is taken as object, it will be easier to be understood. 

**Hatred-stinginess** 

In the continuum of person who has intolerance of concerning with other for his acquired eye-transparent-element, who has stinginess on his eye-transparent-element mental ***dhammas*** which are led by hatred-stinginess will arise. Prompted and unprompted mind must be discerned. 

**Hatred-remorse** 

If  remorse  arises  through  thinking  about  experienced  misdeed  relating  to  eye- transparent-element, mental ***dhammas*** which are led by hatred-remorse will arise. Prompted and unprompted mind must be discerned. It is a kind of worry, due to failure to take medical treatment, even though one has hot intention to take medical treatment for eye-transparent- element in time. Most ***meditators*** have got difficulty to discern mental ***dhammas*** of hatred- envy group, hatred-stinginess group and hatred-remorse group by taking object of ultimate nature of eye-transparent-element in this way. It is because they have reached into the field of ultimate nature by penetrative knowledge. The righteous ***meditator*** has to discern through following above examples of arising of (10) kinds of fetters by taking visible-object. 

**PAGE-227** 

**Sceptical doubt \_\_\_\_\_** 

In the continuum of person who has got skeptical doubt in a way that “is this eye- transparent-element being (***satta***) (=self) (= property of being) (= property of self)?”, is it being’s eye-transparent-element? =is it self’s eye-transparent-element? etc., mental ***dhammas*** of  skeptical  doubt  group  will  arise.  Those  are  continuity  of  impulsions  of  mind-door- cognitive processes. 

**Restlessness \_\_\_\_** 

If  neither  greed  nor  hatred  arises  depending  on  eye-transparent-element  but restlessness only arise in one’s continuum, it is called ***uddhacca***. Those mental ***dhammas*** led by  restlessness  are  continuity  of  impulsions  of  mind-door-cognitive process. Numbers  of consciousness and mental concomitants within each mind moment of cognitive process will be shown in the following table.

Registering (***tad-arammaņa***) \_\_\_\_ 

Both kinds of registerings without root cause and with root cause are shown in table. It should not be misunderstood both kinds of registerings can arise within same cognitive process. It means any kind of registerings can fall within respective cognitive process. During falling  registerings,  generally  impulsions  and  registerings  have  got  same  feeling.  If impulsions associate with agreeable feeling, registering will also associate with agreeable feeling and so forth. However if impulsions associate with disagreeable feeling, registering cannot associate with disagreeable feeling, resulting in association with neutrality feeling. It means only registerings with neutrality feeling can fall after impulsions rooted in hatred. 

**PAGE-228** 

As shown in above table showing registerings, great consequence registerings can also  fall  after  unwholesome  impulsions  appropriately.  Due  to  unwise  attention  on  very desirable objects, the object of appearance of the Exalted One etc., unwholesome impulsions fall  consequently  and  after  those  impulsions  great  consequence  registerings  can  fall accordingly. In this work, therefore, both kinds of registerings without root cause and with root  cause  are  shown  in  table.  The  writer  hopes  that  while  the  righteous  ***meditator***  is discerning on unwholesome mental ***dhammas*** he will understand gradually. 

Those  unwholesome  group  mental  ***dhammas***  which  arise  by  taking  objects  of remaining real and non-real corporeal ***dhammas*** which are inclusive in list of ***dhamma***-object line must be discerned by following this example of way of discerning unwholesome mental ***dhammas*** which arise by taking object of eye-transparent-element. 

**General knowledge relating to registering \_\_\_\_** 

In these consciousness rooted in greed only registering with ***pīti*** and agreeable feeling is  shown,  if  impulsions  associate  with  ***pīti***  and  agreeable  feeling.  If  impulsions  do  not associate with ***pīti*** but neutrality feeling, registering with neutrality feeling is shown. 

Although impulsion and registering have got same feeling generally, if impulsions associate with disagreeable feeling (= impulsion with hatred), registering can not associate with disagreeable feeling, resulting in falling rootless neutrality investigating registering only. (***Abhi-A-1-317***) 

**Very desirable object, the appearance of Exalted One etc.,** 

As shown in table of registering after unwholesome impulsions great consequence registerings  can  also  fall  appropriately.  Objects  of  living  Exalted  One  and  stature  of  the Exalted One, pagoda etc., are very desirable objects which can bring forth proliferation of wholesome ***dhammas***. Those heretics with belief of out of ***sāsanā*** can not respect on very desirable object of those appearance of Exalted One etc., due to presence of unwise attention. When unwholesome impulsions fall depending on unwise attention on those kinds of very desirable object, Perfectly Enlightened One etc., wholesome consequence registerings can fall after those unwholesome impulsions appropriately. It is due to opportunity to encounter with  this  kind  of  very  desirable  objects  through  previous  action.  In  this  work  rootless consequence registerings are shown after unwholesome impulsions previously in tables. If great consequence registerings  are  available  after unwholesome impulsions, the righteous ***meditator*** will understand gradually during discerning on unwholesome mental ***dhammas***. Those great consequence registerings will consist of (34/33/33/32) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** appropriately. 

**PAGE-229** 

Now it will be presented on (20) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** of greed-wrong view group which arise by taking object of eye-transparent-element again for those persons with immatured knowledge. 

**10.L   Greed-wrong view group (20) kinds of mental *dhammas*** 

1. ***citta*** ( = consciousness) = the nature of taking object of eye-transparent-element 
1. ***phassa*** ( = contact) = the nature of coming into contact with object of eye-transparent- element 
1. ***vedanā*** ( = feeling) = the nature of feeling (happily) on the taste of object of eye- transparent-element. 
1. ***saññā*** ( = perception) = the nature of making a mental note on object of gold as ***subha*** 
1. ***cetanā*** ( = volition) = the nature of exhortation on associating ***dhammas*** towards object of eye-transparent-element, 
1. ***ekaggatā*** (= one-pointedness) = the nature of one-pointedness of mind on single object of eye-transparent-element, 
   1. = the nature of ability to non-spreading out of associating ***dhammas***. 
1. ***jīvita*** (= vitality) = the nature of protecting on associating ***dhammas***. 
1. ***manasikāra*** ( = attention) = the nature of attention of the mind towards object of eye- transparent-element 
   1. = the nature of taking into heart object of eye-transparent- element. 
1. ***vitakka*** = the nature of initial application of the mind towards object of eye-transparent- element, 
1. ***vicāra***  = the nature of sustain application of the mind on object of eye-transparent- element, 
   1. = the nature of repeated hearing in mind on the object of eye-transparent- element. 
1. ***adhimokkha*** = the nature of determining on the object of eye-transparent-element as ***subha***. 
1. ***vīriya*** = the nature of endeavouring so as to arise unwholesome deed ( = so as to arise lust), greed-wrong view etc. on the object of eye-transparent-element. 
1. ***pīti*** =the nature of pleasurable interest on the object of eye-transparent-element. 
1. ***chanda*** =the nature of heartfelt desire to attain object of eye-transparent-element. 
1. ***moha*** = the nature of nescience on real a***subha*** nature of object of eye-transparent- element. 
1. ***ahirika*** = the nature of consciencelessness for arising of unwholesome deed, greed- wrong view etc., on the object of eye-transparent-element. 
1. ***anottappa*** = the nature of shamelessness for arising of unwholesome deed, greed-wrong view etc., on the object of eye-transparent-element. 
1. ***uddhacca*** = the nature of restlessness of mind on the object of eye-transparent-element. 
1. ***lobha*** = the nature of obsession on the object of eye-transparent-element as ‘mine’.

20. ***diṭṭhi*** = the nature of obsession on the object of eye-transparent-element as ‘***subha***’, 
- the nature of wrong view on the object of eye-transparent-element as ‘***subha***’. 

**PAGE-230** 

[Notes: \_\_\_\_\_\_ When object of eye-transparent-element is obsessed as ***nicca, sukha,atta***, it should be understood in similar way. The nature of wrong knowing as ***nicca, sukha, atta***, or the nature of nescience on real phenomena of ***anicca, dukkha, anatta*** is delusion (***moha***). The nature of wrong belief as ***nicca, sukha, atta*** is ***ditthi*** (wrong view). If the feeling is agreeable feeling, it associates with ‘***pīti***’. If feeling is neutrality feeling, it does not associate with ‘***pīti***’. If it is prompted mind, it associates with sloth and torpor. If it is unprompted mind, it does not associate with sloth and torpor. If ***pīti*** does not arise during discerning on eye-transparent-element, it associates with neutrality feeling, resulting in consisting of (19) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. If the mind is not powerful to take object of eye-transparent- element relating to arising of greed, wrong view, it is prompted mind, resulting in associating with sloth and torpor. If sloth and torpor associate with it, numbers of mental ***dhammas*** will be (22) and (21) respectively. The righteous ***meditator*** has to practice over and over through discerning  individual  mental  ***dhamma***  in  each  mind  moment  and  discerning  all  mental ***dhammas*** within each mind moment as a whole.] 

**10.M. Consciousness rooted in greed which associate with wrong view (4) kinds \_\_\_\_\_** 

1. ***somanassa sahagata diṭṭhigata sampayutta a-sańkhārika citta***

In this table, it is shown that great consequence registerings are also available after impulsions rooted in greed. Rootless registering are also shown similarly. Among (11) kinds of  registerings  any  kind  can  fall  depending  on  desirable,  very  desirable  or  undesirable condition of object of eye-transparent-element which is taken as object by oneself. If it is moderate desirable called natural desirable one, any kind of (10) kinds of registering, i.e., (2) kinds of wholesome consequence registerings, can fall appropriately. If great consequence registerings with knowledge and ***pīti*** fall, there will be (34) kinds of mental ***dhammas***. If any kind of knowledge or ***pīti*** is lacking, there will be (33) mental ***dhammas***. If both kinds of knowledge and ***pīti*** are lacking, there will be (32) mental ***dhammas***. If registerings without root cause which associates with neutrality feeling fall, there will be (11) mental ***dhammas***, while  if  it  associates  with ***pīti***  and  agreeable  feeling,  there  will be  (12)  kinds  of  mental ***dhammas*** respectively. 

The eye-transparent-element is corporeal ***dhamma*** which is sensuous object only. If sensuous impulsions, sensuous being, sensuous object coincide and that object is obvious object, registering will be available. If unobvious object impinges in the mind-door, there is impossible to fall registering. Generally registerings usually associate with ***pīti*** and agreeable feeling arises frequently, if impulsions associate with ***pīti***. If impulsions do not associate with ***pīti***, registering also does not associate with ***pīti*** but neutrality feeling arises frequently. If impulsions are unprompted, great consequence registering will be unprompted. If impulsions are prompted, great consequence registering will also be prompted. 

**10. N. Greed-conceit group (4) varieties** 

In the  continuum of person who thinks highly himself in a way that “only  I  can discern, other persons are unable to discern object of eye-transparent-element…”, through analyzing on eye-decad, conceit fetter arises consequently. As two lions can not hide inside the  same  cave,  wrong  view  and  conceit  can  not  arise  simultaneously  within  same  mind moment. It should, therefore, be recognized while conceit is associating, wrong view will not associate in that mind moment.

**10.P. Way of discerning** 

1. Life-continuum mind-clear-element must be kept in mind. 
1. Take object of eye-transparent-element on which one usually has got conceit. 
1. When  that  object  of  eye-transparent-element  impinges  in  life-continuum  mind-clear- element mind-door-adverting or ***adhimokkha*** (determining) which associates with mind- door-adverting must take into heart and determine as “only I can discern”. 

Way of taking into heart as “only I can discern; other can not discern”, is unwise- attention. Mind-door-cognitive process including unwholesome impulsions of greed-coceit group will arise basing on that unwise-attention. Those mental ***dhammas*** must be discerned individually or as a whole. 

[Among those mental ***dhammas***\_\_\_\_\_ 

***citta*** (consciousness) is the nature of taking object of eye-transparent-element; 

***adhimokkha*** is the nature of determining as “only I can discern”; 

***moha*** is the nature of wrong knowing as “only I can discern” and so forth. 

So far as this extent, the nature of remaining mental concomitants can be understood. Due to occurrence of ***kadāci*** mental concomitant, sometimes conceit can be lacking in some cognitive process which are led by greed only. At that time, due to lack of conceit (19/21/28/ 20) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** will consist in those mind moments with pure greed but not wrong view, conceit. Although registering is shown in table, only when the object is obvious one registerings are available. 

There are (4) kinds of consciousness with wrong view, resulting in total of (8) kinds of consciousness rooted in greed. 

**Desire to existence fetter\_\_\_\_\_** 

Because this kind of very desirable eye-transparent-element is very easy to obtain in complete existence with objects, eye-transparent-element etc, in the continuum of person who has heartfelt desire to attain complete existence with various objects, eye-transparent-element etc., in future, desire to existence fetter arises consequently. That desire to existence fetter usually associates with wrong view on human existence, heavenly existence etc., generally. Sometimes  complete  existence  can  usually  be  desired  through  associating  with  conceit. Sometimes as a female heavenly being called “***Uposatha***”, desire to existence fetter which is heartfelt desire to attain complete existence in ***Tāvatimsā*** plane where very famous celestial garden called “***nandavana***”, can usually arise. (***Vimāna Vatthu-2-9***). Discern by following on examples as one’s experience and knowledge. 

**PAGE-234** 

In this case (4) kinds of consciousness rooted in greed, which associate with wrong view concern with various enormous aspects. Various wrong views are inclusive in those (4) kinds of consciousness. Even though those consciousness concern with how various aspects, if  those  consciousness  with  wrong  view  which  arise  by  taking  object  of  (28)  kinds  of corporealities can be discerned up to the field of ultimate nature after braking down each compactness,  this  work  accepts  it  is  sufficient  for  practising  ***meditator***  who  performs ***vipassanā*** practice. 

Rules and rites fetter called ***sīlabbata parāmāsa samyojana*** is, actually, very difficult ***dhamma*** in order to arise in the continuum of virtuous persons who are disciples of the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One. As ***Puņņa*** and ***Seniya***  who can be found in ***Kukkuravatika Sutta*** (***M-2-50,54***), only in the continuum of person who practices ***sīlabbata*** way through thinking in a way that “if rules and rites practice called cow’s practice, dog’s practice can be accomplished, it will be possible to attain these objects with this nature, eye-transparent- element etc”, this rules and rites fetter can arise. 

***Pāli Quotation (M-A-2-71,72)*** 

- Because it is the opinion which arises through obsessing on the way of practice which can not lead to joyful existences of heavenly being  etc, as way of practice  leading to joyful existence, that rules and rite fetter of that person who practices rules and rites is called wrong view. (***M-A-2-71,72***) 

**10.Q. Hatred group (2) varieties** 

1. [***domanassa  sahagata  paṭighasampayutta  a-sańkhārika  citta***  =  unprompted consciousness which associates with hatred;] 
1. [***domanassa sahagata paṭighasampayutta sa-sańkhārika citta*** = prompted consciousness which associates with hatred;] 

There are two kinds of consciousness rooted in hatred. 

The  term, ***paṭigha***,  means  nature  of  harshness  of  mind.  The basic  meaning  is  hatred (=anger). Hatred is also the nature of desire to destroy object. If it is prompted mind by himself or other, it is called ***sa-sańkhārika***. If hatred arises without prompting, it is called ***a- sańkhārika***.  

Way of discerning is as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

1. Life-continuum mind-clear-element must be kept in mind. 
1. Take object of eye-transparent-element on which one usually has got hatred and it is undesirable object. 
1. When  that  object  of  eye-transparent-element  impinges  in  life-continuum  mind-clear- element mind-door-adverting or ***adhimokkha*** (determining) which associates with mind- door-adverting must take into heart and determine as “undesirable object”. 

**PAGE-235** 

Due  to  occurrence  of  unwise  attention,  continuity  of  impulsions  of  mind-door- cognitive process including hatred will arise. 

Each impulsion consists of (18) kinds of mental ***dhammas***, if it is unprompted mind; each impulsion consists of (20) kinds of mental ***dhammas***, if it is prompted mind. 

[Among those mental ***dhammas***\_\_\_\_\_ 

***citta*** (consciousness) is the nature of taking object of eye-transparent-element; 

***adhimokkha*** is the nature of determining as “undesirable object”; 

***moha*** is the nature of wrong knowing as “undesirable object” and so forth. 

So far as this extent, the nature of remaining mental concomitants can be understood. 

***aniṭṭha*** (undesirable object) \_\_\_\_\_\_ 

Even though that object of eye-transparent-element might be whatever kind of either naturally  undesirable  one  or  naturally  desirable  one,  the  way  of  taking  into  heart  as “undesirable one” plays important role in falling of impulsions with hatred.

|2 |Take into heart as ***aniṭṭha*** = 12 |20 |11   (or) |33 / 32 (***upekkhā***) |
In above table the reason why registerings are available after impulsion with hatred is especially  refered  to  only  worldly  human  who  has  got  ***paṭisandhi***  with  three  roots  and neutrality feeling. In the continuum of only that kind of person with ***paṭisandhi*** associating with neutrality feeling, neutral registerings can fall after impulsion with hatred appropriately. By taking desirable object (5)  kinds of registerings, i.e. one  kind of  rootless wholesome consequence  neutral  investigating  registering  and  (4)  kinds  of  great  consequence  neutral registering can fall. By taking undesirable object rootless unwholesome consequence neutral investigating registering, one kind only, can fall after impulsions with hatred. 

**PAGE-236** 

[Notes: \_\_\_\_ Please see again on general knowledge about registerings shown in this volume page (125) etc. According to Venerable ***Ledi Sayadaw***, if impulsions with hatred fall through unwise attention by taking desirable and very desirable objects, (4) kinds of great consequence  neutral  registerings  can  fall  through  performing  function  of  guest  life- continuum. It should be recognized on coming hatred-envy group, hatred-stinginess group hatred-remorse group in similar way]. 

Hatred-envy group (2) varieties 

***issā*** = the nature of envy on other’s eye-transparent-element through considering in a way that “it is very nice, if no one can get this kind of eye-transparent-element”; (This is refered especially how envy arise by taking object of eye-transparent-element only). 

Those two kinds of consciousness of hatred-envy group are inclusive in consciousness rooted in hatred. There are also two kinds, prompted and unprompted mind. 

Way of discerning 

1. Life-continuum mind-clear-element must be kept in mind. 
1. Take object of other’s eye-transparent-element on which one usually has got envy. 
1. When  that  object  of  eye-transparent-element  impinges  in  life-continuum  mind-clear- element mind-door-adverting or ***adhimokkha*** (determining) which associates with mind- door-adverting must take into heart and determine as “unless this kind of eye-transparent- element is available for her, it is very nice” 

Due to occurrence of unwise attention, continuity of impulsions which are led by hatred- envy group will arise. Each impulsion will consist of 

1. (19) kinds of mental ***dhammas***, if it is unprompted mind; 
1. (21) kinds of mental ***dhammas***, if it is prompted mind respectively. 

Due to adding with envy into previous hatred group mental ***dhammas*** (18/20), there will be (19/21) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** respectively. This kind of mind is, actually, the nature of envy on other’s acquired eye, which always dissatisfies so as not to attain that kind of beautiful eye for others.

In  registering,  number  (11)  means  rootless  unwholesome  consequence  neutral investigating  registering  mental  ***dhammas***  which  arise  by  taking  undesirable  object  and rootless wholesome consequence neutral investigating registering mental ***dhammas*** which arise by taking desirable object respectively. Those numbers of (33/32) are consisting in great consequence neutral registering mind moments. Registering is available after impulsions with hatred in the continuum of person who has got ***paṭisandhi*** with neutrality feeling. 

In the continuum of persons with opinion of out of ***sāsanā*** when hatred-envy group ***dhammas*** arise by taking very desirable objects, the object of appearance of the Exalted One etc., if object is also obvious one, great consequence neutral registerings are available. If one has got ***paṭisandhi*** with agreeable feeling originally, (5) kinds of wholesome consequence neutral registerings can fall after impulsions with hatred through performing function of guest life-continuum  after  taking  any  kind  of  sensuous  objects  which  had  been  experienced frequently in past period. 

Hatred-stinginess group (2) varieties 

***macchariya***  =  the  nature  of  stinginess  for  others  through  making  one’s  object  of  eye- transparent-element so as not to concern with others  

- the nature of intolerance of one’s object of eye-transparent-element so as not to 

concern with others; 

The nature of heart felt attachment and non-desire to abandon object is greed (***lobha***). This ‘***macchariya***’ is the nature of intolerance of one’s property like eye-transparent-element so as not to concern with others. For instance Let us suppose.\_\_\_ A child tears other’s book as nature of childhood. A kind of intolerance, but not stinginess, arises in continuum of book owner. This nature of intolerance  to insult is also called ***micchariya***.**  

Way of discerning 

1. Life-continuum mind-clear-element of oneself must be kept in mind. 
1. Take object of one’s eye-transparent-element on which one usually has got stinginess. 
1. When  object  of  that  eye-transparent-element  impinges  in  one’s  life-continuum  mind- clear-element continuity of mind-door-cognitive processes will arise consequently. 

**PAGE-238** 

4. Mind-door-adverting  which  consists  in  that  continuity  of  consciousness  of  cognitive process must take into heart as “don’t concern with others”; Or take into heart as “this eye-transparent-element must not be concerned with others”; Or take into heart as “my eye must not be concerned with others”. 

Due to occurrence of unwise-attention, impulsions of mind-door-cognitive process, which are led by hatred-stinginess will arise consequently. Each impulsion will consists of  

1. (19) kinds of mental ***dhammas***, if it is unprompted mind; 
1. (21) kinds of mental ***dhammas***, if it is prompted mind respectively.

During discerning on these hatred-stinginess group mental ***dhammas*** by taking object of  ultimate  nature  like  eye-transparent-element  most  ***meditator***s  face  with  difficulty. However it is found that they are very easy to discern through taking visible-object, colour of numerous corporeal units. 

For instance \_\_\_ it is similar to the nature of intolerance, due to destroying of one’s colour of shirt by touching with ink of others behavior. Similarly \_\_\_ it is found that they are very easy to discern through taking object of sound etc. When objects of blocks of concepts of living and non-living things, one’s own property etc., are taken as object it is easier to discern than other  kinds  of  objects.  Therefore  if  one  faces  with  difficulty,  he  has  to  discern  through changing from easy objects to difficult objects gradually. When one has got mastery he will be  successful.  Registering  is  refered  for  only  the  person  who  has  got  ***paṭisandhi***  with neutrality feeling. If one is the person who has got ***paṭisandhi*** with agreeable feeling, guest life-continuums can fall. 

Hatred-remorse group (4) varieties 

***kukkucca*** = (a) the nature of remorse depending on unwholesome misdeed relating to eye- transparent-element 

(b) the nature of remorse depending on wholesome deed, which has not be done 

yet, which is relating to eye-transparent-element 

**PAGE-239** 

1) It  is  the  nature  of  worry,  unhappiness  with  remorse  by  taking  object  of  the  eye- transparent-element  in  a  way  that  “this  is  wrong  bodily  action,  this  is  wrong  verbal action” etc. Prompted and unprompted mind must be discerned. 
1) It is the nature of worry, unhappiness with remorse by taking object of eye-transparent- element on which wholesome deed has not been done and thinking in a way that “this is wrong not to do in this way, this is wrong not to practise in this way”. Prompted and unprompted mind must be discerned. 

Way of discerning 

1. Life-continuum mind-clear-element of oneself must be kept in mind. 
1. Take object of one’s eye-transparent-element on which one usually has got remorse. 
1. When  object  of  that  eye-transparent-element  impinges  in  one’s  life-continuum  mind- clear-element continuity of mind-door-cognitive processes will arise consequently. 
1. Mind-door-adverting  which  consists  in  that  continuity  of  consciousness  of  cognitive process must take into heart as “this is wrong bodily action”; Or take into heart as “this is wrong not to do in this way”; “this is wrong not to do in this way”. 

Due to occurrence of unwise-attention, impulsions of mind-door-cognitive process, which are led by hatred-remorse will arise consequently. Each impulsion will consists of  

1. (19) kinds of mental ***dhammas***, if it is unprompted mind; 
1. (21) kinds of mental ***dhammas***, if it is prompted mind respectively. 

Because these hatred-remorse group mental ***dhammas*** can also be discerned by taking object of ultimate nature, some ***meditator*** can face with difficulty. At that time as mentioned in hatred-stinginess group, the practising ***meditator*** has to try from easy way of discerning to difficult one gradually. There are also two kinds of consciousness in this group, prompted and unprompted ones. 

1. The envious mind with a such kinds of thinking that “this kind of rabbit is present in every bush”, “every bird is beautiful as brown fish-owl”, etc., is the nature of ***issā***. 
1. The  stingy  mind  with  a  kind  of  thinking  that  “don’t  touch!  It  will  lead  to  dire consequences”, 
1. The worry mind with such kinds of thinking that “something is wrong”, “he has gone poor fellow!” etc., is the nature of ***kukkucca***. 

**PAGE-240** 

Now ways of discerning on two kinds of consciousness rooted in hatred are finished through discerning on these four groups, i.e., 

1. hatred group, 
1. hatred-envy group, 
1. hatred-stinginess group, 
1. hatred-remorse group. 

Although commentary of ***Mūlapaņņāsa (M-A-1-292)*** does not explain on ***kukkucca*** in explanation of how (10) kinds of fetters arise by taking visible-object, hatred-remorse group mental ***dhammas*** are shown in this work, due to presence of sayings in ***Abhidhamma*** that … 

1. (55) kinds of impulsions are available in the mind-door-cognitive processes, 
1. all kinds of sensuous impulsions are available in five-doors-cognitive processes eye-door- cognitive process etc., respectively.

1. Discern two ways of discerning, unprompted and prompted mind by taking object of experienced unwholesome misdeed relating with eye-transparent-element. 
1. Discern two ways of discerning, unprompted and prompted mind by taking object of unexperienced wholesome deed relating with eye-transparent-element. 

Therefore there are (4) ways of discerning in hatred-remorse group in total. 

To be noticed \_\_\_\_\_\_ 

In above section of way of determining on impulsion and registering (page-141, etc.) it has been presented about guest life-continuum. If the practising ***meditator*** is the person who has got ***paṭisandhi*** with agreeable feeling and three roots, registerings are not available after impulsions with hatred mentioned above groups but guest life-continuum can fall after those impulsions. 

**PAGE-241** 

It is essential to be precise during keeping mental ***dhammas*** in mind for this stage really. If the righteous ***meditator*** is the person who has got ***paṭisandhi*** with neutrality feeling and three roots (=there are (33) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** in ***paṭisandhi*** without ***pīti***), neutral registerings can also fall appropriately as shown in tables. It should be recognized on five- doors-cognitive-processes in similar way. 

**10.R. Consciousness rooted in delusion (2) varieties** 

1. ***upekkhāsahagata  viccikicchā-sampayutta  citta***,  =  consciousness  associated  with neutrality feeling and skeptical doubt. 
1. ***upekkhāsahagata uddhacca-sampayutta citta***, = consciousness associated with neutrality feeling and restlessness. 

Thus there are only two kinds of consciousness rooted in delusion. Due to lack of greed-hatred causes or roots but delusion only, it is designated as consciousness rooted in delusion (***mohamūla citta***). 

***vicikicchā*** = the nature of skeptical doubt on eye-transparent-element in such ways that “is this  transparent-element  being?”,  “is  it  ***atta***?”,  “is  it  being’s  property?”,   “is  it  ***atta***’s property?” “is it transparent-element of ***atta***?” etc. 

(16) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** with skeptical doubt are … 

1. ***citta*** (consciousness) = the nature of taking object of eye-transparent-element  ……   1, 
1. both sides mental concomitants without ***adhimokkha, pīti, chanda*** …………    10, 
1. ***moha, ahirika, anottappa, uddhacca***  ………..   4, 
1. ***viccikicchā*** (skeptical doubt)  ………..    1, in total ……….  16 

Way of discerning 

1. Life-continuum mind-clear-element of oneself must be kept in mind. 
1. Take  object  of  one’s  eye-transparent-element  on  which  one  usually  has  got  skeptical doubt. 
1. When  object  of  that  eye-transparent-element  impinges  in  one’s  life-continuum  mind- clear-element continuity of mind-door-cognitive processes will arise consequently. 
1. Mind-door-adverting  which  consists  in  that  continuity  of  consciousness  of  cognitive process must take into heart as “Is this eye-transparent-element ***atta***?”. Or take into heart as “is it ***atta***’s property?”; “is it ***atta***’s transparent-element? ”. 

**PAGE-242** 

Due  to  occurrence  of  unwise-attention,  continuity  of  unwholesome  impulsions  of mind-door-cognitive process which are led by skeptical doubt will arise apparently. Each impulsion consists of (16) kinds of mental ***dhammas***.

Way of discerning on restlessness group mental ***dhammas*** 

***uddhacca*** = the nature of restlessness on object of eye-transparent-element 

1. Life-continuum mind-clear-element of oneself must be kept in mind. 
1. Take object of one’s eye-transparent-element on which one usually has got restlessness. 
1. When  object  of  that  eye-transparent-element  impinges  in  one’s  life-continuum  mind- clear-element continuity of mind-door-cognitive processes will arise consequently. 
1. Mind-door-adverting  which  consists  in  that  continuity  of  consciousness  of  cognitive process must take into heart as “an object which is worth wandering object”. 

Due to occurrence of unwise attention, continuity of unwholesome impulsions which are led by restlessness will arise apparently. Each impulsion consists of (16) kinds of mental ***dhammas***, viz., 

1. ***citta*** (consciousness) = the nature of taking object of eye-transparent-element ……  1, 
1. both sides mental concomitants without  ***pīti, chanda***  …………  11, 
1. ***moha, ahirika, anottappa, uddhacca***  ………..   4, in total ………..  16 

**PAGE-243** 

During discerning on mental ***dhammas*** of consciousness rooted in delusion which are led by restlessness that object must be capable of bringing forth restlessness of mind but neither greed nor hatred. It is because those kinds of restlessness already which associate with greed and  hatred  are  already  included  in  those  groups  respectively.  In  this  case  the  righteous ***meditator*** must choose any kind of object which can bring forth restlessness, object of eye- transparent-element  etc.,  which  can  not  bring  forth  greed  or  hatred.  It  means  nature  of restlessness, due to any circumstance of eye. In this group, ***moha*** (=delusion) is the nature of wrong knowing as my eye- transparent-element etc.

**10.5 General knowledge relating to registering consciousness** 

According to opinion of ***mahādhamma***-***rakkhita Mahā Thero,*** \_\_ 

1. Through taking desirable-object (=very desirable-object) after impulsions rooted in delusion which might be whatever kind, skeptical doubt presence or not: restlessness arising  or  not;  only  wholesome  consequence  rootless  agreeable  investigating registering is available. 
1. Through  taking  moderate  desirable  object  (=  desirable-object)  only  rootless wholesome consequence neutral investigating registering is available (***Abhi-A-1-317***) According to ***samānavāda***, the opinion which is agreed with all noble teachers \_\_\_\_ 
1. through taking undesirable-object after two kinds of impulsions rooted in delusion, rootless unwholesome consequence neutral investigating registering is available. 
1. through  taking  ordinary  desirable-object  which  is  designated  as  both  two  terms, ***iṭṭhārammaņa,  iṭṭhamajjattārammaņa***,  if  impulsions  rooted  in  delusion  fall,  (10) kinds  of  registering,  viz.,  one  kind  of  rootless  wholesome  consequence  agreeable investigating  registering,  one  kind  of  rootless  wholesome  consequence  neutral investigating registering, (8) kinds of great consequence registering are available after those impulsions. 
1. through taking very desirable-objects, the eye-transparent-element of the Exalted One, eye-transparent-elements of male and female heavenly beings etc., if impulsion rooted in  delusion  fall,  (5)  kinds  of  registering,  viz.,  one  kind  of  rootless  wholesome consequence agreeable investigating registering and (4) kinds of great consequence registering  are  available.  (See  section  of  cognitive  process,  ***tadārammaņavara***, ***Abhidhammattha Sangaha***) 

It should be recognized on how registering fall after unwholesome impulsions which arise by taking object of remaining corporeal ***dhammas*** in similar way. 

**PAGE-244** 

**10.T The fact to be careful especially** 

In this section although it is shown only one kind of mind-door-cognitive process as example, the righteous ***meditator*** has to understand previously the fact numerous mind-door- cognitive  processes  which  can  know  objects,  eye-transparent-element  etc.,  can  arise  by separation of many life-continuums between them. When mental ***dhammas*** of life-continuum can be kept in mind in one day those mental ***dhammas*** must also be kept in mind minglingly. Now only many mind-door-cognitive processes must be kept in mind systematically. 

In  this  stage because  the practicing ***meditator***  is  unable  to  discern  life-continuum systematically, the latter is omitted in tables showing mind-door-cognitive process. When the righteous  ***meditator***  reaches  into  stage  of  dependent-origination  (=the  Knowledge  of Discerning  Cause  and  Condition)  he  can  keep  object of  impulsions  adjacent  to  death  of previous life in mind, resulting in ability to know object of life-continuum systematically. It is because those consciousness called ***paṭisandhi***, life-continuum, death, which are inclusive in recent life or any life always take object of only impulsions adjacent to death of respective past lives continuously. Only when object of life-continuum can be known systematically can he  discern  mental  ***dhammas***  of  life-continuum  systematically.  At  that  time  when corporeality-mentality are kept in mind again life-continuum mental ***dhammas*** must also be kept in mind minglingly. Numerous mind-door-cognitive processes must also be kept in mind again. 

Now it has been presented on ways of discerning on (12) kinds of unwholesome consciousness, viz.,  

1. (8) kinds of consciousness rooted in greed, 
1. (2) kinds of consciousness rooted in hared,

**If impulsions are kept in mind as priority** 

In  above  section  of  ways  of  discerning  on  sensuous  mental  ***dhammas***  ways  of discerning  on  mentality  are  presented  through  leading  towards  (8)  kinds  of  wholesome impulsions and (12) kinds of unwholesome impulsions. Although impulsions are shown as leader, functions keeping in mind on those ***dhammas***, viz. 

1. mere functioning indeterminate ***dhammas*** (***kriyāvyākata*** ***dhamma***) called five-doors- adverting, mind-door-adverting ( = determining) and 
1. consequence  indeterminate  ***dhammas***  (***vipāka  avyākata  dhamma***)  called  five  fold consciousness, seeing-consciousness etc., receiving, investigating, registering, have also been finished together with impulsions. It is called ***avinābhāva naya*** (=inevitable method).  Those  are  sensuous  mental  ***dhammas***  which  are  worth  arising  in  the continuum of righteous person. However practice of ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*** has not been finished and it will be presented continuously. Those real corporealities and non-real corporealities  which  must  also  be  discerned  as  shown  in  way  of  discerning  on unwholesome impulsions through taking object of eye-transparent-element.

[Notes: Real corporealities which are inclusive in list of ***dhamma***-object line, including eye- transparent-element,  are  (11)  kinds  in  total.  The  righteous  ***meditator***  must  select  real corporeality which is intended to discern through analyzing on respective corporeal units. Among  those  corporealities,  ***meditator***  must  discern  only  virility  internally  and  female ***meditator*** must discern only femininity internally. For external continuum both kinds of sex- corporealities can be discerned as a whole, due to same occurrence as external object.

***Pāli Quotation (dvārasangaha, Abhidhammattha)*** 

In above commentary called compendium of ***Abhidhamma***, it is explained that (29) kinds  of  all  sensuous  impulsions  can  fall  in  five-doors-cognitive  processes,  eye-door- cognitive processes etc. Among those (29) kinds of impulsions, in the continuum of righteous ***meditator***  who  is  still  in  the  stage  of  worldly  person  with  three  roots,  (12)  kinds  of unwholesome impulsions and (8) kinds of great wholesome impulsions can fall appropriately. Among those impulsions ways of discerning on great wholesome impulsions of five-doors- cognitive processes and mind-door-cognitive process are already presented in above sections. Now  ways  of  discerning  on  mental  ***dhammas***  which  are  occurring  in  unwholesome impulsions of five-doors-cognitive process will be presented continuously. 

**11.B   Factors of falling of unwholesome impulsions with wrong view *Pāli Quotation (Abhi-A-1-290)*** 

During arising of unwholesome ***dhammas*** which are associating with wrong view \_\_ due to these factors, viz., 

1. availability to listen ***dhammas*** of heretics with wrong view 
1. association with scoundrels and vicious persons, 
1. non-desire to see Noble Ones and virtuous persons, the Exalted One etc., 
1. unwise attention, 

it should be recognized wrong philosophy (***micchā dassana***) arises in the continuum of a worldly person. 

**PAGE-247** 

1. ***a-saddhammasavana*** \_\_\_ 

In the Noble Admonishment of the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, three kinds of right  ***dhammas***  called  ***pariyattisaddhamma***  (=  learning  and  teaching  scriptures  in right way of ***dhamma***), ***paṭipatti*** ***saddhamma*** (= practicing through  following the instructions found in right ***dhamma***), ***paṭiveda*** ***saddhamma*** (= realization on Supra- mundane  ***dhammas***  through  emancipating  from  defilements)  exist  really.  Out  of ***sāsanā***,  actually,  vicious  person’s  ***dhammas***  called  ***a-saddhamma***,  which  are contradictory  to  three  kinds  of  right  ***dhammas***  of  the  Exalted  One,  which  are associating with wrong view, are present apparently. 

Due to presence of listening to those vicious person’s ***dhammas*** through cherishing on those wrong ***dhammas*** without ignoring but the mind without reasoning\_\_\_

Due  to  approaching  and  association  with  those  false  friends  who  are vicious person through inclination towards in a way that  “his speech is right; his action is right,” after thinking highly on those vicious persons \_\_\_ 
2. Due to occurrence of a person who has non-desire to see and approach towards both Noble Ones, the Exalted One etc., and virtuous person called ***sappurisa***- 
2. Due to occurrence of a person who is not mastery in ***dhammas*** with (37) varieties of factors of association of Enlightenment (***bodhipakkiya*** ***dhamma***), which are called ***ariya dhamma***, Four kinds of Mindfulness Foundations etc., 
2. Due  to  occurrence  of  contradiction  with  both  (5)  kinds  of  restraints  ***dhammas*** (***samvaradhamma***),  Noble  One’s  ***dhammas***  called  ***ariyadhamma***,  and  virtuous person’s ***dhammas*** called ***sappurisa dhammas***, (5) kinds of restraints ***dhammas*** are as follows\_\_\_ 
1) ***pātimokkhasamvara*** =  restraining  with  moral  conducts  in  accordance  with Monastic Codes preached by the Exalted One, 
1) ***indriyasamvara*** = restraining with (6) kinds of controlling faculties called eye, ear,  nose,  tongue,  body,  heart  so  as  not  to  arise  vicious  unwholesome ***dhammas***,  covetousness  (***abhijjhā***),  disagreeable  feeling  (***domanassa***),  etc, basing on (6) kinds of objects, 
1) ***satisamvara*** = tolerance with mindfulness when one is oppressed by opposite ***dhammas***, cold, hot climate etc.,  

[***satisamvaroti  idha  sītādīhi  phuṭṭhasa  appamajjanam  khamanam daṭṭabbam. (Mūlaṭī-1-119)***] 

[***“cakkhundriye samvaramājajjatī tī ādīsu satisamvaro”. (M-A-1-65)*** 

It means in this, case, even though restraints with mindfulness so as not to arise covetousness disagreeable feeling etc., relating to (6) kinds of controlling faculties can be said ***satisamvara***, due to that kind of restraint has already been said in ***indriyadamvara***, it is not worth inferring as ***satisamvara***.]

various  unwholesome  consciousness  which  associate  with  wrong  view  arise consequently. (***Abhi-A-1-290***) 

These  factors  support  in  order  to  arise  not  only  wrong  view  but  also  other unwholesome  ***dhammas***.  Now  it  will  be  presented  on  wise  attention-  unwise  attention worldly custom etc., continuously. 

**11.C  *yonisomanasikāra* (wise attention) *a-yonisomanasikāra* (unwise attention) *Pāli Quotation (M-A-1-66, 67)*** 

The attention (***manasikāra***) which is factor of arising of wholesome ***dhammas***, in other words, the proper way of taking into heart so as to arise wholesome ***dhammas***, is called ***yonisomanasikāra*** (wise attention). The following ways of taking into heart….. 

1. on  ***dukkhasacca***  ***dhamma***,  ***samudaya***  ***sacca***  ***dhamma***  as  ***anicca***,  ***dukkha***,  ***anatta***, ***asubha***, 
1. the arising of ***vipassanā*** wholesome impulsions called ***saccanulomika*** by means of adaptability to know and see penetratively on Four Noble Truths ***dhammas***, including unconditioned  element,  eternal peace  called ***nibbāna***  through  the  Path-Knowledge and Fruit-Knowledge 
1. bringing  forth  to  rotate  continuity  of  life-continuum; bringing  forth  to  rotate  life- continuum over and over again by mind-door-adverting; taking into heart nature of ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta*** of conditioned things, other than object of life-continuum; bearing in mind those nature of ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta*** well; taking into heart those nature of ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta*** of conditioned things so as to tie with its adverting continuously  by  means  of  adaptability  to  know  and  see  Four  Noble  Truths penetratively are called ***yonisomanasikāra*** (wise attention). Due to efficiency of that wise attention the righteous practicing person is able to know and see, realize on Four Noble Truths. (See ***M-ṭī-1-149***) 

**PAGE-249** 

Way of taking into heart in order to arise unwholesome ***dhammas*** but not wholesome ***dhammas***,  in  other  words,  wrong  way  of  taking  into  heart  so  as  to  arise  unwholesome ***dhamma***  but  not  wholesome  ***dhamma***  is  called  ***a-yonisomanasikāra***  (unwise  attention). These wrong ways of taking into heart on ***dukkhasacca*** ***dhamma***, ***samudayasacca*** ***dhamma***, 

1. as ***nicca***, 
1. as ***sukha***, 
1. as ***atta***, 
1. as ***subha***, are also called a-***yonisomanasikāra***. 
5. Bringing forth to rotate continuity of life continuum over and over again by means of inadaptability  to  know  and  see  Four  Noble  Truths  penetratively  by  mind-door- adverting;  taking  into  heart  the  object  which  is  not  conformed  with  penetrative knowing and seeing on Four Noble Truths; bearing in mind that unsuitable object; taking into heart that unsuitable object only so as to tie with its adverting continuously are also called a***yonisomanasikāra*** (unwise attention). (***M-A-1-66,67***) 

The wrong way of taking into heart the object which is encountered so as not to be adaptable to know and see penetratively on Four Noble Truths has the basic factors, listening vicious person’s ***dhamma***, association with scoundrels and vicious persons etc. Therefore there is a question that “it is no need to say unwise attention as specific one among factors of arising of unwholesome ***dhammas***, wrong view etc?” The answer is so follows:\_\_\_\_\_ 

The basic meaning of ***ayonisomanasikāra*** is adverting (***āvajjana***) which is consisting in cognitive process. (It is accomplished through preaching methodology of ***taggatika***.) (See page 45). If that adverting performs improper way of taking into heart (=unwise attention), unwholesome impulsions arise consequently. Thus due to occurrence of proximate cause but not  distant  causes,  as  listening  on  vicious  person’s  ***dhamma***  etc.,  unwise  attention  is explained as specific cause for arising of unwholesome ***dhammas***. 

**PAGE-250** 

Furthermore  previous  factors,  listening  on  vicious  person’s  ***dhamma***  etc.,  are  not certain  factors  of  arising  of  unwholesome  deeds.  Although  one  listens  vicious  person’s ***dhamma*** and one has association with scoundrels the person with reasoning knowledge can arise wholesome deed. Only when impulsions of one cognitive process are available and unwise attention arises in him unwholesome deed can arise certainly. Due to occurrence of certain  factor  for  arising  of  unwholesome  deed,  the  commentator  Sayadaw  explained ***ayonisomanasikāra*** as specific factor. 

***āsannakāraņattā ayonisomanasikārassa visum gahanam ekantakāraņattā ca. (Mūlaṭī-1- 119)*** 

Nowadays  these  opinions,  such  as  “no  next  coming-into-existence;  wholesome  and unwholesome deeds, wholesome result, unwholesome result which are deserving to do for parents  are  absent;  there  is  no  action  and  consequence  of  action”  etc.  are  opposite  of ***saddhamma*** and are wrong ***dhammas*** (***a-sadhamma***). If those persons with original right view  knowledge  listen  or  read  those  speech  and  writing  of  ***asaddhamma***  as  general knowledge only through reasoning whether it is right or wrong after careful thought, wrong view  cannot  arise  in  continuum  of  those  persons.  Those  persons  with  un-experienced  in ***saddhamma***, however, listen or read those speech and writing of those wrong opinions as cherishable and agreeable ones without reasoning any more. If one obsesses as “there is no action and consequence of action” through listening or reading in that way, consciousness with wrong view arise consequently. 

**11.D  *kotūhalamangalādipasuta*** 

In the world the opinion that “if an unusual thing is encountered and experienced to see, hear, smell, eat, touch it, it is blessing and benefit will be attained”, bring forth rejection of consequences of action-knowledge-effort. Therefore those persons with practice on that opinion usually become heretics who reject action and consequence of action. 

Nowadays the person who practices and memorizes olden days writings of Myanmar people, such as “travelling on auspicious day can benefit, travelling on ill-fated day can be dangerous” etc., deduces in a way that good consequence or bad consequence can be obtained through performing respective functions on that day, in that month. Due to presence of that opinion,  if  he  obsesses  in  such  way  that  “consequences  are  not  resulted  from  action- knowledge-effort but are resulted from exact time of hour, day and date only,” the wrong view  which  rejects  action  and  consequence  of  action  can  arise  in  the  continuum  of  that person.  However  if  one  does  not  reject  efficiency  of  action-knowledge-effort  through presuming in a way that “ those exact times of hour, day, date and month are only supporting factor” after studying in that way, wrong  opinion can not arise.  It should be recognized similarly  on  those  kinds  of  opinions,  such  as  “bathing  day  must  be  Sunday,  Tuesday, Thursday”,  “don’t bathe on  Wednesday,  Saturday”,  “hair  cutting should not be  made on birth-day Friday, Monday”.
