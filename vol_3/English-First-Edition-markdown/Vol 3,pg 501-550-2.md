For impulsions and registering mind-moments of the mind-door-cognitive process, it must  be  discerned  similarly  to  way  of  discerning  of  impulsions  and  registering  mind- moments of the eye-door-cognitive process.  Furthermore  associating mental ***dhammas*** of both  sides  of  cause  and  result  must be  discerned  minglingly  when ***vipassanā*** practice  is performed. It should be discerned remaining doors, ear-door etc, by taking example. Causal and resultant ***dhammas*** of every mind-moment for both wholesome groups and unwholesome groups of (6) lines shown in tables of ***nāmakammţţhāna***, must be discerned thoroughly. It is similar  to  the  way  of  discerning  shown  in  the  fifth  method  of  dependent-origination, i.e.,\_\_\_\_\_ 1.  Due to arising of the eye-contact (8), the feeling-aggregate arise. 

The eye-contact (8) are causal ***dhammas***; the feeling-aggregate is resultant ***dhamma***. 

**2.9.7 The efficiency of contact (*phassa*)** 

The  eye-contact  usually  benefits  those  feelings  occurring  in  four  kinds  of  realms called  sensual-fine  material-immaterial-Supra-mundane  until  the  Path-Knowledge  and  the Fruit-Knowledge by means of both ***upamissaya koti*** (efficiency of relation of determinative dependence), ***samatikkama*** (practicing for overcoming defilements) and the efficiency of practice. 

1. ***upanissaya koti*** \_\_\_\_\_ Because the practicing ***meditator*** with the internal preference of emancipation from round of rebirth received a good information that "if a ***kasiņa***-object is seen, this preliminary object of ***kasiņa*** can be developed until the absorption called ***jhāna*** and then  if  the  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  with  the  fundamental  factor  of  absorption  can  be developed, the Fruit-Knowledge of Arahant could be reached", \_\_\_\_\_ he endeavours to attain the purification of virtue called ***sīlavisuddhi*** previously and then (8) kinds of attainments called ***samāpatti*** are fulfilled in sequence through accomplishing preliminary work of that ***kasiņa***-object.  When  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  is  developed  through  performing  those attainments  called  ***samāpatti***  as  the  fundamental  factor  of  ***vipassanā***  practice,  the  Fruit- Knowledge of Arahant  is reached  consequently. All kinds of feelings during preliminary work called ***parikamma vedanā*** which arise while all kinds of practices, that preliminary work etc, are performing, are called ***kāmāvacara dhamma*** (***dhammas*** of the Sensual Sphere). Those kinds of feelings which associate with (8) kinds of attainments called ***Samāpatti*** are ***dhammas*** of the Fine material Sphere and Immaterial Sphere. Those kinds of feelings which associate with the Path-Knowledge and Fruit-Knowledge are the Supra-mundane ***dhamma***. Thus the seeing-consciousness which sees the ***kasiņa***-object is the relation of determinative dependence for arising of all kinds of feelings occurring in four kinds realms called sensual- fine material-immaterial-Supramundane. 

**PAGE-517** 

Therefore all kinds of feelings occurring in four kinds of realms (***catubhūmi-kavedanā***) are the  feeling  which  is  related  to  the  eye-contact  associating  with  the  seeing-consciousness which  sees  the  ***kasiņa***-object  previously.  Due  to  occurrence  of  feelings  which  arise depending  on  the  eye-contact  called  seeing  to  the  ***kasiņa***-object,  those  are  called ***cakkhusamphassa paccayā vedanā***. 

In this way, all kinds of consciousness occurring in four realms called ***catubhūmika citta*** are the worth getting by means of natural determinative dependence (***pakatūpanissaya***) which is shown previously. (***Abhi-A-2-36,37***)

2. ***samatikkama* (practicing for overcoming defilements)** 

When  the  visible-object  strikes  in  the  eye-door  \_\_\_\_\_  the  selfish-desire  arose  by taking desirable object in my continuum; the anger arose by taking undesirable object; the delusion arose due to inability to discern exactly the real nature of the ultimate ***dhamma*** of striking object; the conceit arose in the continuum of me who obsesses on the corporeality, feeling etc, as "self-identity"; the wrong-view arose in the continuum of me who ponders on the corporeality, feeling etc., as "self"; the unrest (***uddhacca***) arose in the continuum of me who wanders on the objects of corporeality, feeling etc.; the scepsis (***vicikicchā***) arose in the continuum of me who is unable to decide; the underlying tendency of defilement (***anusaya kilesa***) arose in the continuum of me who has got powerful defilements". 

In this way the virtuous gentleman who has got the knowledge which can distinguish on the arising of defilements, i.e., selfish desire, anger, delusion, conceit, wrong view, unrest, scepsis  etc.,  purifies  the  virtue  after  considering  in  away  that  “if  these  defilements  are proliferated  in  my  continuum,  it  will  be  disadvantageous  effect  and  destruction;  those defilements must be suppressed urgently”; and then he ponders in a way that if I am sleeping all the time, I am unable to suppress defilements; the strenuous effort should be developed previously  in  order  to  purify  virtue".  After  learning  the  way  of  practice  and  making preliminary  work  of  ***kasiņa***-object,  when  he  practices  ***vipassanā***  which  has  fundamental factor  of  attainments  called ***samāpatti***  he  reaches  in  to  the  Fruit-Knowledge  of  Arahant. During practicing in that way, those kinds of feelings occurring during preliminary work are sensual ***dhammas***. Those feelings associating with (8) kinds of absorptions and attainments (***jhānasamāpatti***) are fine material and immaterial ***dhammas***. Those feelings associating with the Path-Knowledge and Fruit-Knowledge are the Supra-mundane ***dhammas***. Thus due to occurrence  of  these  feelings  occurring  in  four  realms  after  overcoming  defilements  on visible-object, these feelings have  got designation as ***cakkhusamphassa paccayā vedanā***. Thus these kinds of consciousness occurring in four realms are worth getting by means of practicing for overcoming defilements (***samatikkama***). (***Abhi-A-2-37***) 

3. **Efficiency of practice \_\_\_\_\_** 

When the visible-object strikes in the eye-door a practicing ***meditator*** improves the knowledge which is able to distinguish in a way that "which base is dependence for arising of this visible-object?". Afterwards, due to understanding on that visible-object in a way that "this visible-object arises depending on the four great elements", both four kinds of great elements  and  derived  coporealities  are  kept  in  mind  as  "corporeal  ***dhammas***".  Those ***dhammas***,  seeing-consciousness  etc.,  which  take  the  object  of  that  corporeal  ***dhammas***, which arise by taking the object of that corporeal ***dhammas***, are kept in mind as "mental ***dhammas***".  Afterwards  corporeality-mentality  together  with  causal  ***dhammas***  are  kept  in mind and generalized as ***anicca, dukkha, anatta*** through the cascade processes of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, resulting in reaching in the Fruit-Knowledge successively. 

**PAGE-518** 

During practicing in that way, because these all kinds of feelings occurring in four realms  (***catubhūmika  vedanā***),  i.e.,  feelings  occurring  during  sensual  preliminary  work; feelings during attainments which are fine-material and immaterial sphere; feelings during the Path (-moment) and Fruit-(-moment) which are the Supra mundane ***dhammas***, are kinds of  feelings  which  arise  by  generalizing  on  three  characteristics  of  the  visible-object (conditioned  things  together  with  visible-object),  they  have  got  designation  as ***cakkhusamphasa paccayā vedanā***. Thus these all kinds of consciousness occurring in four realms are worth getting by means of practice. (***see in detail Abhi-A-36,38***) 
PAGE17
PAGE19 \* **NIBBĀNA GĀMINIPAŢIPADĀ** (Pa-Auk Tawya Sayadaw)

As shown in the eye-door, in the ear-door, mind-door, all kinds of feelings occurring in four realms have got designations as ***sotasamphasssa paccayā vedanā, manosamphassa paccayā vedanā*** by means of three situations, viz., ***upanissayakoti-samatikkama-bhāvanā***. In  the  nose-door,  tongue-door  and  body-door,  on  the  other  hand,  all  kinds  of  feelings occurring  in  four  realms  have  got  designation  as  ***ghānasamphasssa  paccayā  vedanā, jihvāsamphasssa paccayā vedanā, kāyasamphasssa paccayā vedanā*** respectively by means of two situations only, ***samatikkama*** and ***bhāvanā.*** (***Abhi-A-2-38,39***) 

In this case, it should be noticed specially on the fact the cause, the eye-contact, and the  result,  ***cakkhusamphassa  paccayā***  feelings  (=four  mental  aggregates  occurring  four realms)  are  separated  by  numerous  cognitive  process.  Therefore,  in  the  fifth  method  of discerning on dependent-origination, the eye-contact is also shown as a causal ***dhamma*** in the mind-door-cognitive  process  which  takes  only  visible-object  continuously.  It  should  be understood similarly on the ear-contact and ***sotasamphassa paccayā vedanā.*** 

**PAGE-519** 

10. ***vedanā paccayā taņhā*** 

**(due to arising of feeling, craving arises)** 

When the relation, due to this feeling, how the craving arise, is shown in detail, as the son is shown apparently by means of the name descended from father, such as ***seţţhiputta*** (= wealthy person’s son), ***brahma*** ***putta*** (=*brahama*’ son, etc., similarly – the Supreme Buddha preached on (6) kinds of craving, viz.,  

1. ***rūpataņhā*** = the sight craving 
1. ***saddataņhā*** = the sound craving 
1. ***gandhataņhā*** = the odour craving 
1. ***rasataņhā*** = the flavour craving 
1. ***phoţţhabbataņhā*** = the touch craving 
1. ***dhammataņhā*** = the craving for ideational object, 

by means of the name descended from the object in ***Pāli*** Text of ***Vibhańga*** (Analysis). 

Among those kinds of craving, each kind of craving varies into three kinds as ***kama taņhā***  (craving  for  sensual  pleasure),  ***bhavataņhā***  (craving  to  coming  into  existence), ***vibhavataņhā*** (craving to go out of existence) through the nature of occurrence. 

1. ***kāmataņhā\_\_\_\_\_*** When the visible-object strikes on the eye-clear-sensitivity (***cakkhu pasāda***), the sight craving, which arises pleasingly by means of great satisfying on the basis of sensuality called that visible-object, is called ***kāmataņhā*** (=sensual craving). 
1. ***bhavataņhā***\_\_\_\_\_ The sight craving which arises together with eternity wrong view (***sassatandiţţhi***) by which an obsession, “that visible-object is permanent; it exists eternally” arises, is called ***bhavataņhā*** (craving to coming into existence). It is right – The  passion  (***rāga***)  which  arises  together  with  eternity  wrong  view  is  worth designating as ***bhavataņhā***.  
1. ***vibhavataņhā***  –  The  sight  craving  which  arises  together  with  annihilation  view (***uccheda***-***diţţhi***) by which an obsession, “that visible-object annihilates after death”, arises, is called ***vibhavataņhā*** (craving to go out of existence). It is right- The passion (***rāga***)  which  arises  together  with  annihilation  view  is  worth  designating  as ***vibhavataņhā***. It should be understood similarly on sound craving etc. Thus there are 

(18) kinds of craving. 

2200 \* **NIBBĀNA GĀMINIPAŢIPADĀ** (Pa-Auk Tawya Sayadaw)

Because there are (18) kinds of craving for internal (6) kinds of object and (18) kinds of craving for external (6) kinds of object, there are (36) kinds of craving. These kinds of craving, in turn, vary for three periods, past, present and future, resulting in (108) kinds of craving in total. If those kinds are counted in brief, those are (6) kinds of craving, the sight craving etc., or those are (3) kinds of craving, viz., ***kāmataņhā***, ***bhavataņhā***, ***vibhavataņhā***. (***Abhi-A-2-170, 171, Vs-2-202)*** 

The  eternity  wrong  which  is  capable  of  obsessing  on  any  kind  of  objects,  either visible-object  or  audible-object  etc.,  as  the  self (***atta***)  and  that  “self  is  eternity,  is  called ***bhava***.  The  craving  which  arises  together  with  the  eternity  wrong  view  called  ***bhava***  is designated as ***bhavataņhā*** (craving to coming into existence). The annihilation view which is capable of obsessing on any kind of (6) objects as the “self” (***atta***) and that “self” annihilates after death, is called ***vibhava***. The craving which arises together 

**PAGE-520** 

with the annihilation view called ***vibhava*** is designated as ***vibhavataņhā*** (craving to go out of existence). 

1. **How the craving arises due to feeling** 

As  wet-nurse  is  given  a  large  amount  of  fees,  due  to  strong  attachment  on  son, similarly – these persons, 

1. the artist, sculptor who can make beautiful visible-object, 
1. the harper who can play well harp, 
1. aromatic substance producer, 
1. headcook who can cook tasteful food, 
1. weaver who can weave very fine cloth, 
1. pharmacist (druggist) who can prepare panacea which contains high nutritious food, who can give rise to occur various objects, visible-object etc., as wet nurse, are given a large amount of fees, due to strong attachment on the feeling which is produced by taking  objects,  visible-object  etc.,  which  is  similar  to  the  son,  through  great pleasingness  with  an  obsession  that  “my  feeling,  my  property”  etc..  It  should, therefore,  be  recognized  this  craving  arises  due  to  feeling.  ***(Abhi-A-2-171,  Vs-2- 202,203)*** 

***vedanā*** **(feeling)\_\_\_\_\_** The feeling which is the origin of craving is agreeable feeling with associates wit consequence consciousness. That consequence agreeable feeling benefits for arising  of  craving  by  means  of  efficiency  of  relation  of  determinative  dependence  only. ***(Abhi-A-2-171, Vs-2-203)*** 

**Relations of object and determinative dependence\_\_\_\_\_** 

The relation of object (***ārammaņa paccaya***) is only the object of present resultant ***dhamma***  (***paccayuppana)***  but  not  ability  to  arise  resultant  ***dhamma***,  as  the  relation  of determinative  dependence  which  has  ability  to  arise  resultant  ***dhamma***.  Therefore  the commentary  explained  it  benefits  by  means  of  efficiency  of  relation  of  determinative dependence only through causal ***dhamma***. In other words, due to saying as the relation of determinative  dependence,  the  relation  of  object-determinative  dependence ***(ārammaņupanissaya paccaya)*** is also confiscated. It should be recognized the commentator explained  the  occurrence  of  capable  of  benefiting  by  means  of  efficiency  of  relation  of determinative dependence only because the relation of object other than the relation of object determinative dependence has already been shown by saying as “the relation of determinative dependence only”. ***(Mūlaţī-2-120, Mahāţī-2-325, 326)*** 

2. **The next method\_\_\_\_\_ How all three kinds of feeling can be inferred** 

The person with disagreeable feeling usually has heartfelt desire on agreeable feeling. The  person  with  agreeable  feeling  usually  also  has  heartfelt  desire  on  more  and  more agreeable feeling. The neutrality feeling can also be said as agreeable one due to presence of calm occurrence. 

**PAGE-521** 

All the Supreme Buddhas, therefore, preached as ***vedanā paccaya taņhā*** (= due to arising of feeling, craving arises). All three kinds of feeling are causal ***dhammas*** of craving really. ***(Abhi-A-2-171, Vs-2-203)*** 

1. With  regarding  to  the  words,  ”the  person  with  disagreeable  feeling  usually  has heartfelt desire on agreeable feeling”, it shows how disagreeable feeling benefits the craving  which  desires  on  agreeable  feeling  by  means  of  efficiency  of  relation  of determinative dependence. 
1. With  regarding  to  the  words,  “the person  with  agreeable  feeling  usually  also  has heartfelt desire on more and more agreeable feeling”, it shows how agreeable feeling benefits the craving which desires more and more agreeable feeling than previous acquired feeling by means of efficiency of relation of determinative dependence. 
1. With regarding to the words, “the neutrality feeling can also be said as agreeable one, due to presence of calm occurrence”, it shows how neutrality feeling also benefits the craving which desires more and more agreeable feeling, as the agreeable feeling does, by means of efficiency of relation of determinative dependence. 
1. In this case, for the term neutrality feeling, those kinds of neutrality feeling which associate with wholesome consequence other than unwholesome consequence, and mundane  wholesome  and  unwholesome  consciousness  only  must  be  inferred  as agreeable feeling. Unwholesome consequence neutrality feeling, however, must be inferred as disagreeable feeling because it is undesirable feeling really. Therefore it can be said the fact the neutrality feeling which is inferred as disagreeable feeling and the neutrality feeling which is inferred agreeable feeling benefit the craving which desires  on  agreeable  feeling  by  means  of  efficiency  of  relation  of  determinative dependence, as disagreeable feeling and agreeable feeling do respectively***. (Mūlaţī-2- 120, 121, Mahāţī-2-326)*** 
1. All beings usually endeavour to perform ***kamma*** (action) by means of heartfelt desire to  resultant  ***dhammas***  produced  by  ***kamma***.  Therefore  consequence  feeling  only benefits the craving exceedingly by means of efficiency of relation of determinative dependence.  Generally  wholesome  and  unwholesome  feelings  do  not  benefit  the craving exceedingly by means of efficiency of relation of determinative dependence compared  wit  consequence  feeling  does.  It  should  be  recognized  at  benefits ordinarily. ***(Mūlaţī-2-120, Mahāţī-2-326, Anuti-2-132)*** 

2222 \* **NIBBĀNA GĀMINIPAŢIPADĀ** (Pa-Auk Tawya Sayadaw)

3. **In the continuum of only the person with underlying tendency *(anusaya dhatu)*** 

When the craving arises due to feeling the craving which can arise in three-time- phases called ***uppāda-ţhiti-bhańga***, which is called ***pariyutthanataņhā***, can be produced by feeling  in  the  continuum  of  only  the person  with  the  craving  which  is  embedded  in  the continuity  of  aggregates  as  underlying  tendency.  In  the  continuum  of  Arahant  who  has finished underlying tendency of craving, who has accomplished pure practice of path called ***maggabrahma*** ***cariya***, who has set adrift all unwholesome deeds, actually, the craving cannot arise  due  to  feeling.  Because  the  future  suffering  of  rounds  of  rebirth  is  absent  in  the continuum of the Arahant who lacks underlying tendency element, only the feeling, which arises  together  with  underlying  tendency  element  in  the  same  continuity  of  corporeality- mentality, is the causal ***dhamma*** of craving. It should be recognized the meaning through the efficiency in this way ***(Abhi-A-2-171, Vs-2-203)*** 

**PAGE-522** 

4. **To be noticed previously** 

In  the  commentary  of  ***Abhidhamma***  ***(Abhi-A-2-171)***  and  commentary  called ***Visuddhi*** ***magga*** ***(Vs-2-203)***, it is explained that only consequence feelings which associate with  fivefold  consciousness,  receiving,  investigating,  registering  consciousness  within various cognitive processes, eye-door-cognitive process etc., benefit craving exceedingly by the  efficiency  of  relation  of  determinative  dependence but  those  kinds  of  feelings  which associate with adverting, determining, impulsions benefit craving ordinarily by the efficiency of that relation. Because consequence feeling only is inferred significantly in the side of causal ***dhamma***, it should be noticed the causal ***dhamma***, feeling, and the resultant ***dhamma***, craving are separated by at least one mind moment or numerous mind moments or cognitive processes but not arise within the same mind moment. Generally the nature of relation of determinative  dependence  usually  occurs  in  different  cognitive  processes,  resulting  in separation  of  cognitive  process  between  the  causal  feeling  and  the  resultant  craving frequently. 

Therefore  according  to  the  words,  ***cakkhu  samphassaja  vedana***  (=  the  feeling produced by eye-contact) which lies in the side of causal ***dhamma***, those feelings which associate  with  each  mind  moment  within  eye-door-cognitive  process  and  those  feelings which associate with each mind moment within the follower mind-door-cognitive process, which  takes  the  visible-object,  must be  inferred  as  causal ***dhammas***  of  the  sight-craving accordingly. It should be recognized similarly on remaining feelings, the feeling produced by ear-contact (***sotasamphassaja vedana)*** etc. 

5. **Section of showing future cycle of rounds of rebirth** 

Depending on (6) kinds of feelings, (6) kinds of craving had been arisen enormous times in the continuum of practicing ***meditator*** throughout life. All those kinds of feeling, actually cannot be kept in mind thoroughly. 

According to explanation, ***idāni hetavo pañca, āyatim phala pañcakam,*** found in the commentary  ***(Abhi-A-2-182),***  ignorance-craving-clinging-formations-action  which  are cultivated  in  present  life  are  causal  ***dhammas***  of  consciousness-mind-matter-six  bases contact-feeling which will arise in future. Because this section shows how future cycle of rounds of rebirth occurs, it concerns with the plans which is cultivated for the purpose of attainment of any kind of future existences in the continuum of the practicing ***meditator***. Therefore the phenomenon how the craving which desires new future coming into-existence arises due to feeling must be discerned significantly. This craving together with clinging, ***kamma*** coming-into-existence (***kamma bhava***), which will be presented later, are inclusive in causal ***dhammas*** called ignorance-craving-clinging-formation-action which are cultivated for the purpose of attainment of any kind of future existences before attainment of ***nibbāna***. Therefore  (ignorance)  only  craving,  clinging,  (formations),  actions  (***kamma***)  which  are cultivated for the purpose of future existence must be discerned significantly. 

6. **Way of keeping in mind causal relationship PAGE-523** 
1. Due to arising of the feeling produced by eye-contact, the sight-craving arises. The feeling produced by eye-contact is causal ***dhamma***; the sight-craving is resultant ***dhamma***. 
1. Due to arising of the feeling produced by ear-contact, the sound-craving arises. The feeling produced by ear-contact is causal ***dhamma***; the sound-craving is resultant ***dhamma***. 
1. Due to arising of the feeling produced by nose-contact, the odour-craving arises. The  feeling  produced  by  nose-contact  is  causal  ***dhamma***;  the  odour-craving  is resultant ***dhamma***. 
1. Due to arising of the feeling produced by tongue-contact, the flavour-craving arises. The feeling produced by tongue-contact is causal ***dhamma***; the flavour-craving is resultant ***dhamma***. 
1. Due to arising of the feeling produced by body-contact, the touch-craving arises. The  feeling  produced  by  body-contact  is  causal  ***dhamma***;  the  touch-craving  is resultant ***dhamma***. 
1. Due to arising of the feeling produced by mind-contact, the ideational-craving arises. The feeling produced by mind-contact is causal ***dhamma***; the ideational-craving is resultant ***dhamma***. 

***dhammataņhā*  (ideational  craving)**\_\_\_\_\_  The  craving  which  has  heartfelt  desire  on consciousness,  mental  concomitants,  corporeal ***dhammas*** and various  objects of concepts (***paññatti***), other than five objects called visible, audible, olfactory, gustative, tactile objects, is called ***dhammataņhā*** (ideational-craving). 

7. ***Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta Sutta*** 

It  will  be  presented  on  the  way  of  discerning,  excerpt  from  ***Mahākaccāna bhaddekaratta*** ***Sutta***, for those persons who are unable to understand the way of discerning mentioned above. 

***Pāli Quotation (M-3-237)*** 

- “My eye-transparent-element may become in this way in future; my visible-objects 

may become in this way.” – Thus strong wish is performed in order to obtain un-acquired eye-transparent-element and visible-object. Due to performing strong wish, it can be said those future eye-transparent-element and visible-object are pleased whole-heartedly. If those 

2244 \* **NIBBĀNA GĀMINIPAŢIPADĀ** (Pa-Auk Tawya Sayadaw)

future eye-transparent-element and visible-object are pleased whole-heartedly, it can be said it is longing for the future. ***(M-3-237)*** 

All  (12)  bases  are  preached  in  similar  way.  The  Supreme  Buddha  also  preached similar way on five aggregates method in ***Bhaddekaratta*** ***Sutta*** ***(M-3-227).*** 

In accordance with these preachings, the craving which has heartfelt desire on future- aggregates, bases can arise by taking objects of future (5) aggregates, (12) bases. If this way of discerning is performed, it is quite easy to understand. 

Although  the  object  if  future  ***dhamma***,  the  craving  (ignorance-craving-clinging- formations-action) is present ***dhamma***. If the righteous person wishes for ***bhikkhu***’s life in future, the cravings which arise by taking objects of aggregates, bases occurring in ***bhikkhu***’s life can be discerned. 

**PAGE-524** 

If the righteous person wishes for preacher *deva*’s life in future, the cravings which arise by taking objects of (5) aggregates, (12) bases occurring in that preacher *deva*’s life can be discerned in this section. 

Unless this way of discerning is also far from understanding, discern by seeing the feeling and craving which usually arise in the continuity of corporeality-mentality of oneself with the help of insight knowledge. It is quite easy to understand by taking the object which usually gives rise to occur craving. 

For  instance\_\_\_\_\_  as  shown  in  explanation  found  in  the  commentary  called ***Sammohavinodanī***, any kind of ***kasiņa***-objects, the earth ***kasiņa***-object etc., must be taken as object. It is not difficult to develop concentration up to the fourth absorption by taking that ***kasiņa***-object for the righteous person who has fulfilled the concentration up to the fourth absorption through mindfulness of breathing. Then a wish for attainment of brahma’s life must be performed. Preliminary work (***parikamma***) of ***kasiņa***-object must be developed upto the fourth absorption successively. Causal and resultant ***dhammas*** must be kept in mind by seeing both phenomenon of arising of the feeling produced by eye-contact, due to seeing on ***kasiņa***-object  and  phenomenon  of  arising  of  the  sight-craving  which  desires  on  visible- objects occurring in the fine-material existence, due to that feeling produced by eye-contact. 

One  righteous  person  has  experienced  to  hear  that  if  absorptions  and  attainments (***jhānasamāpatti***) can be accomplished, fine-material existence can be obtained. With the help of that general knowledge one develops preliminary work of ***kasiņa***-object after seeing ***kasiņa***-object. He has heartfelt desire to attain fine-material brahma’s life. He has got fine material absorptions. Causal and resultant ***dhammas*** must be kept in mind by seeing how feeling, craving, clinging, action (***kamma*** coming-into-existence) arise depending on both ear-contact and eye-contact. 

**PAGE-525** 

11. ***taņhāpaccayā upādānam***  

Due to arising of craving, clinging arises 

The nature of capable of clinging strongly on any thing is called ***upādāna*** (clinging)***.*** There are  four  kinds  of  clinging,  viz.,  ***kāmupādāna***  (sensual  clinging),  ***diţţhupādāna***  (views clinging), ***sīlabbatupādāna*** (rule and rite clinging), ***attavādupādāna*** (self-belief clinging). 

1. ***kāmupādāna*** = The nature of capable of clinging strongly on sensual objects; 
1. ***diţţhupādāna***  =  The  nature  of  capable  of  clinging  strongly  on  wrong  views (***micchādiţţhi***): 
1. ***sīlabattupādāna*** = The nature of capable of clinging strongly on rules & rites, 
4. ***attavādu*** ***pādāna*** = The nature of capable of clinging strongly on self-belief. 

**2.11.1. Sensual clinging**\_\_\_\_\_ Fivefold sensual objects are called desirable ***vatthu kāma*** (bases of sensual desire). The craving which has heartfelt desire on those bases of sensual desire is called both ***kāmataņhā*** (sensual craving) and ***kilesa kāma*** (defilement of sensual desire).  The  succeeding  base  of  sensual  desire  which  is  reaching  into  the  steadfast  state through the efficiency of relation of determinative dependence of preceding base of sensual desire is called the sensual clinging (***kāmupādāna***). 

***taņhādahļattam  nāma  purimataņhāupanissaya  paccayena  dahļasambhūta  uttarataņhā eva. (Abhi-A-2-172, Vs-2-204)*** 

- only the succeeding craving which is reaching into the steadfast state through the efficiency of  relation  of  determinative  dependence  of  preceding  craving  is  called  ***taņhādahļatta*** (craving with steadfastness). It is also called the steadfast craving which is capable of firm clinging.  That  succeeding  steadfast  craving  only  is  designated  as  ***kāmupādāna***  (sensual clinging). 

In those two kinds of ***dhammas***, craving and clinging, the craving is the opposite of non-greediness  (***appicchatā***) because  it  is  the  nature  of  leading  towards  object  while  the clinging is the opposite of contentment (***santuţţhi***) because it is the nature of great desire through the occurrence of steadfast craving. 

Craving  is  source  of  suffering  of  striving  for  one’s  sustenance  called  ***pariyesana dukkha*** while clinging  is source of suffering of protecting for acquired sensuality  called ***ārakkhadukkha.*** The succeeding craving which is reaching into steadfast state of (108) kinds craving mentioned previously is called the sensual clinging ***(kāmupādāna). (Abhi-A-2-172, Vs-2-204)*** 

2. **Views clinging** \_\_\_\_\_ The succeeding wrong view which clings firmly to all wrong view together with those wrong views which reject ***kamma*** (action),consequence of ***kamma, natthika diţţhi, ahetuka diţţhi, akiriya diţţhi*** etc., other than rule and rite clinging, self-belief clinging,  is  called  ***diţţhupādāna***  (view  clinging).  Every  belief  which  rejects  ***kamma***, consequence of ***kamma*** is designated as ***diţţhupādāna***. 

**PAGE-526** 

***Sassato attā ca loko ca. (Dī-1-12)*** 

- Both the ‘self’ and world are eternal. The succeeding wrong view which clings 

firmly on preceding wrong view in that way is also ***diţţhupādāna. (Abhi-A-2-172, Vs-2-203)*** 

This example, “***sassato attā ca loko ca”***, shown by commentary is not intended to show as example of the views clinging but self-belief clinging which shows clinging on the “self”. It is only an example showing how succeeding wrong view clings firmly on preceding wrong  view  through  preaching  methodology  called  ***nidassananaya***  (the  method  showing well-known example). It should be recognized it is not example of views clinging. ***(Mūlaţī-2- 121)*** 

**The next method** \_\_\_\_\_ In two kinds of examples, ‘self’ and ‘world’, for above excerpt, “***sassato*** ***attā*** ***ca loko ca”,*** with regarding to the words, ***atta ca***, it shows the example of ***attavādupādāna***. According to the words, ***loko*** ***ca***, if the corporeality is inferred as the “self”, four kinds of mental aggregates can be inferred as ***loka*** (world), resulting in showing example of views clinging through “***sassato loko ca***”. It means succeeding wrong view clings firmly 

2266 \* **NIBBĀNA GĀMINIPAŢIPADĀ** (Pa-Auk Tawya Sayadaw)

in  a  way  that  preceding  wrong  view,  which  believes  four  mental  aggregates  as  ***loka***,  is eternal. It should be inferred the next method in this way. ( In this method if any one of aggregates is inferred as ‘self’, remaining four aggregates must be inferred as ‘world’ (***loka). (Mūlaţī-2-121)*** This is the method of inference which is not opposite to the commentary. 

3. **Rule & rite clinging** \_\_\_\_\_ The wrong view which is capable of considering wrongly in a way that “one can be purified from defilements, and one can be delivered from rounds of rebirth  through  some  ritual  habits,  such  as  cow’s  habit,  dog’s  habit  etc.,”  is  called ***sīlabbatupādāna*** (rule & rite clinging). 

Some worldling people who desire to emancipate from rounds of rebirth, without taking refuge in Noble Ones, the Supreme Buddha etc., consider in a way that “unwholesome deeds which had been done previously are present in the continuum of themselves; if those unwholesome deeds can be repaid to be owed in present life and new unwholesome deed is not done again, defilements could be purified and emancipation from rounds of rebirth can be accomplished”. Because of presence of consideration in that way some people practice cow’s habit strongly; some usually walk, eat, sleep as a cow without wearing any clothes; some usually walk, eat, sleep as a dog without wearing any clothes; they delight in cow’s habit, cow’s  practice;  they  delight  in  dog’s  habit,  dog’s  practice;  some  believe  that  joyful destination of heavenly being can be obtained through those practices. 

The person who fulfils dog’s practices completely will become dog after death and the person who fulfils cow’s practices completely will become cow after death certainly. In the ***Pāli*** Text, ***Kukkuravatika*** ***Sutta***, ***Majjhima*** ***Paņņāsa (M-2-50,51)*** There is a preaching that  if  the  wrong belief  that  “  I  will become  either  superior  heavenly  being  or  ordinary heavenly being through these habits, these ritual responsibility, these practices, these noble practices”… is present in continuum of oneself, he can reach any kind of two destinations called hell and animal realm accordingly, due to presence of that wrong belief.

4. **Self-belief clinging \_\_\_\_\_** 

The opinion which is capable of firm clinging on the wrong belief by which the “self” is uttered that “self” is present “ etc, is called ***attavādupāadāna*** (self-belief clinging). The basic meaning is a mental concomitant called ***diţţhi*** (wrong-view). Throughout this self-belief clinging  is  present  the  one  never  agree  with  non-self  condition  of  corporeal  and  mental ***dhammas*** but he usually says “only the self is present”. There are two kinds of “self” which are wrongly grasped by worldling persons, viz., 

1. ***parama*** atta = creator self and 
1. ***jīva atta*** = created self. 
1. ***parama atta*** \_\_\_\_\_ It is a self-belief which wrongly grasps the creator who can create the whole world together with beings is present really. 
1. ***jīva atta*** \_\_\_\_\_ It is a self-belief which wrongly grasps the created self is the vitality in the continuum of each being. 
1. **The self-belief on *parama atta*** \_\_\_\_\_ After destroying the old world and the new world  establishes  again,  when  three  realms  of  the  first  absorption  originates previously a great brahma who was dead from upper realm of brahma appeared in the realm of first absorption beforehand. During staying alone languidly and wishing for arising of another brahmas, due to finishing of efficacy of ***kamma***, others also appear in that realm of first absorption after dying from the upper ones. At that time the great brahma  who  appeared  in  the  realm  of  first  absorption  beforehand  thought  highly himself that new comer brahmas were created by himself because they arose as he wished. Those new comer brahmas also misunderstood that they were created by the great brahma because he has got much glowing complexion than themselves really and then they attended on him respectfully. 

After thinking highly on that great brahma in this way some brahmas reach into the human’s world due to finishing of efficacy of ***kamma***. That great brahma remains with three or two times longer life expectancy than others in the realm of the first absorption until some brahmas reach into human’s world as spontaneous born. When spontaneous born persons develop and attain absorptions in the human’s world, due to seeing on that great brahma again, they thought highly on him over and over, resulting in spreading of the wrong-belief that “this world together with all beings were created by the great brahma”.. at the beginning of protozoic era of the world. According to that opinion the great brahma is the great glorious and non-destructible self which can create the whole world. The self-opinion which firmly clings  on  that  creator  self  called  ***pramatta***  is  designated  as  ***attavādupādāna***  (self-belief clinging). (Please see detail in ***Brahmajāla*** ***Sutta***, ***Dīghanikāya.)*** 

2. ***jīva atta***\_\_\_\_\_ There is the “self” ***(atta),*** which is created by ***paramatta*** (creator self), which  is  known  as  “vitality  form,  butterfly  form,  consciousness  form,  self  form” inside this body. That “self” can be varied as five kinds, viz***, kāraka, vedaka,*** ***sāmī, nivāsī, sayamvasī.*** 

***kāraka*** \_\_\_\_\_ That self can do every work which is intended to be done. Al bodily gestures, walking, coming, flexing, stretching etc., are done by the ‘self’. Due to ability of self, every performance is accomplished as the self’s wish. 

**PAGE-528** 

Various kinds of wholesome and unwholesome deeds are performed by ability of that “self”. If the self desires to do wholesome deeds, bodily and verbally right deeds are accomplished according  to  the  self’s  order.  If  the  ‘self’  desires  to  do  unwholesome  deeds,  bodily  and verbally misdeeds are accomplished according to the self’s order. They believe in this way. 

***Vedaka***\_\_\_\_\_  The  consequence  of  wholesome  or  unwholesome  deeds  is  also  felt by  the ‘self’. One believes that the self will experiences good or bad consequences in future as it experiences every consequences with agreeable or disagreeable feeling in present. 

***sāmī***\_\_\_\_\_ It is a wrong belief that due to ability to govern in the authority concerned with the body, that “self” is the owner of body. 

***nivāsī*** \_\_\_\_\_ It is a wrong belief that the “self” is a permanent dweller in the body; due to ability to transfer and dwells to new body when the old one is destroyed, only the body is destroyed but not the self; it exists permanently. Some believe that if this vitality self called ***jīva atta*** can follow commandment of ***parama*** ***atta*** respectfully, when the body is destroyed it returns back to original creator, ***parama*** ***atta*** and joins together again because it is a part of ***parama*** ***atta***. It is similar to an opinion that “one is asleep in the noble bosom of the God”. ***sayamvasī***\_\_\_\_\_ It is a wrong belief that ‘self’ is capable of indulging concerning with the body  as  it’s  desire.  It  believes  that  every  function  of  realization  called  seeing,  hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, ideational realization which concerns with the body, is indulged by the ‘self’ as it’s desire. 

According to these two words, ***nivāsī***, ***sayamvasī***, those persons believe that the self is non-destructible  essence  with  the  nature  of  indulgence  (***vasavattana***)  as  it’s  desire.  Thus 

2288 \* **NIBBĀNA GĀMINIPAŢIPADĀ** (Pa-Auk Tawya Sayadaw)

those kinds of utterances concerning with the ‘self’ ***atta*** which is considered through the wrong view but not presence in the aspect of ultimate nature really is called the self-belief ***(atta vāda).*** The firm clinging on these two kinds of opinions, creator self opinion ***(parama atta  vāda)***  and  created  self  opinion  ***(jīva  atta  vāda)***  is  designated  as  self-belief  clinging ***(attavādupādāna).*** 

5. **Twenty kinds of self-identity views *(sakkāya diţţhi)*** 

During obsessing on the self-belief in this way, either all (5) kinds of aggregates or any one of (5) aggregates is obsessed as the “self”. An act of obsessing on (5) kinds of aggregates  in  this  way  is  called  ***sakkāya***  ***diţţhi***  (self-identity  view).  All  (5)  kinds  of aggregates which are present apparently in the aspect of ultimate nature are called ***sakkāya*** (self-identity), in accordance with explanation of words, ***santo*** ***kāyo*** ***sakkāyo***. The wrong view, which arises on those (5) aggregates called ***sakkāya***, is called ***sakkāya*** ***diţţhi*** (self- identity view). 

1. **Four kinds of self-identity view on the corporeal aggregate *(rūpakkhandha)*** 
1. ***rūpam attato samanupassati*** 

The corporeality is viewed through self (=as occurrence of self). ***“yam rūpam, so aham***. ***yo aham, tam rūpam*** = Corporeality and the ‘self’ are viewed as a single thing but not two kinds that “such corporeality is that myself; such myself is that corporeality”. 

**PAGE-529** 

For instance – during lighting of open oil lamp, it should be recognized it is similar to the view by which the tongue of flame and the light of flame are viewed as single thing but not different kinds in a way that “such tongue of flame is that light, such light of flame is that tongue of flame’. It is similar to the view visible-object is also ‘self’. 

2. ***rūpavantiva attāanam\_\_\_\_\_*** 

One views the self which has got corporeality. As a tree with shadow, one views that self has got corporeality over and over, due to obsession on mental ***dhamma*** as self. 

3. ***attani vā rūpam\_\_\_\_\_*** 

One views in a way that corporeality lies within the self. As the scent lies within the flower, the corporeality is viewed over and over in a way that it lies within the self, due to obsession on mental ***dhamma*** as self. 

4. ***rūpasamim vā attānam \_\_\_\_\_*** 

One views in a way that the self lies within the corporeality. As the ruby lies within casket, the self is viewed over and over in a way that it lies within the corporeality, due to obsession on mental ***dhamma*** as self. ***(Abhi-A-1-387, Mūlaţī-1-163)*** 

***(rūpam) etam mama*** = Corporeality is my property. – It is a kind of obsession by which corporeality and self are clung separately. 

***(rūpam) esohamasami*** = Corporeality is the self-identity. – It is a kind of obsession by which corporeality and self are clung as single thing. 

***(rūpam) eso me atta*** = Corporeality is my self-identity. – It is a kind of obsession by which corporeality and self are clung separately. 

These (4) kinds of similes mentioned above viz., 

1. ***vaņņa*** = light of open oil lamp (tongue and light of open oil lamp) 
1. ***rukkha*** = tree (tree and shadow) 
1. ***puppha*** = flower (flower and scent) 
1. ***maņi***  =  ruby  (ruby  and  casket),must  be  yoked  similarly  for  remaining  four  mental aggregates. ***(Abhi-A-1-387, 388)*** 

**Further explanation\_\_\_\_\_** 

**Earth-element  *(pathavīdhātu)  \_\_\_\_\_***Those  (6)  kinds  of  nature,  hardness,  softness, roughness,  smoothness,  heaviness,  lightness  are  the  earth-element.  That  nature  exists completely within the body. 

1. One usually utters that “I’m hard; I’m soft..” etc., through doing on that earth-element as  self-identity  sometimes.  It  is  a  kind  of  utterance  by  which  self-identity  and hardness are clung as a single thing. 
1. One  usually  utters  that  “I’ve  got  hardness,  softness,”  sometimes.  It  is  a  kind  of utterance by which hardness, softness and self-identity are clung as separate ones. 
1. One usually utters that “hardness, softness lies on my self-identity,” sometimes.  

**PAGE-530** 

4. One usually utters that “my self-identity lies on hardness, softness,” sometimes. 

The first obsession occurs through doing on hardness, softness as the self-identity. It believes the self-identity and hardness, softness are a single thing while the remaining three kinds occurs through making the self-identity and hardness, softness as separate ones 

It should be recognized similarly on both remaining (27) kinds of corporealities and external continuums, In the external continuum it is a kind of obsession that “he is hard, he is soft” etc. 

2. **Four kinds of self-identity views on the feeling aggregate *(vedanakkhandhā)*** 
1. ***vedanam attato samanupassati*** = Feeling is viewed through self (= as occurrence of self). 
1. ***Vedanāvantam vā attānam*** = One views the self which has got feeling. 
1. ***attani vā vedanam*** = One views in a way that feeling lies within the self. 
1. ***vedanāya vā attānam*** = One views in a way that the self lies within the feeling. Number (1) is a kind of belief by which self-identity and feeling are clung as a single 

thing, while remaining three view on corporeality-perception-formation-consciousness as the self and then the self and feeling are clung as separate ones. 

**Examples to be understood\_\_\_\_\_** 

1. I have good sight. ( a way of clinging on agreeable feeling) 
1. I have not good sight. (a way of clinging on disagreeable feeling) 
1. I have neither good nor bad sight but I see well. ( a way of clinging on neutrality feeling) 

3300 \* **NIBBĀNA GĀMINIPAŢIPADĀ** (Pa-Auk Tawya Sayadaw)

It should be understood similarly on all (6) kinds of objects. 

Feeling is the self-identity. (Feeling and self are clung as a single thing.) 

Feeling is my property: my feeling is good; my feeling is suffering; my feeling is comfortable. (Feeling and self are clung as separate ones.) 

3. **Four kinds of self-identity views on the perception aggregate *(sannakkhandha)*** 
1. ***saññam attato samanupassati*** = Perception is viewed through self (= as occurrence of self). 
1. ***saññāvantam vā attānam*** = One views the self which has got perception. 
1. ***attani vā saññam*** = One views in a way that perception lies within the self. 
1. ***saññāya vā attānam*** = One views in a way that the self lies within the perception. 

**PAGE-531** 

Number (1) is a kind of belief by which self-identity and perception are clung as a single thing while remaining three view on corporeality-feeling-formation-consciousness as the self and then the self and perception are clung as separate ones. 

**Examples to be understood \_\_\_\_\_** 

Perception is the self-identity; I can perceive; I memorize. (It is a kind of clinging shown in number 1.) 

Perception is my property. (Perception and the self are clung as separate ones.) 

***rūpa  saññā*  (perception  on  visible-object)**  –  When  various  things  are  seen,  the  wrong realization which arises in a way that “I memorize this person; I recognize this case “ etc., is the wrong view ***(diţţhi)*** which arises depending on perception of visible-object. It should be recognized similarly on perception of audible-object etc. 

4. **Four kinds of self-identity views on the formation aggregate *(sańkhārakkhandhā)*** 
1. ***sańkhāre  attato  samānupassati***  =  Formations  are  viewed  through  self  (=  as occurrence of self). 
1. ***sańkhāravantam vā attānam*** = One views the self which has got formations. 
1. ***attani vā sańkhāre*** = One views in a way that formations lie within the self. 
1. ***sańkhāresu vā attānam*** = One views in a way that the self lies within formations. Number (1) is a kind of belief by which self-identity and formations are clung as a 

single thing while remaining three view on corporeality-feeling-perception-consciousness as the self and then the self and formations are clung as separate ones. 

**Examples to be understood \_\_\_\_\_** 

Formations are the self-identity. (Formations and the self are clung as a single thing.) 

Formations are my properties. (Formations and the self are clung as separate ones.) 

During endeavouring to see various visible-objects, it is the wrong view which arises depending on volition of the visible-object ***(rūpasañcetanā),*** such as “I go to see; I come to see; I improve to see” etc. It should be recognized similarly on volition of the audible-object ***(saddasañcetanā)*** etc. 

I am lucky; I have goodwill; my benevolence is different from other’s. (It is the wrong view which arises depending on the volition.) 

I have good concentration; I concentrate well; I have not good concentration; I can not concentrate  well.  [(It  is  the  wrong  view  which  arises  depending  on  the  one-pointedness ***(ekaggatā).]*** 

I think miscellaneous things. (It is the wrong view which arises depending on the initial application called ***vitakka.)*** 

I think over and over. (It is the wrong view which arises depending on the sustained application called ***vicāra.)*** 

I endeavour various functions. (It is the wrong view which arises depending on the effort called ***viriya***.)

**PAGE-532** 

I want to get various things; I want to go; I want to make; I want to reach; I want to say; I want to see various things. (It is the wrong view which arises depending on intention called ***chanda***).

I can not surrender; I can not give in him; I can not be humble; I will win over. (It is the wrong view which arises depending on conceit called ***māna***.) 

I have got wrong view; only my belief is right; Only my self-belief is right; 

Only my eternity view is right; Only my annihilation view is right etc., In this way, any obsession on wrong view is the self-identity view which clings to wrong view called (***diţţhi***.)
