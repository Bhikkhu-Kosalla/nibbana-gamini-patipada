**INTRODUCTION** 

**Bearing in mind profoundity of the *Dhamma* by the Supreme Buddha** 

After attaining Enlightenment, at the morning of one of Thursdays, 6th waxing of the moon, **Wazo**, fourth month of the year,103 Great Era, the Supreme Buddha stood at the base of medium-sized tree bearing fruit with almond-like kernels, **Buchanania Latifolia**, and then approached and sat at the base of banyan tree called ***ajapālanigyodha***. At that time in the continuum of the Supreme Buddha who stayed in seclusion, this way of reasoning appeared as follows. \_\_\_\_\_ 

***Pali Quotation (Vi-3-5, Dī-2-31)*** 

“These  ***Dhammas***  of  Four  Noble  Truths  which  have  been  known  and  seen penetratively by the Perfectly 

Self-Enlightenment of myself are very profound as the mass of water under that lift the mass of global earth. These are very difficult to see as mustard seed covered by Mount Meru, resulting in inability to see easily. These are very difficult to be understood as tips of tail hair divided by (100) times are very difficult to be touched each other, resulting in inability to know penetratively through easy way of practice. 

These Supramundane ***Dhammas*** which have been known and seen penetratively by myself are full of very peaceful and noble qualities. 

These Noble ***Dhammas*** called Four Noble Truths are not worth concentrating by only initial  application  of  philosophers  with  reasoning  but  not  practice.  These  are  worth concentrating by right view experiential knowledge only. The Noble Eightfold Path called the right course leading to ***nibbāna*** (***sammāpaţipadā***) is worth knowing and seeing by wise and righteous persons with practical knowledge. 

These all beings are taking delight in two kinds of heartfelt desire i.e., heartfelt desire on five kinds of sensuality called ***kāmālaya*** and heartfelt desire to enjoy those five kinds of sensuality called ***taņhālaya***. 

**PAGE-B** 

Those all beings are fond of those two kinds of heartfelt desire really, resulting in difficulty to understand on this principle of dependent-origination with incessant phenomena of arising and passing away of causal and resultant ***dhammas***. 

The  king  who  enters  into  the  royal  garden,  which  is  well  cultivated  by  clever gardener, where various kinds of ornamental plants are fully grown and luxuriant enjoys and takes delight in the royal garden but never displease to stay there. 

Similarly these all beings enjoy and take delight in the garden of suffering of rounds of rebirth with both kinds of heartfelt desire on sensuality and heartfelt desire to enjoy those sensuality. 

They live happily in cycle of rounds of rebirth without feeling bored any more. Those all  beings  are  very  difficult  to  see  this  principle  of  dependent-origination  with  incessant phenomena of arising and passing away of causal and resultant ***dhammas***. 

The Supreme Noble ***dhamma*** called ***nibbāna***, which is absolute cessation of all kinds of conditioned things; which is void of four kinds of ***upadhi*** called ***kāmupahi*** (sensuality ground),  ***khandhupadhi***  (aggregate  ground),  ***kilesupadhi***  (defilement  ground),  ***abhi sańkhārupadhi*** (formation ground); which is finished of (108) varieties of craving; which is void of (1500) kinds of defilements; which is absolute cessation of all kinds of suffering is the most difficult ***dhammas*** to be understood really. 

As if I preach those profound ***dhammas***, those heavenly beings, human beings and brahmas with immatured controlling faculties, who are not deserving to enlighten by my preaching, resulting in weariness for me really.” 

This way of reasoing arose in the continuum of the Supreme Buddha. Furthermore these two verses which are very wonderful but not experienced to hear arose apparently in the insight of the Supreme Buddha. 

***kicchena  me  adhigatam,  halam  dāni  pakāsitum.  rāgadosaparetehi,  nāyam  dhammo susambudho.*** 

***paţisotagāmim nipuņam, gambhīram duddasam aņum.*** 

***rāgarattā na dakkhanti, tamokkhan dhena āvuţā. (Vi-3-5,6; Dī-2-31)*** 

**PAGE-C** 

***imam dhammam*** = These ***dhammas*** called Four Noble Truths, 

***adhigatam*** = which has been known and seen 

***kicchena***  =  through  fulfilling  three  kinds  of  perfections  and  practices,  five  kinds  of abandonment 

***me*** = of myself 

***halam*** = is not suitable 

***pakāsitum*** = to be expounded apparently for human and heavenly beings and brahmas 

***dāni*** = at recent time. 

***ayam dhammo*** = The essence of these Four Noble Truths 

***na susambudho*** = is not easily enlightened 

***rāgadosaparetehi*** = for those persons who are oppressed by lust and anger awfully. 

***tamokhandhena*** = Due to cloud of darkness called ignorance 

***āvuţā*** = conceals not to see by eye of wisdom, 

***rāgaratta*** = those beings with lustfulness on sensuality, existence, wrong view ***na dakkhanti*** = can not see 

***paţisota  gāmim***  =  Four  Noble  Truths  ***dhammas***  which  leads  to  ***nibbāna***  called  way  of upstream entering into rounds of rebirth, 

***nipuņam*** = which is very subtle, 

***gambhīram*** = very profound 

***aņum*** = very fine, 

***duddasam*** = which is very difficult to be seen as mustard seed covered by Mount Meru. (***Vi- 3-5,6; Dī-2-31***) 

Four Noble Truths preached by the Supreme Buddha is very difficult and profound in this  way.  Principle  of  Dependent-Origination  also  includes  among  those  difficult  and profound Four Noble Truths. 

As the Supreme Buddha preached that as if Four Noble Truths are not known and seen penetratively by right view knowledge of one self, suffering of rounds of rebirth can not be terminated, 

in ***Kūţāgāra Sutta, Sacca Samyutta,*** similarly, in ***Mahānidāna Sutta (Dī-2-47)***, the Buddha preached  that  as  if  the  principle  of  dependent-origination  is  not  known  and  seen  by ***anubodhañāņa*** (repeated practical knowledge) and ***paţivedha ñāņa*** (realizable knowledge) of oneself, one can not escape from suffering of rounds of rebirth. 

Therefore  even  though  it  is  very  difficult  and  profound  to  be  understood  every righteous person who wants to emancipate rounds of rebirth has to endeavour in order to know and see penetratively on principle of dependent-origination. 

During endeavouring in that way the righteous person has to follow respectfully on the way of practice called (7) kinds of cascade of purification. 

1. ***Sīla visuddhi*** = Try to purify moral conducts thoroughly. 
1. ***Cittavisuddhi*** = Try to purify consciousness through attaining any kind of concentration, access concentration  or full concentration which canremove impurities of hindrances (***nīvaraņa***) 
1. ***Diţţhivisuddhi*** = Try to attain clear understanding on corporeality-mentality (= try to attain the knowledge of Analysing Mentality-Corporeality). 
1. Afterwards  one  should  transfer  to  the  stage  of  Purification  by  Overcoming  Doubt (***kankhāvitaraņavisuddhi***). 

Unless  three  kinds  of  cascades  of  purification  called  ***Sīlavisuddhi,  Cittavisuddhi, Diţţhivisuddhi*** are accomplished, one should not perform in order to attain the knowledge of Cause and Condition which is capable of keeping in mind causal ***dhmmas*** of three periods, past, future and present. It is very difficult to succeed because purification by overcoming doubt called the knowledge of cause and Condition can not be attained with skipping. 

**PAGE-D** 

Furthermore, only when four-edged dagger called knowledge which is sharpened on the whetstone called concentration after standing on the ground called thoroughly purified virtue, can penetrate until field of ultimate nature of corporeal and mental ***dhammas*** the way of cycle of rounds of rebirth called principle of dependent-origination can be known and seen by penetrative experiential knowledge really. (***Abhi-A-2-189, Vi-2-221***) 

May  all  righteous  persons  who  have  heartfelt  desire  to  attain  true  ***dhamma***  be successful to know and see penetratively on principle of dependent-origination by the right view knowledge of themselves.
