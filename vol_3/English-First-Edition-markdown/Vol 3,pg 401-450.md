**(1) *nānākkhaņika kamma* (asynchronous action)** — As previous learning of technology benefits  asynchronously  later  learning  of  technology,  the  volition  called  ***kamma***  never benefits at the moment of existing of itself, but benefits later asynchronously. Therefore, the volition which had been occurred asynchronously to the occurrence of resultant ***dhamma*** within three time-phases, i.e., ***uppāda**, **ṭhiti**, **bhańga**,* is called "the volition of asynchronous action" *(**nānākkhaņika** **kamma** **cetanā**).* Although that kind of volition had been occurred previously last billion worlds time *(**kappas**),* it is able to benefit by means of relation of asynchronous  action,  which  is  capable  of  occurring  resultant  ***dhamma**.*  It  is  right.\_\_\_\_ Although  wholesome  and  unwholesome  actions  benefit  resultant  mental  aggregates  and corporealities produced by ***kamma*** (CPK) by means of relation of asynchronous action, it is unable to benefit at the moment of existing of itself (= within three time-phases). If it is so a man performs an wholesome deed which is capable of reaching into heavenly being existence with the result that he will be born as heavenly being at the time of making that action due to efficiency of that wholesome deed. 

Nevertheless — The action has done at such moment. Just after that moment, that volition, which is also impermanent ***dhamma*** only, passes away in accordance with natural fixed law of conditioned ultimate ***dhamma** (**sańkhata paramattha dhamma**).* Either volition of wholesome impulsion or volition of unwholesome impulsion, dissimilar to consequence ***dhammas**  (**vipāka**  **dhamma**),*  never  passes  away  without  any  remain  but  significant potentiality of ***kamma*** has been buried in the continuum of corporeality and mentality and passes away. Although those volition of wholesome deeds or unwholesome deeds are absent in three-time-phases, ***uppāda**, **ṭhiti**, **bhańga**,* if those remaining causal ***dhammas*** called 'time- state of life-substratum-undertaking' *(**kāla-gati-upadhi-payoga**)* are put together, the resultant ***dhammas*** can be occurred in ... 

1. present life for ***diṭṭha*** ***dhamma vedanīya kamma***, 
1. second life adjacent to present life __for *upapajja vedanīya*__ __*kamma*__ 
1. any kind of future lives which is deserving to reach, except present and second lives for ***aparāpariya vedanīya** **kamma**,* because the action *(**kamma**)* had been done actually. 

Therefore, the relation which can give rise to resultant ***dhammas*** asynchronously; which had been occurred in different previous moments, is designated  as the relation of asynchronous action *(**nānākkhaņika** **kamma** **paccaya**). **(Abhi-A-3-374; Mūlaṭī-3-172)*** 

(21) kinds of volition of wholesome deeds and (12) kinds of volition of unwholesome deeds which had been occurred in previous moments asynchronously are causal ***dhammas**.* Consequent mental aggregates *(**vipāka** **nāmakkhandhā**)* and CPK called ***katattā rūpa*** are resultant ***dhammas**.* 

Causal  ***dhammas***  are  past  ***dhammas***  but  resultant 

***dhammas*** are present ones.

(2) ***sahajāta kamma* (compatible action) —** 
Translated by - ***Aññatara Bhikkhu*** \*  PAGE44

Those  kinds  of  volition  associating  with  all  (89)  kinds  of  consciousness  benefit associating mental ***dhammas*** with itself; CPM for along with the life except the moment of process of NONE *(**paṭisandhi**),* and CPK. of process of NONE, by means of the relation of compatible action *(**sahajāta** **kamma** **paccaya**).* It is right. — Among those kinds of volition of  wholesome  deeds  or  unwholesome  deeds,  any  kind  of  unretentive  volition  benefits remaining ***dhammas*** by means of occurrence of significant action called ***citta payoga.*** It should,  therefore,  be  designated  as  the  relation  of  compatible  action  *(**sahajāta**  **kamma** **paccaya**).* *(*Bodily expression *(**kāya** **viññatti**)* is called ***kāya** **payoga*** while verbal expression ***(vacī viññatti)*** is ***vacī payoga,*** the volition ***(cetanā), citta payoga. (Abhi-A-3-374,375)*** 

In this relation, causal ***dhammas*** are various kinds of volition associating with (89) kinds  of  consciousness  while  the  resultant  ***dhammas***  are  (89)  kinds  of  consciousness; associating aggregates called 51 kinds of mental concomitants excluding volition; CPM and CPK of process of NONE. In this relation both causal and resultant ***dhammas*** are present ***dhammas**.* 

2. ***sahajāta kamma* and *nānākkhaņika kamma*** 

Those kinds of volition of wholesome deeds and unwholesome deeds can be called two names, compatible action *(**sahajāta** **kamma**)* and asynchronous action *(**nānākkhaņika** **kamma**)* according to time. 

1. Compatible  wholesome  volition  of  sensuous  sphere  which  belongs  to  charity,  virtue, meditation  practice  *(**dāna-sīla-bhavanā**)*  benefits  associating  wholesome  ***dhammas***  with itself  and  CPM  in  realm  of  five-groups-existence,  and  it benefits  associating  wholesome ***dhammas*** in realm of four-groups-existence *(**catuvokāra bhūmi**),* within three-time-phases, by means **of relation of compatible action *(sahajāta kamma paccaya).*** 

Those kinds of wholesome volition of sensuous sphere *(**dāna**-**sīla**-**bhāvanā**)* which had  been  passed  away  benefits  consequent  aggregates  of  sensuous  sphere  *(**kāmāvacāra** **vipāka khańdhā**),* it means aggregates of process of NONE, life-continuum, death, fivefold consciousness, receiving, investigating, registering which are consequent ones *(**vipāka**)* and CPK by means of **relation of asynchronous action *(nānākkhaņika kamma)*** in realm of five-groups-existence only but not in other  realms. (It benefits the occurrence of seeing- consciousness,  hearing-consciousness,  receiving,  investigating  which  are  consequent aggregates in realm of fine-material sphere.) ***(Abhi-A-3-375)*** 

2. Compatible  wholesome  volition  of  fine-material  sphere  benefits  certainly  associating ***dhammas*** with itself and CPM by means of the **relation of compatible action.** 

When it had passed away, furthermore, that volition benefits consequent aggregates of fine-material sphere and CPK by means of the **relation of asynchronous action.** ***(Abhi-A-3- 375)*** 

3. Compatible  wholesome  volition  associating  with  immaterial  wholesome  deed,  and compatible wholesome volition associating with wholesome deed, of the supra-mundane Path benefit  associating ***dhammas***  with itself  and  CPM  in  the  realm  of  five-groups-existence; those kinds of volition are benefittable for associating mental aggregates with itself in the realm of four-groups-existence. 

**PAGE-403** 

When they had been passed away, those kinds of wholesome volition of immaterial sphere  and  supra-mundane  Path  benefit  respective  consequent  mental  aggregates  *(**vipāka nāmakkhańdha**)* by means of the **relation of asynchronous action *(nānākkhaņika kamma*** 
PAGE3

***paccaya).***  Wholesome  volition  of  immaterial  sphere  gives  rise  to  consequent  mental aggregates  of  immaterial  sphere  for  coming  existence.  Supra-mundane  wholesome  Path, however,  gives  rise  to  consequent ***dhammas***  called Noble  Fruit-Knowledge  *(**ariya phala ñāņa**)*  contiguously.  Due  to  occurrence  of  asynchronous  mind  moments,  i.e.,  volition  of wholesome Path occurs previously and consequent ***dhamma*** called Noble Fruit occurs later, resulting in designating as __asynchronous action *(nānākkhaņika kamma).*__ __*(Abhi-A-3-375)*__ 

4. Compatible unwholesome volition benefits associating mental aggregates with itself and CPM in the realm of five-groups-existence and it benefits associating mental aggregates only in  the  realm  of  four-groups-existence  by  means  of  the  **relation  of  compatible  action *(sahajāta kamma paccaya).*** 

When it had passed away, furthermore, it benefits unwholesome consequent mental aggregates  *(**a-kusala  vipāka  namakkhańdhā)***  and  CPK  by  means  of  the  **relation  of asynchronous action *(nānākkhaņika kamma paccaya). (Abhi-A-3-375)*** 

[**Notes:** — According to these explanations of commentary, it should be recognized the  fact  that  by  the  time  they  are  obviously  present  in  three-time-phases,  ***uppāda-ṭhiti- bhańga,*** wholesome volition and unwholesome volition benefit associating mental aggregates within one mind-moment and CPM which are arising simultaneously with itself by means of the relation of compatible action and furthermore when they had passed away they benefit resultant ***dhammas** (=* consequent mental aggregates and CPK) by means of the relation of asynchronous action. With referring to that asynchronous action, it has been presented in previous section of discerning of causal relationship that — due to occurrence of  action *(**kamma**),* (CPK) ***rūpakkhańdhā*** arises; the action is causal ***dhamma**,* (CPK) ***rūpakkhańdhā*** is resultant ***dhamma**,* etc.] 

3. ***vipāka cetanā-kiriya cetanā* (consequent volition-indifferent volition)** 
5. Various kinds of consequent volition *(**vipāka cetanā**)* of sensuous sphere and fine-material sphere benefit associating (consequent) ***dhammas*** with itself and CPM for during life *(**pavatti** **kāla**),* CPK at the moment of process of NONE by means **of relation of compatible action.** 
5. Consequent volition of immaterial sphere benefits associating (consequent) ***dhammas*** with itself by the **relation of compatible action.** 
5. Supra-mundane consequent volition (= the volition of Noble Fruit) benefits associating ***dhammas*** and CPM for during life in the realm of five-groups-existence, and it benefits mental  ***dhamma***  only  in  the  realm  of  four-groups-existence  by  means  **of  relation  of compatible action.** ***(Abhi-A-3-375)*** 

**PAGE-404** 

8. Those kinds of indifferent volition of sensuous sphere, fine-material sphere and immaterial sphere  which  are  occurring  in  three  realms  called ***kāma  rūpa**  **arūpa**,* benefit  associating ***dhammas*** with itself and CPM in the realm of sensuous sphere by means of **relation of compatible  action.**  Those  kinds  of  indifferent  volition  of  sensuous  sphere,  fine-material sphere  and  immaterial  sphere  benefit  associating  mental  ***dhamma***  only  in  the  realm  of immaterial sphere by means **of relation of compatible action.** ***(Abhi-A-3-375,376)*** 

It is a kind of relation in which mentality benefits mentality and corporeality. 

14. ***vipāka paccaya* (the relation of *kamma* consequence)** 

Translated by - ***Aññatara Bhikkhu*** \*  PAGE66

Those consequent ***dhammas*** (= four consequent mental aggregates) which are capable of  benefiting  in  order  to  occur  quiescence  without  undertaking  by  means  of  quiescent occurrence, are the relation of ***kamma*** consequence _(**vipāka paccaya**). **(Abhi-A**_ **-3-349)** 

1. **Explanation** 

***ussāhoti  ca  kiriyamayacittuppādassa  pavattiākāro  veditabbo,  yo  bhāpāroti  ca vuccati, na vīriyussāho. (Anuṭī-3-232)*** 

A  kind  of  state  of  consciousness  *(**cittuppāda**)*  which  is  capable  of  occurring  and finishing bodily and verbally expressions is called endeavour *(**ussāha**).* That state of affair is also called service *(**vyāpāra**).* It is not effort *(**yīriya**).* Those services by which actions relating to body and speech of ***dhammas**,* wholesome deed, unwholesome deed etc, can be occurred, are  called  endeavour  *(**ussāha**).*  Wholesome  impulsion  and  unwholesome  impulsion  are unable  to  be  quiescent  due  to  presence  of  service  *(**vyāpāra**)*  in  order  to  occurrence  of consequence. 

Consequent indifferent consciousness *(**vipāka kiriya citta**),* however, are able to be quiescent at the moment of arising of themselves due to lack of service in order to give rise to consequence. 

**Indifferent impulsion *(kiriya javana)\_\_\_\_\_*** 

Those different impulsions can be occurred in the continuum of Arahants who are lacking  underlying  tendency  *(**anusaya**).*  In  the  continuum  of  those  Arahants  indifferent impulsions have quiescent nature due to lack of service with great endeavour in order to occur  consequence  *(**vipāka**).*  They  are  always  lacking  service  in  order  to  occurrence  of consequence. 

**Consequence *dhammas (vipāka dhammd) —*** 

Those kinds of consequent consciousness are not state of consciousness consisting of performance *(**kiriyāmaya cittuppāda**),* which are capable of occurring bodily action, verbally action called bodily expression *(**kāya** **viññatti**)* verbally expression *(**vacī viññatti**).* Therefore they  are  lacking  endeavour  in  order  to  occurrence  of  any  kind  of  consequence.  Due  to absence of service for the occurrence of consequence they are also quiescent. Consequent consciousness, therefore, are designated as quiescent nature without endeavour *(**nirussāha santabhāva**).* Therefore the commentary explained as follows:\_\_\_\_\_ 

***nirussāhasantabhāvena  nirussāhasantabhāvāya  upakārako  vipākadhammo vipākapaccayo. (Abhi-A-3-*349)** 

**PAGE-405** 

Those  consequent  ***dhammas***  which  are  capable  of  benefiting  in  order  to  occur quiescent without undertaking by means of quiescent occurrence are the **relation of *kamma* consequence *(vipāka paccaya). (Abhi-A-3-349)*** 

2. **Summary** 
1. Wholesome deed and unwholesome deed are non-quiescent nature with undertaking service due to occurrence with service which is capable of performing bodily action 
PAGE5

and verbally action (called ***kāya** **payoga** **vacī** **payoga**)* and due to presence of service which is capable of giving rise to consequence *(**vipāka**).* 

2. Although  service  which  is  capable  of  performing  bodily  and  verbally  actions, indifferent impulsions *(**kiriya javana**)* **are** quiescent nature, due to absence of service which is capable of giving **rise to** consequence. 
2. Due to not only incapability to occur bodily and verbally actions but also absence of service which is capable of  giving rise to consequence, consequent ***dhammas*** are quiescent nature indeed. 

Those causal ***dhammas*** benefit CPM during life *(**pavatti**),* CPK at the moment of process of NONE *(**paṭisandhi**);* and associating ***dhammas*** during life and moment of process of NONE by means of the relation of ***kamma*** consequence *(**vipāka** **paccaya**). **(Abhi-A-3- 349,350)*** 

1. During life — (1) kind of consequent indifferent mental aggregate *(**vipāka** **avyākata nāmakkhańdhā**)* benefits (3) kinds of consequent indifferent mental aggregates and CPM, 
1. (2) kinds of consequent indifferent mental aggregates benefit (2) kinds of consequent indifferent mental aggregates and CPM, 
1. (3) kinds of consequent indifferent mental aggregates benefit (1) kind of consequent indifferent  mental  aggregate  and  CPM  by  means  of  the  relation  of  ***kamma*** consequence *(**vipāka** **paccaya**).* 
1. At the moment of process of NONE — (1) kind of consequent indifferent mental aggregate benefits (3) kinds of consequent indifferent mental aggregates and CPK *(**katattā rūpa**),* 
1. (2) kinds of consequent indifferent mental aggregates benefit (2) kinds of consequent indifferent mental aggregates and CPK, 
1. (3) kinds of consequent indifferent mental aggregates benefit (1) kind of consequent indifferent  mental  aggregate  and  CPK  by  means  of  the  relation  of  ***kamma*** consequence. 
1. Mental aggregates of process of NONE of five-groups-existence benefit heart-base *(**hadaya** **vatthu**)* by means of the relation of ***kamma*** consequence. *(**Abhi-A-3-350**)* 

In this relation both causal and resultant ***dhammas*** are present ***dhammas*** existing in three-time-phases, ***uppāda**-**ṭhiti**-**bhańga*** called ***khaņattaya samangī**.* 

This is a kind of relation in which mentality benefits mentality and corporeality.

Four kinds of nutriments, which are capable of benefiting to corporeal and mental ***dhammas*** by means of occurrence of supporting, are called the **relation of nutriment *(ahara paccaya). (Abhi-A-3-350)***

1. Those,  nutriments  produced  by  ***kamma**,*  mind,  temperature,  nutriment,  which  are deserving to be edible food "made into palmful ball" although they are not really food palmful ball (= called ***kabaļīkāra āhāra ojā**)* benefit corporealities produced by four causes  *(**catujakāya**),*  corporealities  produced  by  three  causes  *(**tijakāya**)*  which  are occurring within different and same corporeal units excluding nutriment occurring same corporeal unit by  means of the relation of corporeal nutriment *(**rūpa** **āhāra** **paccaya**)*. 
1. Those  mental  nutriments  called  contact-volition-consciousness  *(**phassa**-**cetanā**- **viññāņa**)* benefit associating mental ***dhammas*** and CPK at the moment of process of NONE, CPM during life, which are caused by those mental nutriment, by means of the relation of mental nutriment *(**arūpa** **āhāra** **paccaya**).* (***Paṭṭhāna-l-7***) 
1. At  the  moment  of  process  of  NONE,  mental  nutriments  called  contact-volition- consciousness, which are consequent indifferent ones, benefit both associating mental aggregates and CPK *(**katattā** **rūpa**)* by  means  of the relation of  mental nutriment *(**arūpa āhāra paccaya).*** (***Paṭṭhāna-*1-156**) 
1. ***kabaļīkāra āhāra*** 

***kabaļīkāro āhāroti catusantatisamuṭṭhāne rūpe ojā āhāro nāma. so pana yasmā kabaļam karitvā ajjhoharitova āhārakiccam karoti, na bahi ṭhito, tasmā āhāroti avatvā "kabaļīkāro āhāro” ti vuttam. kabaļam karitvā ajjhoharitabbavatthukattā vā kabaļīkāroti nāmametam tassa. (Abhi-A-3-377)*** 

Although it is said on ***kabaļīkāra āhāra*** only it must not be interpreted on nutriment produced by temperature *(**utuja ojā**)* only, which is occurring in external and is worth eating, but on all kinds of nutriments produced by four causes *(**catu samuṭṭhānika ojā**).* Nutriments produced by four causes, which are consisting in four kinds of corporeal continuities, called continuity  of  CPK,  continuity  of  CPM,  continuity  of  CPT  (corporeality  produced  by temperature) and continuity of CPN (corporeality produced by nutriment), are designated as ***āhāra*** (nourishment). Although it is designated on nutriments produced by four causes as "nourishment  *(**āhāra**)",*  the  function  of  nourishing  can  be  performed  only  when  that nourishment is ingested by  making palmful food etc.  It is unable to function when it is standing in external. Due to capability to function of nourishment only when palmful food etc, is ingested, the Buddha had never preached *"**āhāra**"* without prefix called *"**kabaļīkāra**"* but usually preached as *"**kabaļīkāra āhāra**".* In other words, due to occurrence of standing place called ingestible nourishment, the term *"**kabaļīkāra**"* is the name of those nutriments produced by four causes. ***(Abhi-A-3-377)*** 

**PAGE-407** 

Because the nutriments called those nutriments produced by four causes stands in the food "made into palmful ball", it can be said *"**kabaļīkāra**"* by metaphorical usage of the name of  food  ***kabaļīkāra***  which  is  the  standing  place  *(**ṭhāna**)*  on  nutriments  *(**āhāra**)*  which  is capable of standing *(**ṭhānī**),* i.e., the preaching methodology called ***ṭhānyūpacāra**.* *(*Detailed explanation can be seen in Volume I, Section 4.*)* 

2. **The nature of *upatthambhakatta*** 
PAGE7

***satipi  janakatte  upatthambhakattam  āhārānam  padhānakiccanti  āha   “rūpārūpānam upatthambhakattena” ti. (Mūlaṭī-3-172*)** 

The nutriment consisting in the food "made into palmful ball" *(**kabaļīkāra āhāra**)* possesses  efficiency  of  ***janaka***  which  is  able  to  produce  directly  corporeality  called ***ojāṭṭhamaka  āhāraja**  **rūpa**.*  However  those  nutriments  produced  by  four  causes,  i.e., ***kammaja ojā, cittaja ojā, utuja ojā*** and ***āhāraja ojā**,* which is consisting in preceding other corporeal  units  called  ***āhāraja  kalāpa**,*  have  the  efficiency  of  ***upatthambhaka***  (== supporting) only. The word "support" means that it is capable of supporting for continuous occurrence  of  corporealities produced by  those  four  kinds  of  nutriments.  Only  when  the supporting factor of ***āhāraja** **ojā*** consisting in ***kabaļīkāra*** has been obtained, can those four kinds  of  nutriments  produce  respective  corporeality  called  ***ojāṭṭhamaka**  **rūpa**.*  (See  ***rūpa** **kammaṭṭhāna*** inVolume I.) 

When the food is ingested the nutriments consisting in corporeal units produced by temperature  disperse  throughout  body  by  the  help  of  fire-element  consisting  in  nonads produced  by  ***kamma**  (**jīvita  navaka  kalāpa**)*  resulting  in  occurrence  of  ***āhāraja**  **ojā*** throughout body. Because those ***āhāraja ojā*** support nutriments consisting in corporeal units produced by four causes, new generations of corporeal units called ***ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa kalāpa*** occur resulting in invigorating throughout body. It should be discerned carefully. 

**Mental nutriment** — Those mental nutriments called contact-volition-consciousness also  have  efficiency  of  ***janaka***  which  is  capable  of  producing  consciousness,  mental concomitants, CPM, and CPK of process of NONE. 

Among those preaching methodologies of dependent origination, which are explained by example of creeper-collector, mentioned above, a kind of preaching methodology in which four  nutriments  are  preached  as  beginning  is  also  involved.  Especially,  those  mental nutriments called contact-volition-consciousness which are belonging to past circle of deed *(**kamma** **vaṭṭa**),* which are associating with wholesome impulsions, have efficiency of ***janaka*** which is capable of producing ***dhammas*** of circle of consequence *(**vipāka** **vaṭṭa**),* present process of NONE *(**paṭisandhi**)* etc. Similarly those mental nutriments, which are belonging to present circle of deed, have efficiency of ***janaka*** which is capable of producing ***dhammas*** of circle  of  consequence,  future process  of NONE  etc, directly.  However  in  this  section  of ***āhāra** **paccaya**,* it does not refer to that efficiency of ***janaka**.* 

Although corporeal and mental nutriments have efficiency of ***janaka*** in that way, due to presence of predominant efficiency of supporting *(**upatthambhaka**)* rather than that of ***janaka**  —*  the  commentary  explained  that  **“*rūpārūpānam  upatthambhakattena*"**  =  "four kinds of nutriments, which are capable of benefiting to corporeal and mental ***dhammas*** by means of occurrence of supporting, are called the __relation of nutriment *(āhāra paccaya).*__ *(__Mūlaṭī__-__3-__*__172__) 

**PAGE-408** 

Both causal and resultant ***dhammas*** are present ***dhammas**.* 

This is a kind of relation in which mentality and corporeality benefit mentality and 

corporeality.

***āhārapaccayena  paccayo  hoti,  sesatisantati  samuṭṭhānassa  anupālakova  hutvā āhārapaccayena paccayo hoti. (Abhi-A-3-37S)*** 

The Buddha had been preached generally the fact that ***kabaļīkāra āhāra*** called four kinds of nutriments produced by four causes, which are belonging to four kinds of corporeal continuities, benefit this body by means of the relation of nutriment. Although it has been preached generally in that way, especially the nutriment called ***kabaļīkāra** **āhāra*** benefits CPN (corporeality produced by nutriment) in order to both occur and protect by means of the relation of nutriment. It benefits remaining three kinds of corporeal continuities, i.e., CPK, CPM, CPT, in order to protect only by means of the relation of nutriment *(**āhāra** **paccaya**). (**Abhi-A-3-378***) (See scrutiny in ***rūpa** **kammaṭṭhāna**,* Section IV, Volume I.) 

16. ***indriya paccaya* (the relation of controlling faculty)** 

Those  (20)  kinds  of  controlling  faculties  *(**indriya**),*  excluding  femininity  and masculinity,  which  are  capable  of  benefiting  by  the  nature  of  occurrence  of  controlling principle, by the nature of occurrence of lord and master of relating ***dhammas*** with itself, are called the **relation of controlling faculty *(indriya paccaya),***

17. ***aññātā-indriya***     = the reason: "I-have-known", which is a knowledge associating with consciousness of Fruit of Arahant *(**arahatta phala**)* 

These are of 20 kinds which are deserving to occur as causal ***dhammas*** of the relation of controlling faculty.

2. ***vatthu  purejātindriya  paccaya*  (the  relation  of  basic  pre-compatible  controlling faculty)** 

Those five kinds of controlling faculties called eye-ear-nose-tongue-body, which are middle life-span and are arising simultaneously with past life-continuum *(**atīta bhavańga**),* benefit  respective  mental  ***dhammas***  which  occur  depending  upon  them  by  means  of  the relation of basic precompatible controlling faculty *(**vatthu-purejātindriya paccaya**).* 

By means of the relation of basic precompatible controlling faculty, 

1. ***cakkh-indriya*** benefits seeing-consciousness element and associating ***dhammas**,* 
1. ***sot**-**indriya*** benefits hearing-consciousness element and associating ***dhammas*** 
1. ***ghān**-**indriya*** benefits smelling-consciousness element and associating ***dhammas*** 
1. ***jivh**-**indriya*** benefits touching-consciousness element and associating ***dhammas*** 
1. ***kāy-indriya***  benefits  touching-consciousness  element  and  associating  ***dhammas*** respectively. 

Due  to  occurrence  of  dependence  of  respective  five-fold-consciousness  and associating ***dhammas*** and due to simultaneous occurrence with past life-continuum, which is fourth mind moment before five-fold-consciousness and associating ***dhammas*** occur, it is called  ***vatthu**  **purejāta**  (=*  basic  precompatible).  Those  basic  corporealities  called  ***vatthu** **purejāta*** are capable of benefiting to respective mental ***dhammas*** which occur depending upon them by the nature of occurrence of controlling principle, by the nature of occurrence of lord and master of relating ***dhammas*** with itself. Those ***dhammas**,* therefore, are designated as ***vatthu** **purejātindriya** **paccaya**.* Those causal ***dhammas*** benefit resultant ***dhammas*** from the arising stage to perishing stage by the relation of controlling faculty *(**indriya** **paccaya**).* It should  be  understood  the  fact  that  if  eye-base  is  lacking,  seeing-consciousness  and associating ***dhammas*** will be unable to arise.

Due  to  occurrence  of  eye-base  *(**cakkhu**  **vatthu**),*  feeling  aggregate  of  seeing- consciousness occurs. Those ways of discerning, such as "eye-base is the causal ***dhamma*** while  feeling  aggregate  of  seeing-consciousness  is the  resultant ***dhammas***  etc"  shown  in previous section concern with this relation. 

3. ***rūpajlvitindriya paccaya* (the relation of physical vital controlling faculty)** 
6. The controlling faculty of physical vitality *(**rūpajīvitindriya**)* benefits CPK within same corporeal unit by means of the relation of controlling faculty. 

[If it is decad, such as eye-decad, vitality benefits remaining (9) kinds of CPK within same corporeal unit and if it is nonad, such as vital nonad *(**jīvita navaka**),* vitality benefits remaining (8) kinds of CPK within same corporeal unit at the moment of static stage *(**ṭhiti** **khaņa**)* by means of the relation of controlling faculty. ***(Abhi-A-3-379)***] 

4. ***sahajātindriya paccaya* (the relation of compatible controlling faculty)** 
7. Mental  controlling  faculties  including  mental  vitality  benefit  associating  ***dhammas*** with themselves and CPK of the process of NONE *(**paṭisandhi**)* and CPM by means of the relation of compatible controlling faculty. 

When  those  causal  ***dhammas***  of  mental  controlling  faculty  benefit  associating ***dhammas*** and ***tam samuṭṭhāna rūpa*** by the relation of controlling faculty, with regarding to ***tam samuṭṭhāna** **rūpa**,* it must be counted (interpreted) not only CPM but also ***kaṭattā** **rūpa*** (= CPK of the process of NONE). 

In the ***Pāli*** Text called ***Pañhāvāra*** the Buddha preached as follows: — 

8. At the moment of process of NONE *(**paṭisandhi**)* those causal ***dhammas*** of mental controlling  faculty,  which  are  consequent  indifferent  ones  *(**vipāka  avyākata**),* benefit both associating mental aggregates and CPK of process of NONE *(**katattā** **rūpa**)* by the relation of compatible controlling faculty. *(**Paṭṭhāna**-**1-157**)* 
5. ***itthindriya purisindriya* (femininity, masculinity)** 

In  the  continuum  of  women  with  ***itthindriya***  (=  sex  corporeality  of  femininity), tapering fingers and toes etc called ***linga**,* (feature), smiling style, laughing style etc, called ***nimitta*** (sign), playing way of girl with round bamboo tray etc called ***kutta*** (= behaviour), walking  style  and  action  of  women  etc  called  ***ākappa***  (=  appearance)  occurs.  In  the continuum of men with ***purindriya*** (= sex corporeality of masculinity), stout fingers and toes etc, called ***linga**;* smiling style, laughing style etc called ***nimitta**;* playing way of boy called ***kutta**,* walking style and action of men etc, called ***ākappa**,* occur respectively. 

Those controlling faculties of femininity and masculinity are sources of feature of woman, feature **of** man; sign of woman, sigh of man; behaviour of woman, behaviour of man; appearance of woman, appearance of man actually. Nevertheless, because those feature of woman, feature of man, sign of woman, sign of man, etc, are absent in the beginning of process of NONE although those femininity and masculinity are obviously present at that time, those ***itthindriya*** and ***purisindriya*** are unable to spread out efficiency of controlling faculty on the feature of woman, feature of man etc. They are unable to spread out efficiency of controlling faculty on other CPK of the same corporeal unit similarly. It is right. — There 
PAGE11

is nothing that is unable to spread out efficiency of controlling faculty on nondifferentiatable corporeal and mental ***dhammas** (=* only corporeal and mental units are nondifferentiatable ones but are differentiatable and knowable by knowledge) because every ***indriya** **paccaya*** is unseparable one at the present moment of itself in three-time-phases, ***uppāda**, **ṭhiti**, **bhańga**.* Therefore  those  ***itthindriya***  and  ***purisindriya***  are  not  concerned  with  the  relation  of controlling faculty. ***(Abhi-A-*3-378)** 

**PAGE-411** 

Although  ***itthindriya***  and  ***purisindriya***  are  not  concerned  with  the  relation  of controlling faculty, in that way, these controlling faculties are sources of such feature of woman,  feature  of  man  etc.  According  to  the  preaching  methodology  of  ***Suttanta***  (= ***suttantika priyāya**),* those ***itthindriya*** and ***purisindriya*** approach to the occurrence of the relation of natural determinative dependence *(**pakatūpa** **nissaya** **paccaya**)* for those feature of woman, feature of man etc. It should, therefore, be recognized that causal ***dhammas*** as the relation of controlling faculty  exist by means of (20)  kinds of controlling faculties only. ***(Abhi-A-3-378)*** 

Both causal and resultant ***dhammas*** are present ***dhammas**.* 

This is a kind of relation in which mentality and corporeality benefit mentality and 

corporeality.

***Jhāna* (absorption)** — There are two kinds of ***jhāna**,* to wit, ***ārammaņūpanijjhāna*** and ***lakkhaņūpanijjhāna**.* Among those two kinds, (8) kinds of attainments *(**samāpatti**)* are designated as ***ārammaņūpanijjhāna*** due to ability to discern penetratively and firmly on the object of sign of ***samatha**,* earth-***kasiņa*** etc. ***Vipassanā*** knowledge, the Path-Knowledge and Fruit-Knowledge  are  designated  as  ***lakkhaņūpanijjhāna.***  Among  those  knowledges, ***vipassanā***  knowledge,  due  to  ability  to  discern  penetratively  and  fixedly  on  general characters, ***anicca*** etc, of ***sańkhāra** **dhammas**,* is called ***lakkhaņūpanijjhāna**.* Because the function that penetrative and fixed discerning on general characters, ***anicca*** etc, of ***sańkhāra** **dhamma**,*  which  is  deserving  to  perform  by  means  of  ***vipassanā***  knowledge,  has  been fulfilled by the Path-Knowledge, the latter is designated as ***lakkhaņūpanijjhāna**.* *(*Because the  Noble  Path  obtains  the  benefiting  efficiency  of  ***Nibbāna***  "the  unconditioned"  (and unproductive of  further  life) called ***asańkhata*** by  the relation of object, it eradicates the delusion *(**moha**),* which is capable of concealing general characters, ***anicca*** etc, of ***sańkhāra** **dhamma*** without any remains. Because the ignorance (delusion) is eradicated, recognition of the  "truth"  is  completely  fulfilled.  Complete  fulfilment  in  this  way  is  called  complete fulfilment  by  ***kicca  siddhi***  (the  function  which  ought  to  be  done  is  well  accomplished). Therefore the Noble Path is designated as ***lakkhaņūpanijjhāna*** by means of ***kicca siddhi**.)* The Noble Fruition *(**ariya phala**),* indeed, is called ***lakkhaņūpanijjhāna*** due to capability to

1. Those ***dhammas*** of factors of absorption benefit both associating mental ***dhamma*** with absorption and ***tam** **samutthāna** **rūpa*** (= CPM and CPK of process of NONE) by means of the relation of absorption. (***Paṭṭhāna-l-8***) 
1. At  the  moment  of  process  of  NONE,  those  consequent  indifferent  factors  of absorption  *(**vipāka  avyākata jhānańga**)* benefit both  associating  mental ***dhammas*** with  themselves  and  CPK  of  the  process  of  NONE  by  means  of  the  relation  of absorption. (***Abhi-A-3-350,* Vs.2-170,171**) 

Causal ***dhammas*** are seven factors of absorption, basically five kinds of factors of absorption, viz., ***vitakka, vicāra, pīti, vedanā*** (feeling), ***ekaggatā**.* Resultant ***dhammas*** are (79) kinds of consciousness excluding (10) kinds of two-fivefold-consciousness *(**dve pañca viññāņa**);*  (52)  kinds  of  mental  concomitants,  CPM,  and  CPK  of  process  of  NONE *(**paṭisandhi**).* 

***dve pañca viññāņa* (two-fivefold-consciousness)** — Due to occurrence of merely falling  on  respective  object,  visible-object  etc,  and  due  to  absence  of  ability  to  discern penetratively and fixedly on objects which are general characters, ***anicca*** etc and concept of ***kasiņa***  by  feelings  called  ***upekkhā-sukha**-**dukkha***  which  are  obviously  present  in components  of  those  fivefold  consciousness  *(**pañca**  **viññāņa**  **kāya**)*  those  feeling  are  not extracted  (designated)  as  factors  of  absorption  *(**jhāna**-**ańga**)*  in  the  ***Pāli***  Text  called ***Dhammasańganī**.* Furthermore, it should be recognized the fact that factors of absorption are not extracted from remaining rootless consciousness *(**ahetuka citta**)* other than ***dve** **pañca** **viññāņa**,* due to occurrence of assessment of factor of absorption in those components of fivefold consciousness. *(**Abhi-A-3-379**)* 

According to this explanation of commentary — it should be recognized the fact that those factors of absorption consisting in rootless consciousness are not concerned with the relation  of  absorption.  With  relating  to  this  explanation,  it  was  scrutinized  in  detail  in ***Mūlaṭīkā-3-.74, Mahāṭīkā-2-283,284**.* The essence of meaning is as follows: \_\_\_\_

Both causal and resultant ***dhammas*** are present ***dhammas**.*  

This is a kind of relation in which mentality benefits mentality and corporeality.

- This relation of absorption *(**jhāna** **paccaya**)* can not be extracted from two-fivefold-

should not be extracted from rootless consciousness *(**ahetuka** **citta**).* *(*It means that those basic path-constituents, which are associating with rootless consciousness, are not deserving to designated as the relation of Path *(**magga** **paccaya**).)* 

**PAGE-414** 

In  these  both  kinds  of  relations  of  absorption  and  Path,  with  regarding  to  *tarn **samuṭṭhāna rūpa**,* it should be counted on not only CPM but also CPK of the process of NONE commonly. _(**Abhi-A-3-379,**_ **380**) 

Causal ***dhammas*** are twelvefold path-constituents. If it is counted as basically, causal ***dhammas***  are  nine  kinds  of  path-constituents.  Resultant  ***dhammas***  are  (71)  kinds  of consciousness with root, (52) kinds of mental concomitants, CPM of being with root, CPK of process of NONE of being with **root** *(**sahetuka paṭisandhi** **kammaja** **rūpa**).* 

Both causal and resultant ***dhammas*** are present ***dhammas**.* This is a kind of relation in which mentality benefits mentality and corporeality. 

**2.3.19** 

1. ***sampayutta paccaya* (the relation of association)** 

Those mental ***dhammas*** which are capable of benefiting by means of occurrence of associating with each other in various ways, such as, 

1. occurrence of presence of same dependence base (It refers to five-groups-existence) 
1. occurrence of presence of same object 
1. occurrence of presence of synchronous arising 
1. occurrence of presence of synchronous cessation, are called the **relation of association *(sampayutta paccaya).*** (***Abhi.A.m.351, Vs.II.171***) 

***cattāro  khańdhā  arupino  aññamaññnam  sampayuttapaccayenapaccayo. (Paṭṭhāna.l.8)*** 

- Four kinds **of** mental aggregates benefit each other by means of the relation **of** 

association. *(**Pattṭhāna 1.8**)* 

1. One kind of mental aggregate benefits three kinds of mental aggregates, 
1. three kinds of mental aggregates benefit one kind of mental aggregates, 
1. two kinds of mental aggregates benefit two kinds of mental aggregates respectively. *(**Abhi-A.3.381**)* 

***ekavatthukaekārammaņaekuppādekanirodhasańkhātena  sampayuttabhāvena upakārakā arūpadhammā sampayuttapaccayo. (Abhi.A.3.35*1)** 

Order of associating characters shown in above commentary is different from that of associating characters shown in portion of mental concomitants, ***Abhidhammaṭṭhasańgaha**.* It  should,  therefore,  be  recognized  how  it  is  arranged  in  ***Visuddhimagga  Mahāaṭīkā. 2.284,285)*** 

Due to occurrence of associating harmoniously and variously, the occurrence of capable of benefiting as reaching into single occurrence, .is called the relation of association. Due to presence  of  reasonable  question  that  which  is  occurrence  of  associating  variously,  the commentator  Sayadaw  explained  that  *"**ekavattuka-ekā-rammaņa-ekuppāda-ekanirodha sańkhātena**".* There are four kinds of associating characters, viz., 
PAGE15

1. ***ekavatthuka***  =     presence of same dependence 
1. ***ekārammarta***   =     presence of same object 
1. ***ekuppāda**  =*     presence of synchronous arising 
1. ***ekanirodha***  =     presence of synchronous cessation.  

**PAGE-415** 

With  relating  to  the  way  of  associating,  ***Mahāṭīkā***  Sayadaw  explained  in ***Anuṭīīkā.3.237*** as follows:\_\_\_\_\_ 

With regarding to the word, "stagecoach which is yoking with horse", the horse and stagecoach are not associating with each other but yoking with each other. When the mind and  mental  concomitants  are  associating  with  each  other,  as  butter,  sesame  oil,  honey, molasses are not only associating with each other but also mixing together without separable situation  in  order  to  make  electuary  made  of  four  ingredients  *(**catu  madhura**),*  they  are mixing with each other in order to form without easy separable situation although they have specific  characters  respectively  and  this  kind  of  mixing  together  can  be  designated  as ***sampayutta* (= association).** That kind of associating, indeed, is the nature of coalescing. The nature of coalescing in that way is the occurrence of mind and mental concomitants which are coming together so as to form one whole although they have various specific characters due to association of at least (7) mental concomitants with one consciousness. It can be pointed out  the  way  of benefiting  as  to  form  one  whole by  means  of  occurrence  of  cooperative functioning  of  those  mind  and  mental  concomitants  which  have  specific  functions respectively. ***(Anuṭī.3.237)*** 

***ekārammaņa —*** If only  one  character, ***ekavatthuka*** that - "those  mental ***dhammas*** which have the same dependence", is intended to be said, for the person who reasons that "three kinds of great elements and derived corporealities within one corporeal unit have the same dependence", it can be misunderstood in a way that those corporeal ***dhammas**,* which are  inseparable  ones,  are  causal  and  resultant  ***dhammas***  of  the  relation  of  association ***(sampayutta paccaya paccayuppannd)**.* 

In  other  words  —  Derived  corporealities,  eye-base  *(**cakkhu**  **vatthu**)*  etc,  occur depending  upon  respective  great  elements  within  same  corporeal  unit.  Therefore,  in  the continuum of a person who reasons that "those four great elements are ***ekavatthuka*** due to presence of only one basic corporeality *(**vatthu rūpa**),* eye-base etc", it can be misunderstood in a way that those corporeal ***dhammas*** are causal and resultant ***dhammas*** of the relation of association. Therefore, another one character called ***ekārammaņa*** is shown again in order to prohibit  the  occurrence  of  those  corporeal  ***dhammas***  so  as  to  form  causal  and  resultant ***dhammas*** of association. It means that there is no doubt as "is it the relation of association?" ... because those corporeal ***dhammas*** are ***anārammaņa** **dhammas*** which are incapable of taking objects resulting in inability to occur as ***ekārammaņa**.* 

***ekuppāda** —* If the cognitive process adjacent to death consciousness *(**maraņāsanna vīthi**)* is any one kind among five-door-cognitive processes *(**pañca** **dvāra vīthi**)* those thought moments,  receiving  and  investigation  within  that  cognitive  process  have  the  same dependence *(**ekavatthuka**)* and the same object *(**ekārammaņa**)* because they occur depending upon last heart-base which occurs at the arising stage of 17th mind moment backward from death-consciousness  and  then  they  take  an  appropriate  object,  colour-object  etc,  amongst fivefold-objects *(**pañcārammaņa**).* Due to this reason there is a doubt whether they are causal and  resultant  ***dhammas***  of  the  relation  of  association.  Therefore,  the  third  character, ***ekuppāda*** is shown again in order to prohibit those consciousness which are asynchronous arising. Among those consciousness, receiving, investigation, determination, impulsion etc 

Translated by - ***Aññatara Bhikkhu*** \*  PAGE18

occur  successively  one  after  another  with  the  result  that  different  consciousness  are  not concerned with the relation of association due to presence of asynchronous arising. 

**PAGE-416** 

***ekanirodha** —* It is scrutinized whether those ***dhammas*** with asynchronous cessation are completed with three characters in this way or whether those ***dhammas*** with synchronous cessation  are  completed  with  these  three  characters.  Then  the  character,  ***ekanirodha**,*  is shown again in order to show that "only those ***dhammas*** with synchronous cessation are completed with these three characters". 

2. **Explanation of another way** 

Then if it is explained in reverse order, it will be as follows: — 

If it is said that ***ekanirodha** **dhamma**,* which have synchronous cessation, are called the relation of association, those corporeal and mental ***dhamma**,* which have synchronous cessation, will be occurred as the relation of association. Therefore, it is continued to say ***"ekuppāda".*** 

Although  it  can  be  said  in  that  way,  those  inseparable  corporealities  within  same corporeal unit have these two characters, synchronous arising and cessation with the result that they are also concerned with the relation of association. Therefore, it is added the word, ***"ekārammaņa",*** again in order to prohibit the occurrence of those corporeal ***dhamma*** as the relation of association. It means that it is intended to preach only mental ***dhammas*** called ***sārammaņa dhamma*** which are capable of taking object, as the relation of association. 

As if such ***dhammas\_\_\_\_\_*** 

1. have the same object *(**ekārammaņa**),* 
1. have synchronous arising *(**ekuppāda**),* 
1. have synchronous cessation *(**ekanirodha**),* 

those ***dhammas*** are designated as the relation  of association. This method can be applied on only mental ***dhammas*** with same dependence (in five-groups-existence). Then it is  performed  to  add  the  word,  ***ekavatthuka,***  again  in  order  to  show  that  those  mental ***dhammas*** with different dependence should not be concerned. 

With regarding to these words, — "as if such ***dhammas*** have the same dependence, the same object, the synchronous arising, the synchronous cessation, those ***dhammas*** are the relation of association, the word, "presence of same dependence" is intended to be said on five-groups-existence considerately. In the immaterial sphere, indeed, how is it affected by the word, *"**ekavatthuka**".* It means that it can not. _(**Mahāṭī.1.**_**284,285**) 

Both causal and resultant ***dhammas*** are present ***dhammas*** which are reaching in three- time-phases, ***uppāda**, **ṭhiti**, **bhańga**.*

This is a kind of relation in which the mentality benefits mentality only.

3. **Colour-object etc do not concerned with the relation of dissociation** 

Among corporeal ***dhammas**,* only six kinds of basic corporealities called eye-base, ear-base, nose-base, tongue-base, body-base, heart-base, benefit mental aggregates by means of the relation of dissociation. Those objective corporeal ***dhammas**,* colour-object etc, may be concerned with the relation of dissociation for mental ***dhammas**,* which are capable of taking object  *(**ārammaņika**).*  But  they  are  not  concerned  with  the  relation  of  dissociation.  It  is because the fact that \_\_\_ due to absence of any doubt in the occurrence of the relation of association, it was never preached by the Buddha. 

**Detailed explanation** — Mental  aggregates, seeing-consciousness etc, seem to be rising up from dependence bases, eye-base, etc. Therefore it is preached on the fact that basic corporealities  are  the  relation  of  basic  pre-compatible  dissociation  *(**vatthu**  **purejāta** **vippayutta** **paccaya**)* due to presence of doubt whether those dependence basic corporealities and dependable mental ***dhammas*** are concerned with each other by the relation of association or dissociation. Those objective ***dhammas**,* colour-object etc, are only objects to be known by mental ***dhammas**,* seeing-consciousness etc, which are occurring depending upon corporeal ***dhammas**,* eye-base etc. Therefore, there is no doubt in the occurrence of association between objective corporeal ***dhammas**,* colour object etc, and mental ***dhammas**,* seeing-consciousness etc, really. Due to absence of any doubt on the occurrence of association in this way, those objective  corporeal  ***dhammas**,*  colour-object  etc,  are  not  concerned  with  the  relation  of dissociation.  It  should  be  recognized  the  occurrence  of  relation  of  dissociation  in  basic corporealities, heart-base etc. It should be read the following ***Pāli*** Text, ***Pañāvāra**,* as an evidence.*** 

***vatthukhandhānam  vipayuttapaccayena  paccayo.  purajātam  cakkhāyatanam cakkhuviññāņassa  vipayuttapaccayena  paccayo.  sota,  ghāna,  jivhā,  kāyāyatanam kāyaviññāņassa vipayuttapaccayena paccayo. vatthu vipākābyākatānam kiriyābyākatānam khandhānam vipayuttapaccayena paccayo. pa .purajātam vatthu*** 

_**kusalānam**  **khandhānam  vipayuttapaccayena  paccayo.  purejātam  vatthu  akusalānam khandhānam vipayuttapaccayena paccayo. (Paṭṭhāna.**_**1-159,160, _Abhi.A.3_.381,382)** 

4. ***arūpino dhammā rūpīnam dhammānam*** 

In the fact saying as mental ***dhammas*** benefits corporeal ***dhammas*** by means of the relation of dissociation, it should be recognized by means of four mental aggregates among those  mental  ***dhammas***  called  ***arūpa**  **dhamma**.*  Among  mental  ***dhammas***  called  ***arūpa*** 
PAGE19

***dhamma**,* only four mental aggregates are causal ***dhammas*** of the relation of dissociation with  corporeal  ***dhammas***  which  are  still  reaching  in  static  stage  of  corporeality  and  are arising simultaneously with themselves as compatible ones.

***nibbānam  pana  arūpampi  samānam  rūpassa  vipayuttapaccayo  na  hoti.  "catuhi sampayogo satuhi vippayogo” ti hi vuttam. (Abhi.A.3.382)*** 

Although the Noble Supreme ***dhamma*** called ***nibbāna**,* is a kind of mental ***dhamma** (**arūpa**  **dhammā**),*  it  is  not  a  causal  ***dhamma***  of  corporeal  ***dhamma***  as  the  relation  of dissociation.  The  Buddha preached  that *"**catuhi sampayogo  catuhi  vippayogo**"  —*  etc.  It should, therefore, be recognized on only four kinds of mental aggregates as the relation of dissociation. _(**Abhi.A.ll.8S2, Paṭṭhāna**_ **.1.159**) 

The  noble preaching  that *"**catuhi sampayogo  catuhi  vippayogo**"  —*  is the  speech showing characters of association and dissociation, found in ***lakkhaņa mātikā, Dhātukaṭhā**,* indeed. Due to occurrence of association among four mental aggregates in that way, the Buddha preached on them as the relation of association. Due to presence of a doubt whether those  are  the  relation  of  association  during  compatible  arising  of  either  mentality  and corporeality or corporeality and mentality, it was preached as the relation of dissociation. It was never preached emphatically as the relation of dissociation among corporeal ***dhammas*** due to absence of doubt in that way. Due to absence of any doubt in the Noble Supreme ***nibbāna*** as whether the relation of association or dissociation with corporeal ***dhamma**,* the Buddha never preached on ***nibbāna*** as the relation of dissociation. 

Both kinds of causal and resultant ***dhammas*** are present ***dhammas**.* 

This is a kind of relation in which mentality benefit corporeality and corporeality benefit mentality. 

21. ***atthipaccaya* (the relation of presence)** 

***paccuppannalakkhaņena  atthibhāvena  tādisasseva  dhammassa upatthambhakattena upakārako dhammo atthipaccayo. (Abhi.A.3.35\)* (Vs.2.171)** 

The ***dhamma*** which is capable of benefiting by means of occurrence of presence nature and occurrence of ability to support obvious present ***dhamma**,* is called the **relation of presence *(atthipaccaya).*** 

1. ***paccuppanna lakkhaņa*** 

***paccuppannalakkhanenati** **paccuppannasabhdvena**. (**Mahāaṭī.II.286**)* 

The term, ***lakkhaņa**,* means nature. According to that explanation, '*'**paccuppanna**'* means the nature which has been finished to arise but not reach to perishing stage *(**bhańga** **kālad**)* for present ultimate ***dhamma**.* 

* ***āraddhāniṭṭhito bhāvo paccuppanno. (Kaccāyanasāra.22.* verse)** 
- The  performance  which  has  been  finished  to  begin  but  not  finish  yet  is  called 

*"'**paccuppanna**''1* (presence). 

2. **Three kinds of presence *(atthibhāva)*** 

Translated by - ***Aññatara Bhikkhu*** \*  PAGE22

There are three kinds of presence *(**atthibhāva**),* viz, 

1. ***nibbattatā** **lakkhaņa** - **atthibhāva*** 
- The ***atthibhāva*** which has a nature called occurrence that had been done, 
2. ***upalabbamānatā** **lakkhaņa** - **atthibhāva*** 
- The ***atthibhāva*** which has a nature called occurrence should be got as worldly saying  

**PAGE-420** 

3. ***paccuppanna** **lakkhaņa** - **atthibhāva*** 
- The ***atthibhāva*** which is the nature of presence. 

Among those three kinds, due to presence of intention to prohibit previous two kinds, the commentator Sayadaw emphatically applied the term, ***paccuppanna** **lakkhaņa**".* 

1) ***nibbattatā lakkhaņa - atthibhāva*** 

In this kind of saying that — ***"atthi me pāpakammam katam".*** (***M.S.203***), = "bad deed which** had been** done is present in me", — this kind of ***atthibhāva**,* which is modified by the nature of occurrence that had been done, is not a kind of ***atthibhāva**,* which is applied for present three-time-phases, ***uppāda**-**ṭhiti**-**bhańga**.* Because the result is not given rise to occur yet by bad deed which had been done, this kind of ***atthibhāva*** which is usually said as worldly usage that — "unwholesome deeds, which are embedded in corporeal and mental continuities, are present in me in order to feel bad result". That kind of ***atthibhāva*** is called ***nibbattatā** **lakkhaņa** - **atthibhāva** =* the ***atthibhāva*** which has a nature called occurrence that had been done. 

In  those  words,  *"**atthi**  **me  pāpa-kammam  katam**",*  the  term,  ***katam**,*  is  a  verb- determined  (predicative)  with  nominal  determination,  "done",  "made",  and  it  refers  past tense. Therefore the words, "bad deed which had been done is present", refers not a kind of ***atthi*** which is the nature of presence. It refers not only past but also already finished to cease. If it is so, there is a reasonable question that "why is it said as, *''**atthi** =* is present'." The answer is that — because it is present as the potentiality of ***kamma*** in the continuities of aggregates before the consequence has not been given rise to occur yet, it can be said as *"**atthi** =* is present". (***Mulaṭī.III.175***) 

The  occurrence  of  "had  been  done,"  shows  the  occurrence  of  verb-determinant, "done", not the occurrence of "have being done". Therefore it is designated as ***nibbattatā** **lakkhaņa** **atthibhāva**.* The meaning is that — "because the consequence of ***kamma*** has not finished yet, the occurrence of *"**atthi**"* in this saying — *"**atthi** **me pāpakammam** **katam**",* should be recognized actually". *(**Anuṭī.lll.238**)* 

2) ***upalabbhamānatā lakkhaņa — atthibhāva*** 

***atthe kacco puggalo (atthi puggalo) attahitāya paṭipanno. (Abhi.lll.l09)*** 

- "Some persons who practise for their welfare are present". In this kind of saying — 

it is a kind **of *atthibhāva*** which has a nature called occurrence should be got as worldly saying due to presence **of** availableness of the usage of "person *(**puggala**)"* in conventional concept of terminology and due to continuous occurrence of continuities of five aggregates on which that concept is obsessed. Actually, it is not a kind of ***atthibhāva*** which is available as  three-time-phases  in  the  aspect  of  ultimate  sense.  It  means  that  —  the  commentator 
PAGE21

Sayadaw  applied  the  adjective,  *"**paccuppanna**  **lakkhaņena**",*  in  order  to  prohibit  various undesired **kinds of***'"**atthibhāva**". (**Mulaṭī.111.175**)* 

The usage, "person *(**puggala**)",* is obviously absent in the aspect of ultimate sense. However, due **to** presence of concept of name in the conventional truth which is cognizable with  mind,  it  is  said  as  *"**upalabbhamānatā**  **lakkhaņa**  **atthibhāva**".*  The  term, *"**upalabbhamāna**"* means the concept of name called the "person" which is worldly usage should be available in mind by means of worldling symbol. 

**PAGE-421** 

In other words — Because dependence of concept of name called "person" is five aggregates  and  continuities  of  those  aggregates  are  ceaseless  ones,  it  can  be  said  as *"**atthibhāva**'''* which has *"**upalabbhamāna** **lakkhaņa**".* In this method, the term "person" is available  by  means  of  not  only  worldly  symbol  but  also  natural  occurrence,  it  means *"**upalabbhamānatā**-**atthibhāva**"'. (**Amiṭī.lll.238**)* 

3) ***paccuppanna0 lakkhaņa - atthibhāva*** 

It is obvious nature of presence which is cognizable as "presence" in which both causal and resultant ***dhammas*** are really ultimate ***dhammas*** which have not reach perishing stage yet. That kind of ***atthibhāva*** is favourable in this case. Obvious "presence" of causal ***dhammas*** in the aspect of ultimate sense is causality to arise resultant ***dhammas**.* It means that obvious presence of causal ***dhamma*** is designated as the relation of presence *(**atthi** **paccaya**).* 

***apicesa  atthipaccayo  nāma  sańkhepato  khaņattayappattam  nāmañceva  rūpañca, vattamānā pañcakkhandhātipivattum vaṭṭati. (Abhi.A.3.3S4)*** 

In other words, this relation of presence is briefly either mentality or corporeality which is still reaching in three-time-phases, ***uppāda**-**ṭhiti**-**bhańga**.* It can be said that five aggregates  which  are  occurring  as  present  instant  are  the  relations  of  presence. ***(Abhi.A..111.384)*** 

3. ***upatthambhakatta*** 

***satipi  janakatte  upatthambhakattappadhānā  atthibhāvena  upakārakatāti  āha "upatthambhakattenā"  ti.  Idañca  upatthambhakattam  vatthārammaņasahajātādīnam sādhāranam atthibhāvena. upakārakattanti daṭṭhabbam. (Mūlaī.lll.175, Mahāṭī.II.286)*** 

Although it is a kind of ***atthibhāva*** which is available from arising stage to perishing stage of corporeal and mental ***dhammas*** called ***paccuppanna** **paramattha** **dhamma*** due to reaching in three-time-phases, at the static stage the occurrence of capable of supporting is exerting.  Because  of  this  reason,  efficiency  of  supporting  is  explained  irrespective  of presence of efficiency of ***janaka*** which is capable of arising. It should be recognized on occurrence  of  supporting  as  the  occurrence  of  benefiting  by  obvious  present  ***atthibhāva*** relating to basic object *(**vatthārammaņa**)* compatible *(**sahajāta**),* pre-compatible *(**purejāta**),* post compatible *(**pacchājāta**).* (***Mūlaṭī.III.175***) 

Those relations of presence are of six kinds, to wit, 

1) compatible presence *(**sahajātatthi**)* 
1) pre-compatible presence *(**purejātatthi**)* 
1) compatibility-pre-compatible presence *(**sahajāta purejātatthi**)* 

Translated by - ***Aññatara Bhikkhu*** \*  PAGE24

**PAGE-422** 

4) post-compatible presence *(**pacchājātatthi**)* 
4) nutritional presence *(**āhāratthi**)* 
4) physical vitality presence *(**indriyatthi**)* 
1) ***sahajātatthi* (compatible presence)** 

By means of **the relation of compatible presence *(sahajātatthi paccaya),*** 

1) four mental aggregate benefit each other, *(*one kind benefits three kinds; three kinds benefit one kind; two kinds benefit two kinds*)* 
1) four great elements benefit each other, *(*one kind benefits three kinds; three kinds benefit one kind; two kinds benefit two kinds*)* 
1) At the  moment of process of NONE of five-group-existence, corporeality and mentality benefit each other, *(*mental aggregates of process of NONE of five- groups-existence and heart-base benefit each other,*)* 
1) In five-groups-existence, (75) kinds of consciousness, excluding four consequent consciousness  of  immaterial  sphere,  (10)  kinds  of  two-fivefold-consciousness, death-consciousness of arahant; (52) kinds of mental concomitants benefit CPM, 
1) four great elements benefit derived corporealities, 

respectively. 

2) ***purajātatthi* (the same as *purajāta nissayd)*** 

By means of the **relation of basic pre-compatible presence *(vatthu purajātatthi paccaya),***  these  ***dhammas***  which  are  middle  life-span  *(**majjhimāyukā**)*  and  synchronous arising with past life-continuum, i.e., 

1. eye-base  *(**cakkhāyatana**)*  benefits  seeing-consciousness  element  *(**cakkhu**  **viññāņa** **dhātu**)* and associating mental ***dhammas**,* 
1. ear-base *(**sotāyatana**)* benefits hearing-consciousness element *(**sota** **viññāņa** **dhātu**)* and associating mental ***dhammas**,* 
1. nose-base *(**ghānāyatana**)* benefits smelling-consciousness element *(**ghāna** **viññāņa** **dhātu**)* and associating mental ***dhammas**,* 
1. tongue-base  *(**jivhāyatana**)*  benefits  tasting-consciousness  element  *(**jivhā**  **viññāņa** **dhātu**)* and associating mental ***dhammas**,* 
1. body-base  *(**kāyāyatana**)*  benefits  touching-consciousness  element  *(**kāya**  **viññāņa** **dhātu**')* and associating mental ***dhammas**,* 

[In this case, because causal ***dhammas*** arise previously before respective depending mental ***dhammas*** arise and those are still present in three-time-phases of themselves during mental ***dhammas*** are reaching in three-time-phases, ***uppāda**-**ṭhiti**-**bhańga**,* those are called the relation of basic pre-compatible presence *(**vatthu** **purajātatthi** **paccaya**)*]*.* 

By  means  of  **the  relation  of  objective  pre-compatible  presence  *(ārammaņa purajātatthi paccaya),*** these ***dhammas**,* 

6. present  visible-object  benefits  seeing-consciousness  and  associating  mental ***dhammas**,*

8. present  olfactory-object  benefits  smelling-consciousness  element  and  associating mental ***dhammas*** 
8. present  sapid-object benefits  tasting-consciousness  element  and  associating  mental ***dhammas*** 
8. present tactile-object benefits touching-consciousness element and associating mental ***dhammas*** 
8. present visible object, auditory object, olfactory object, sapid object, tactile object benefit five doors advertence and two kinds of receiving called mind-element and associating mental ***dhammas**,* respectively. 

**PAGE-423** 

[In  this  case,  objective  causal  ***dhammas***  arise  previously  before  cognizible  resultant ***dhammas***  arise  and  they  are  still  present  in  static  stage  during  resultant  ***dhammas***  are reaching in three-time-phases, ***uppāda**-**ṭhiti**-**bhańga*** resulting in designation as the relation of objective precompatible presence *(**ārammaņa** **purajātatthi** **paccaya**)*]. 

3) ***sahajāta-purajātatthi*** 

***yam  rūpam  nissāya  manodhātu  ca  manoviññāņadhātu  ca  vattanti,  tam  rūpam manodhātuyā  ca  manoviññāņadhātuyā  ca  tam  sampayuttakānanca  dhammānam atthipaccayenapaccayo. (Paṭṭhāna.1.9)*** 

1. In  five-groups-existence,  at  the  moment  of  process  of  NONE,  heart-base  benefits mental  ***dhumma*  of**  process  of  NONE  by  the  **relation  of  compatible  presence *(sahajātatthi paccaya),*** 
1. during life, the causal ***dhamma**,* heart-base benefits three kinds of mind-elements, 

(72) kinds of mind-consciousness element, excluding four consequent consciousness of immaterial sphere, (52) kinds of mental concomitants which are associating with those mind-element, mind-consciousness-element, by means of the **relation of basic precompatible presence *(vatthu purajātatthi paccaya).*** 

[In the five-groups-existence, at the moment of process of NONE, due to synchronous arising of heart-base and four mental aggregates, that heart-base is causal ***dhamma*** while four mental aggregates of process of NONE are resultant ***dhammas*** as the **relation of compatible presence *(sahajātatthi).*** During life, however, those mental ***dhammas*** arise depending upon previous heart-base which arise synchronously with preceding consciousness, consciousness of process of NONE, etc, with the result that that heart-base is causal ***dhamma**,* while mental aggregates  are  resultant  ***dhammas***  as  in  the  **relation  of  basic  precompatible  presence *(vatthu purejātatthi paccay a).*** With referring to this principle, the commentator explained as follows.\_\_\_\_ 

***yam  rūpam  nissāyāti  ettha  sahajātapurejātavasena  atthipaccayo  niddiṭṭho. (Abhi.A.llI.383)*** 

***hadayavatthu sahajātam vā hotipurejātam vā. (Abhi.A.III.384)*** 

**Way of dividing as two groups system** 

Those relations mentioned above, ***sahajātatthi**, **purejātatthi, sahajāta-purejātatthi**,* can be divided as two groups as follows:\_\_\_\_\_ 

1) ***aññamañña** =* the relation of presence in which mutually benefitable ones involved *and)* 

Translated by - ***Aññatara Bhikkhu*** \*  PAGE26

2) ***no aññamañña** =* the relation of presence in which mutually unbenefitable ones involved. Among those kinds, ***aññamañña*** varies three kinds, 

(i)  **four mental aggregates** mutually benefit each other,  (ii)  **four great elements** mutually benefit each other, 

(iii)  **mentality and corporeality** benefit mentality and corporeality at the 

moment of process of NONE in five-groups-existence, respectively. 

**PAGE-424** 

When **corporeality benefits corporeality** (four great elements mutually benefit each other),  the  commentary  explained  that  it benefits by  means  of  **all  corporeal  conitinuity *(sabba santati vasena).* (Abhi.A.lll.3S3)** 

Then the second group, ***na aññamañña,*** also varies three kinds, 

(i)  **mentality benefits corporeality** = (10) kinds of two-fivefold-consciousness, those  mental  ***dhammas***  of  five-groups  existence,  excluding  death- consciousness of arahant benefit CPM 

(ii)  **corporeality  benefits  corporeality  =**  four  great  elements  benefit  derived 

corporealities** within same corporeal unit 

(iii)  **corporeality  benefits  mentality**  =  eye-base  benefits  seeing-consciousness-

element  and  associating  mental  ***dhammas**'*  visible  object  benefits  seeing- consciousness element and associating mental ***dhammas**,* respectively. 

By means of relation of presence *(**atthi**-**paccaya**),* causal ***dhammas*** benefit resultant ***dhammas*** in this preaching as ***vatthu** **purejātatthi, ārammaņa purejātatthi. (Abhi.A.III.383, 384)*** 

"When  **corporeality  benefits  corporeality**  (=  four  great  elements benefit  derived corporealities within same corporeal unit), it benefits by means of **all corporeal continuity *(sabba santati vasena)",*** explained in the commentary. *(**Abhi.A.III.384**)* 

4) ***pacchājātatthi*** 

In five-groups-existence, those causal ***dhammas***, (85) kinds of consciousness and (52) kinds of mental concomitants which are succeeding wholesome, unwholesome, consequent, indifferent ones, the first life-continuum etc,  excluding four consequent consciousness of immaterial  sphere,  benefit  resultant  ***dhammas***  called  great  elements  and  derived corporealities  which  are  reaching  into  static  stage  of  corporeality  and  are  known  as ***tisamuṭṭhānikakāya** (=* corporealities produced by threefold causes) ***catu samutthānika** **kāya*** (= corporealities produced by fourfold causes) by means of the __relation of post-compatible presence *(pacchājātatthi paccay a).*__ *(__Abhi.A.III.384, 385__*) 

5) ***āhāratthi (=* nutrimental presence)** 

***kabaļīkāro āhāro imassa kāyassa atthipaccayenapaccayo. (Paṭṭhāna.1.6)*** 

**Physical nutriment,** various nutriments produced by four-fold causes, ***kamma**,* mind, temperature, nutriment, which are consisting in various corporeal units benefit all kinds of corporeal ***dhammas*** produced by four-fold causes, which are consisting in same or different corporeal units by means of the **relation of nutritional presence *(aharatthi paccay a).*** (See Section 4, Volume I, ***rūpa** **kammaṭṭhāna**)* 

***idhapanesa  attano  aniruddhakkhaņe  paccayabhāvena  atthipaccayoti  vutto. (Abhi.A.llI.385)*** 
PAGE25

In  this  section  of  the  **relation  of  presence,**  ***pañhāvāra**,*  the  Buddha  preached  on nutritional presence due to presence of capability to benefit all kinds of corporeal ***dhammas*** produced by four-fold causes which are consisting in same or different corporeal units before ***kabaļīkāra** **āhāra ojā*** perish away. 

**PAGE-425** 

6) ***indriyatthi =* physical vitality presence** 

***rūpajīvitindriyam kaṭattārūpānam atthipaccayenapaccayo. (Paṭṭhāna.1.162)*** 

***iddha  panetampi  attano  aniruddhakkhaņeyeva  paccayabhāvena  atthipaccayoti vuttam. (Abhi.A.lII.385)*** 

Physical vital faculty within corporeal unit produced by ***kamma*** benefits remaining CPK  by  means  of  the  **relation  of  physical  vital  faculty  presence  *(rūpa  jīvitindriya paccaya).*** It means that it is responsible for protection of CPK within same corporeal unit. In this section of ***pañhāvāra**,* the Buddha preached on the relation of physical vital faculty as the **relation of presence** due to presence of capability to benefit **CPK** within same corporeal unit before vital faculty itself perish away. *(**Abhi.A3.385**)* 

**The relation of mental presence - The relation of physical presence** 

Those kinds of relations of presence in which mental ***dhammas*** perform the function of the relation of presence are belongs to \_\_ 

1) compatible presence *(**sahajātatthi**)* 
1) post  compatible  presence  *(**pacchdjatatthi**)* appropriately.  Those  relations  of  presence concerned with corporeality are — 
1) compatible presence *(**sahajātatthi**)* 
1) pre-compatible presence *(**purejātatthi**)* 
1) nutritional presence *(**āhāratthi**)* 
1) physical vital faculty presence *(**indriyatthi**).* 

**In** ***Abhidhammatthasańgaha*** (Compendium of Philosophy), it shows five kinds of relations  of  presence,  **to**  wit,  ***sahajātatthi**,  **purejātatthi,  kabaļīkārāhāratthi**, **rūpajīvitindriyatthi**.* 

In  this  paper,  according  to  the  following  explanation  of  commentary,  ***sahajāta purejātatthi*** is added resulting in presenting as 6 kinds. 

***yam  rūpam  nissayāti  ettha  sahajātapurejātavasena  atthipaccayo  niddittho. (Abhi.A.III.383)*** 

That ***sahajāta purejātatthi*** also belongs to ***sahajātatthi*** and ***purejātatthi*** appropriately and it should be recognized on 5 kinds of relations of presence. 

In brief, this relation is a kind of relation in which

Both causal and resultant ***dhammas*** are present ***dhammas*** occurring in three-time- phases, ***uppāda**-**ṭhiti**-**bhańga**.*

22. ***natthi paccaya* (the relation of absence)** 

_**attano**  **anantaram  uppajjamānānam  arūpadhammānam pavattiokāsassa  dādnena upakārakā  samanantaraniruddhā  arūpadhammā  natthipaccayo.  (Abhi.A.III.352,**_ **_Vs.II.172_)** 

***samanantaraniruddhā   cittacetasikādhammā   paṭuppannānam   cittacetasikānam   dhammānam natthipaccayena paccayo. (Paṭṭhāna.*1.9)** 

Mental ***dhammas**,* which are capable of benefiting by giving opportunity to occur contiguous mental ***dhammas**,* which have been ceased contiguously, are called the **relation of absence *(natthi paccaya).*** 

Causal ***dhammas**,* (89) kinds of preceding consciousness and (52) kinds of mental concomitants,  excluding  death-consciousness  of  Arahants,  which  have  been  ceased contiguously  benefit  succeeding  (89)  kinds  of  consciousness  and  (52)  kinds  of  mental concomitants,  including  death  consciousness  of  Arahants  by  means  of  the  **relation  of absence.** *(**Paṭṭhāna.l.9, Abhi.A.III.352, Vs.II.172***) 

**Regular phenomenon of mental *dhamma*** 

Within  one  mind  moment  called  three-time-phases,  ***uppāda***  (arising  stage),  ***ṭhiti*** (static**  stag**e),**  ***bhańga***  (perishing  stage),  synchronous  arising  of  two  or  three  kinds  of consciousness  never  occur**  as**  regular**-**phenomenon  of  mental  ***dhamma**.*  It  is  regular phenomenon of mental ***dhamma*** by which respective mental concomitants are associating with each consciousness but not many kinds of contact *(**phassa**),*** feeling** *(**vedanā**).* One mind moment consists of one kind of consciousness, .one kind of contact, one kind of perception *(**saññā**),*  one  kind  of  volition  *(**cetanā**)*  etc  as  natural  fixed  law.  While  all  kinds  of consciousness and mental concomitants, which are deserving to occur as associating causal and  resultant  ***dhammas***  are  present,  another  all  kinds  of  consciousness  and  mental concomitants are unable to occur simultaneously. However, after mental ***dhammas**,* which are consisting in one kind of mind moment ceased, contiguous mental ***dhammas*** as second mind  moment  arise.  Therefore,  the  occurrence  of  capable  of  benefiting  of  all  mental ***dhammas*** consisting in previous mind moment by means of absence, is called the **relation of absence *(natthi paccaya).*** 

Although  absence  of  more  previously  occurred  consciousness  are  present,  those consciousness are unable to benefit by means of the relation of absence. Actually, preceding consciousness which is  adjacent to succeeding  consciousness, is capable of benefiting to resultant ***dhamma**,* the succeeding one which is impossible to arise due to presence of it, by means  of  absence  of  causal  ***dhammas***  "as  giving  opportunity  to  occur".  Therefore,  the commentator  expounded  that  "which  are  capable  of  benefiting  by  giving  opportunity  to occur". *(**Mūlaṭī.III.175**)* 

In this case, although causal ***dhammas*** have "no inner desire to give opportunity to occur" in that way, it should be recognized the fact that the word, "as giving opportunity to 
PAGE27

occur,'  is  a  metaphorical  usage  called ***taddhammūpacāra*** by  which  causal ***dhammas***  are intended to be said as having "inner desire to give opportunity to occur". *(**Anuṭī.III.238**)* 

This is a kind of relation in which mental it benefits mentality. 

Causal  ***dhammas***  are  past  ***dhammas***  while  resultant  ***dhammas***  are  momentary  present ***dhammas*** which are reaching in three-time-phases, ***uppāda**-**ṭhiti**-**bhańga**.* 

**PAGE-427** 

23. ***vigata paccaya* (the relation of disappearance)** 

Those contiguous ***dhammas**,* which had been ceased are capable of benefiting for adjacent  mental  ***dhammas***  by  means  of  disappearance  resulting  in  giving  opportunity  to occur, are called the **relation of disappearance.** *(**Abhi.A.III.352**)* 

***samanantaravigatā   cittacetasikā   dhammā   paṭuppannānam   cittacetasikānam   dhammānam vigatapaccayena paccayo. (Paṭṭhāna.1.9)*** 

Causal  ***dhammas**,*  called  (89)  kinds  of  preceding  consciousness  and  (52)  mental concomitants,  excluding  death-consciousness  of  Arahant,  which  are  contiguous  and disappearing ones benefit resultant ***dhammas**,* called (89) kinds of succeeding consciousness and  (52)  mental  concomitants,  including  death  consciousness  of  Arahant  by  means  of **relation of disappearance.** 

This is a kind of relation in which mentality benefits mentality. 

Causal ***dhammas*** are past ***dhammas*** in accordance with explanation, ***samanantara vigata.*** Resultant ***dhammas*** are present ***dhammas*** which are existing in three-time-phases, ***uppāda**-**ṭhiti**-**bhańga*** in accordance with the explanation of commentary, ***"paṭuppannananti paccuppannānam".** (**Abhi.A.rn.386**)* 

These **relation of absence and disappearance** are the nature of absence and lacking of preceding consciousness and mental concomitants which are causal ***dhammas**.* That kind of absence and lacking is a causality of opportunity to occur succeeding consciousness and mental concomitants. That causality is designated as ***natthi paccaya, vigata paccaya*** in ***Pāli*** usage. It should be recognized that "as if one person reaches at the top, the other one who had reached top will be fallen as natural fixed law". 

24. ***avigata paccaya* (the relation of non-disappearance)** 

It should be recognized that those ***dhammas*** concerning to the relation of presence, are also the relation of non-disappearance due to capability to benefit respective resultant ***dhammas*** by means of occurrence of non-disappearing. (It means obvious presence is called non-disappearance  without  ceasing  yet.  It  is  identical  to  the  relation  of  presence.) *(**Abhi.A.III.352**)* 

Due  to  presence  of  Knowledge  of  Omniscience  *(**sabbaññuta  ññāņ**)*  which  is  the cause  of  adornment  of  preaching  methodology  and  due  to  presence  of  inner  desire  of disciples who are deserving to admonish and release from rounds of rebirth by means of those kinds of relations of disappearance and non-disappearance, the Buddha preached again on these two kinds of relations although these relations are basically identical with relations of absence and presence. It should be recognized similar to the fact that the Buddha preached ***hetu sampayutta duka*** again although ***sahetuka duka*** had been preached. *(**Abhi.A.III..352, Vs.II.174***)

1. ***natthi-vigata, atthi-avigata*** 

There is a reasonable question that whether ***natthibhāva*** (= the occurrence of absence) and ***vigatabhava*** (= the occurrence of disappearance) are the same each other and how are significant  features  between  them.  The  answer  is  that  —  although  ***natthibhāva***  and ***vigatabhāva***  are  similar  in  lacking,  due  to  presence  of  it,  it  is  unopportunity  to  occur succeeding consciousness and then the process of giving an opportunity to occur resultant ***dhammas*** by means of absence is the occurrence of ***natthi** **paccaya**.* Due to presence **of inability**  to  occur  succeeding  natural  ***dhammas***  unless  natural  ***dhammas***  called  causal ***dhammas*** of themselves **are** disappearing and then the process of capable of benefiting on resultant  ***dhammas***  by  means  of  disappearing,  is  the  occurrence  of  ***vigata  paccaya.** (**Mūlaṭī**.**III.l75**)* 

**PAGE-428** 

***natthita ca nirodhānantarasuññatā, vigatatā nirodhappattatā. (Mūlaṭī.III.175)*** 

***abhāvamattenati  hutvā  abhāvamattena.  pa  .  sabhāvavigamenati  etena  nirodhato parampi yato "vigatata nirodhappattata" ti vuttam. (Anuṭī.III.238)*** 

The occurrence of nothingness without any remains relating to those causal ***dhammas*** just after those causal ***dhammas*** ceased, is the occurrence of ***natthi paccaya,*** indeed. The occurrence of causal ***dhammas*** which had been reached to cessation, is the occurrence of ***vigata paccaya.*** These are significance of those relations. The nature of ***natthi*** is apparent at the moment of perishing stage *(**bhańga** **khaņa**)* while the nature** of ***vigata*** is apparent after cessation occurred. 

***atthi-avigata** —* The occurrence of capable of benefiting by means of presence of each  specific  character  of  causal  ***dhammas***  is  the  occurrence  of  ***atthi  paccaya.***  The occurrence of capable of benefiting by means of non-reaching to cessation due to presence of non-disappearance of respective specific character of causal ***dhammas**,* is the occurrence of ***avigata paccaya.** (**Mūlaṭī**.**III.175**)* 

Obvious presence of causal ***dhammas*** is ***atthi*** indeed. Non-reaching to cessation of causal ***dhammas*** is ***avigata,*** indeed. *(**Anuṭī.III.239**)* 

2. **Hexad relations** 

These (24) kinds of relations can be divided into six groups according to nature, 

1. six  kinds  of  relations  in  which  **mentality  benefits  mentality,**  to  wit,  ***anantara**, **samanantara**, **asevana, sampayutta, natthi, vigata**.* 
1. five kinds of relations in which **mentality benefits mentality and corporeality,** to wit, ***hetu**, **jhāna**, **magga**, **kamma**, **vipāka**.* 
1. one kind of relation in which **mentality benefits corporeality** , to wit, ***pacchājāta**.* 
1. one kind of relation in which **corporeality benefits mentality,** to wit, ***purejāta**.* 
1. two  kinds  of  relations  in  which  concept  and  **mentality  and  corporeality  benefit mentality,** to wit, ***ārammaņa**, **upanissaya**.* 
1. nine  kinds  of  relations  in  which  mentality  and  corporeality  benefit  mentality  and corporeality,  to  wit*,  **adhipati,  sahajāta,  aññamañña,  nissaya,  āhāra,  indriya, vipayutta, atthi, avigata***.

**PAGE-429** 

3. **Way of grouping by means of *dhamma*** 
1. The relation of root is concerning to six kinds of roots *(**hetu**')* and then it is a partial of mentality, indeed. 
1. The relation of object is concerning **to concept and all kinds of mentalities and corporealities.** (Mentality consists of ***nibbāna**)* 
1. In  the  relation  of  predominance,  causal  ***dhammas***  of  the  relation  of  compatible predominance concerned with a partial of mentality. 
1. Those relations of ***kamma**-**magga**-**jhāna*** are partial of mentality. 
1. The relation of objective predominance concerned with all kinds of objects which are deserving **to** respect. 
1. Those  relations  of  ***anantara**,  **samanantara**,  **pacchājāta,  asevana,  vipāka, sampayutta, natthi, vigata*** are mental ***dhammas*** only. 
1. ***Nibbāna*** should be designated as a **partial of mental *dhammas* due to occurrence of non-concerning to** causal ***dhammas**, **anantara*** etc. 
1. The relation of precompatibility is a partial of corporeality. 
1. Those remaining relations are mentality and corporeality relating to causal ***dhammas*** which are deserving ones. *(**Abhi.A.III.352**)* 
4. **Way of grouping by means of time** 
1. These  (15)  kinds  of  relations,  viz.,  ***hetu**,  **sahajāta**,  **aññamañña,  nissaya,  purejāta, pacchājāta,  vipāka,  āhāra,  indriya,  jhāna,  magga,  sampayutta,  vippayutta,  atthi, avigata**,* are present ***dhammas*** only. 
1. These (5) kinds of relations, viz., ***anantara**, **samanantara**, **āsevana**, **natthi**, **vigata**,* are past ***dhammas*** only. 
1. The relation of ***kamma*** occurs depending upon both two periods called present and past. (It means that ***sahajāta** **kamma*** is present ***dhamma*** while ***nānākkhaņika** **kamma*** is past ***dhamma**.)* 
1. Those  remaining  three  kinds  of  relations,  **viz.,**  ***ārammaņa**,  **adhipati**,  **upanissaya**,*  are yoking with three kinds of periods, past, present and future. It should be recognized that they are also free from time *(**kāla vimutta**)* because concept and ***nibbāna*** are designated as causal ***dhammas**. (**Abhi.A.III.353**)* 
5. **Way of grouping by means of resultant *dhamma*** 
1. Those  relations,  ***ārammaņa**,  **anantara**,  **samanantara**,  **upanissaya**,  **purejāta,  āsevana, sampayutta, natthi**, **vigata*** benefit only mental ***dhammas*** as resultant ***dhamma**.* 
1. The relation of ***pacchājāta*** benefit only corporeal ***dhammas*** as resultant ***dhammas**.* 
1. Those  remaining  (14)  kinds  of  relations  benefit  both  two  kinds  of  mentality  and corporeality as resultant ***dhammas**. (**Mahāṭī.II.288**)* 
6. **Way** of grouping **by** means of ***janaka**, **upatthambhaka***

1. Those  kinds  of  relations,  viz.,  ***anantara**,  **samanantara**,  **anantarūpanissaya**, **pakatūpanissaya**,  **āsevana,  nānākhanika-kamma,  natthi,  vigata***  are  causal ***dhammas*** of ***janaka*** which are able to give rise to resultant ***dhammas*** directly but not ***upatthambhaka*** ones which are able to support indirectly. 

**PAGE-430** 

2. The relation of ***pacchājāta*** is only a causal ***dhamma*** of ***upatthambhaka*** which is able to support but not ***janaka*** one. 
2. Those remaining kinds of relations are not only causal ***dhammas*** of ***janaka*** which are able to give rise to resultant ***dhammas*** directly but also ***upatthambhaka*** ones which are able to support, maintain and to be strong. (***Mūlaṭī.II.288, 289***) 
7. **Summary of (24) kinds of relations** 

***ārammaņūpanissayakammatthipaccayesu   ca   sabbe  pi  paccayā   samodhānam  gicchanti. (Abhidhammatthasańgaha)*** 

If those (24) kinds of relations are admitted appropriately, they belong in four kinds of relations, viz., ***ārammaņa**, **upanissaya**, **kamma**, **atthi**.* 

1. ***ārammaņa  paccaya**  —*  These  two  kinds  of  relations,  ***ārammaņadhipati***  and ***ārammaņupanissaya*** belong in the relation of object. Those are two kinds of relations which benefit resultant ***dhammas*** by standing as cognizable objects. 
1. ***upanissaya  paccaya**  —*  These  six  kinds  of  relations,  ***anantara**,  **samanantara**, **anantarūpanissaya**,  **āsevana**,  **natthi**,  **vigata**,*  belong  in  the  relation  of  determinative dependence *(**upanissaya** **paccaya**).* Causal ***dhammas*** occur within preceding mind moment while  resultant  ***dhammas***  occur  within  succeeding  mind  moment.  Only  when  causality ceased, the result can rise. 
1. ***kamma** **paccaya** —* These two kinds of relations, ***pakatūpanissaya**, **nānākhanika** **kamma**,* belong in the relation of ***kamma**.* Causality and results can be separated by many cognitive processes, many lives or many world times. 
1. ***atthi paccaya** —* Those (16) kinds of relations which are relating to ***sahajāta**,* to wit, ***sahajātadhipati**, **sahajāta**, **aññamañña**, **sahajāta** **nissaya**, **sahajāta** **kamma**, **vipāka**,* mental nutriments,  ***sahajātindriya,  rūpajīvitindriya,  jhāna,  magga,  sampayutta,  sahajāta vippayutta, sahajātatthi, sahajāta avigata**;* those (7) kinds of relations which are relating to ***purejāta**,*  to  wit,  ***purejāta**,  **purejāta**  **nissaya**,  **purejātindriya,  purejāta  vippayutta, purejātatthi, purejāta avigata**,* physical nutriment; and those (5) kinds of relations which are relating  to  ***pacchājādta**,*  to  wit,  ***pacchājāta,  pacchājāta  vippayutta,  pacchājātatthi, pacchājāta avigata**,* physical nutriment, belong in the relation of presence *(**atthi** **paccaya**).* During both causal and resultant ***dhammas*** are still present obviously, those relations can benefit resultant ***dhammas**.* 

Here, explanation on (24) kinds of relations has been finished. It will be continued to present  how  conditional  relations  *(**Paṭṭhāna**)*  concern  with  the  doctrine  of  Dependent- Origination *(**paṭiccasamuppāda**).*

* ***paccayo hoti puññānam, duvidhānekadhā pana.*** 

`  `***paresam pacchimānam sā, ekadhā paccayo matā. (Abhi-A-2-139)*** 

1. Ignorance benefits for arising of wholesome formations by means of efficiency of two kinds  of  relations,  viz.,  object  relation  (***ārammaņa  paccaya***)  and  determinative dependence relation (***upanissaya paccaya***). 
1. Ignorance  benefits  for  arising  of  unwholesome  formations  by  means  of  efficiency  of numerous kinds of relations. 
1. Ignorance  benefits  for  arising  of  unwholesome  formations  (***āneñjābhi  sańkhāra***)  by means of efficiency of only one kind of relation called determinative dependence.  (***Abhi- A-2-139***). 
1. ***puññābhi sańkhāra* (wholesome formation)** 
* ***tathā  avijjāsammuļhattā  kāmabhavarūpabhavasampattiyo  patthetvā  tāneva*** 

***puññānikarontassa. (Abhi-A-2-139, Vs-2-173)*** 

- Due to present of strong bewilderment with ignorance, in the continuum of the 

person  who  cultivates  those  sensual  and  fine-material  wholesome  formations  through heartfelt  desire  on  attainment  of  sensual  and  fine-material  coming-into-existences  the ignorance benefits for arising of those two kinds of formations by means of efficiency of relation of determinative dependence (***upanissaya paccaya***). (***Abhi-A-2-139***) 

Before (24) kinds of relations are to be explicit the righteous reader should like to recognize any one kind of previous examples which have been mentioned again. 

For  instance\_\_\_\_\_  Observance  of  eight  or  more  Buddhist  precepts  (=sensual wholesome formations) were cultivated with the purpose of attainment of woman’s life who can serve satisfactorily parents. That  man who  had no opportunity to serve satisfactorily parents has got woman’s existence in present life due to those wholesome formations. 

In this example, the nature of wrong knowing as woman is the ignorance, (***avijjā***) indeed. The nature of heartfelt desire to that woman’s existence is the craving called ***taņhā*** while the nature of strong attachment on that existence is the clinging called ***upādāna***. Due to presence of strong bewilderment with that kind of ignorance, sensual wholesome formations called  moral  wholesome  deeds  were  cultivated.  The  ignorance,  wrong  knowing  as  that woman, benefits for arising of those wholesome formations of by means of efficiency of relation of determinative dependence. 

If the ignorance called wrong knowing as woman is absent, the sensual wholesome formation called observance of Buddhist precepts would not be cultivated with the purpose to attain that woman’s existence. Because the ignorance called wrong knowing as woman who has opportunity to serve satisfactorily parents was present apparently heartfelt desire to that woman’s  existence  arises  in  him  really,  resulting  in  cultivating  moral  deeds,  sensual wholesome formations. The ignorance, therefore, is a relation of determinative dependence for arising of formations.

2. **Way of discerning** 

Translated by - ***Aññatara Bhikkhu*** \*  PAGE34

The  righteous  ***meditator***  must  scrutinize  ignorance,  craving,  clinging,  formations, action by following above example. Among those, ignorance-craving-clinging are defilement round while formations-action are action around. Both ***dhammas*** are mind-door-cognitive processes only. By seeing how mental ***dhammas*** of mind-door-cognitive process belonging to  action  round  arise  depending  upon  mental  ***dhammas***  of  mind-door  cognitive  process belonging to defilement round. The righteous ***meditator*** must discern as……. 

“due to arising of ignorance, formations arises”; the ignorance is causal ***dhamma*** ; the formations are resultant ***dhammas***”. 

Those mind-door-cognitive processes of both defilement round and action round can be  arise  in  numerous  times.  Those  mind-door-cognitive process  of  defilement  round  and action round can be separated by numerous cognitive process. In this case, it can be said that ignorance benefits those wholesome formations by means of efficiency of relation of natural determinative dependence (***pakatūpanissaya paccaya***) because moral deeds called sensual wholesome formations were cultivates by depending upon ignorance belonging to defilement round. The ***meditator*** should discern carefully by insight knowledge. 

The next example \_\_\_\_\_ A practising ***meditator*** who had heartfelt desire to ***brahmas***’ existence  practiced  meditation  on  bone  under  instruction  of  his  teacher  in  one  kind  of previous lives during the period, out of the admonishment of Supreme Buddha. He had got the first absorption through bone object. Then he developed that first absorption in order to become superior one, resulting in reaching into great ***brahma***’s realm (***mahābrahma***). 

In  this  example,  due  to  presence  of  ignorance-  craving  called  wrong  knowing  as ***brahma***,  heartfelt  desire  to  that  ***brahma***’s  life,  strong  obsession  on  that  life,  that  first absorption of fine material sphere called wholesome formations had been cultivated through ***meditatior*** on bone. Due to that wholesome formations he had reached into great ***brahma***’s realm. That ignorance benefits for arising of those fine-material wholesome formations by means of efficiency of relation of natural determinative dependence. 

**PAGE-433** 

The next example\_\_\_\_\_ A  practising ***meditator*** who renounced during the period, out of admonishment  of  the  supreme  Buddha  developed  the  first  absorption  of  fire-***kasiņa*** (***tejokasiņa***). Then he developed that  first absorption in order to become  middle  kind of absorption (***majjhimajhāna***), resulting in reaching into ***brahmaparohitā*** realm after death. In this case, due to presence of efficiency of relation of natural determinative dependence of ignorance ( craving-clinging) which is the nature of strong bewilderment to attainment of ***brahma***’s  life  ,  the  first  absorption  of  fire-***kasiņa***  of  wholesome  formation  had  been cultivated satisfactorily. 

If the righteous person cultivates charity , morality, ***samatha*** and ***vipassanā*** practices or  absorptions  of  fine-material  sphere  with  the  purpose  of  overcoming  ignorance,  that ignorance  benefits  those  sensual  and  fine-material  wholesome  formations  by  means  of  efficiency of relation of natural determinative dependence. It is similar to kind of cultivating wholesome formations in a way that during performing wholesome deeds the strong wish, “***idam me puññam āsavakkhayam vaham hotu*** = may this merit be achieve the Noble Path of Arahant which eradicates four taints ***dhammas***”, is always performed. If the righteous person had experienced ***vipassanā***  practice by which ignorance (= continuity of mind- door- cognitive processes of defilement round) was discerned as ***anicca*** etc, through the nature of destruction-perishing away (***khaya-vaya***) in his previous life\_\_\_\_\_.

The ignorance which was discerned object of that ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge benefited sensual  wholesome  formations  with  predominating  ***Vipassanā***   Knowledge  by  means  of efficiency of relation of object ( ***ārammaņa*** ***paccaya***). Only when ignorance can be taken as object  ***vipassanā***  practice  can  be  performed  by  penetrative  knowing  on  the  nature  of destruction-perishing  away  of  ignorance.  Unless  ignorance  is  taken  as  object  or  unless ignorance is known penetratively though it can be taken as object, it is impossible to arise ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge by taking the object of destruction-perishing away of that ignorance. It can, therefore, be said that ignorance benefits for arising of sensual wholesome formations with predominating ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge by means of efficiency of relation of object. 

If that righteous person has got various  

Super-psychic  Knowledge  (***abhiññāņa***)  either  in  the  previous  life  or  present  life;  if  the consciousness  with  delusion  (***samoha  citta***)  occurring  in  past,  future,  present,  internal, external can be known and seen penetratively up to ultimate nature with the help of various Super-psychic  Knowledge  called  ***cetopariyañāņa***  (distinguishable  knowledge  on  other’s mind),  ***pubbenivāsañāņa***  (knowing  previous  lives),  ***anāgatamsañāņa***  (distinguishable knowledge on future); that ignorance benefits for arising of those fine-material wholesome formations by means of efficiency of relation of object. (***Abhi-A-2-139, Vs-2-173***) 

**PAGE-434** 

3. ***āneñjābhisańkhāra* (unshakable wholesome formations)** 

If  the righteous person had experienced various absorptions of immaterial sphere with the purpose of attainment of ***brahma***s of immaterial sphere in any kind of previous lives; if absorptions of immaterial sphere were also achieved and experienced to reach those kinds of  immaterial sphere; the ignorance which is wrong knowing as ***brahma***’s life in immaterial sphere benefited unshakable wholesome formations called those absorptions of immaterial sphere by means of efficiency of relation of natural determinative dependence. 

To be noticed \_\_\_\_\_ The opinion of this paper is that \_\_\_\_\_ if those fine-material and immaterial wholesome formations can not be found within four or five previous lives during scrutinizing  successive  causal  and  resultant  ***dhammas***  of  previous  lives  by  sending knowledge, it is not essential to scrutinize emphatically on those ***dhammas***. This is because in the aspect of range of disciple’s perfection of knowledge, this knowledge of cause and condition (***paccaya pariggaha ñāņa***) can be fulfilled after knowing  on partial range of action and  consequence  of  action  (***kamma-kammavipāka***)  only.  (***Vs-2-237,  Mahāṭi-2-380***). However the righteous person should like to keep in mind successive causal and resultant ***dhammas*** of previous lives until those periods cultivating with fertile seeds of knowledge (***vijja***) and fertile seeds of practice (***caraņa***) .If does not mean that only when one keeps in mind in that way can he attain the Noble Path-Knowledge, Fruit-Knowledge and ***nibbāna***, but for thorough understanding on efficiency of fertile seeds of perfections (***paramita***) and  to be inspired with imaginative ideas only. 

4. ***appuññābhi sańkhāra* (unwholesome formations)** 

During  keeping in mind successive causal and resultant ***dhammas*** of previous lives, if the righteous person knows and sees those defilement ***dhammas*** , i.e., selfish desire, wrong view, skeptical doubt (***vicikicchā***), distraction (***uddhacca***), grief (***domanassa***) through taking the object of ignorance, he must continue to discern how that ignorance benefited for arising of those unwholesome formations called defilement ***dhammas***, selfish desire etc. (***Abhi-A-2- 139***) 

Translated by - ***Aññatara Bhikkhu*** \*  PAGE36

Because  those  unwholesome  formations,  selfish  desire  etc,  are  always  associating with ignorance, how unwholesome formations, selfish desire etc; has to be known by taking the object of ignorance as object during pleasing with selfish desire etc. (***Mūlaṭī-2-289***) 

For instance \_\_\_\_\_ Let us suppose a righteous person is full of satisfaction by seeing his own piles of gold. The nature of wrong knowing as gold, the ignorance, associates with that selfish desire ***dhamma*** really. Then if succeeding selfish desire  arises by taking the object of selfish desire on piles of gold, it can be said succeeding satisfaction again by taking the object of selfish desire of  previous situation is the same as the satisfaction again by taking the object of ignorance because preceding selfish desire associates with ignorance. Depending  upon  very  strong bewilderment  called  wrong  knowing  as  gold,  strong  selfish desires “my gold, my gold”, arises. Depending upon strong selfish desire as “my gold, my gold”, succeeding strong selfish desire as “my gold, my gold “, arise over and over again. 

The nature of wrong knowing as “mine”; “gold”, the ignorance, always associates with  those  selfish  desire  ***dhammas***.  It  can,  therefore,  be  said  that  ignorance  benefits  for arising of defilements, selfish desire  etc, by  means of efficiency of  relation of object.  It should be understood similarly how remaining defilements, wrong view, skeptical doubts, distraction, grief etc, arise by taking the object of ignorance. 

**PAGE-435** 

***Pali Quotation (Paṭṭhāna-1-134)*** 

- Unwholesome deed is pleasurable and satisfied. Selfish desire arises by taking that object of unwholesome deed, resulting in arising of wrong view, skeptical doubt, distraction, grief, when  unwholesome  deed  ceases,  consequence  registering  consciousness  (***vipāka tadārammaņa***) arises. (***Paṭṭhāna-1-134***) 

The nature of worldling persons, indeed is usually pleasing and satisfying on their lives by themselves. They never finish to follow various fashionable objects. They are never tired of heartfelt desiring on various kind of both living and non-living sensual desirable objects. They usually see their banker’s card (cheque card) over and over again. They are never wearisome to carry and cuddle their grand children. It is proliferation of succeeding selfish desire based on proceeding selfish desire indeed. Both preceding and succeeding kinds of selfish desire always associates with the nature of wrong knowing called ignorance really. Thus during arising out Thus during arising of heartfelt desire on preceding heartfelt desire the heartfelt desire on ignorance that associates with preceding one also includes inevitably. Ignorance can, therefore, benefit unwholesome formations by means of efficiency of relation of object. 

***Pali Quotation (Paṭṭhāna-1-137-147)*** 

Selfish desire is respectfully pleasurable and satisfied. Selfish desire arises by taking that object of Selfish desire, resulting in arising of wrong view. Wrong view is respectfully pleasurable and satisfied. Selfish desires arise by respectful taking that object of wrong view, resulting in arising of wrong view again. (***Paṭṭhāna-137,147***) 

During arising of ignorance selfish desire and wrong view can or can not associate with it. Selfish desire can associate the consciousness with rooted in greed. Selfish desire and wrong view can associate the consciousness with wrong view  (***diṭṭhigata sampayutta citta***), but not those consciousness with rooted in anger (***dosmūla citta***) and consciousness with rooted in delusion (***mohamūla citta***). The ignorance, actually always associates with all kinds of  unwholesome  consciousness.  Whether  ignorance  and  selfish  desire,  wrong  view  are 
PAGE35

associating within one mind moment or not (= whether they are occurring in separate mind moments ) it is intended to be said the arising of unwholesome formations, selfish desire, wrong view etc, only by taking the object of ignorance consisting in preceding cognitive process. 

***\*asahajātassa upanissayādinā sańkhārassa avijjā paccayo hoti. (Anuṭī-2-107)*** 

The ignorance which is not compatibility within one mind moment benefits for arising of formations by efficiency of relation of determinative dependence. ***(Anuṭī-2-107)*** 

* ***garum katvā assādanakāle ārāmmaņā-dhipati ārammanūpanissaye hi. (Abhi-A-2-139, Vs-2-173)*** 

The  ignorance  which  can be benefit by  means  of  efficiency  of  relation  of  object ordinarily, actually, is not succeeding compatible ignorance which associates with selfish desire, wrong view but is only preceding ignorance which can be either associating with or not associating with selfish desire, wrong view. 

**PAGE-436** 

This  ignorance  which  is  causal  ***dhamma***  of  the  relation  of  object  predominance (***ārāmmaņā-dhipati***)  and  the  relation  of  object  determinative  dependence (***ārāmmanupaņissaya***), is only ignorance associating with selfish desire-wrong view. In the aspect of causal ignorance, it is associating with selfish desire-wrong view. In the aspect of resultant  selfish  desire-wrong  view,  these  are  also  associating  with  ignorance.  However causal ***dhammas*** are preceding mind-door cognitive processes while resultant ***dhammas*** are succeeding mind-door cognitive processes. Impulsions of  both sides belong to greed wrong view group. The nature of wrong knowing as man, woman, person, being, human being, heavenly  being,  ***brahma***  etc,  is  ignorance  indeed.  In  this  section  of  relation  of  object predominance and object determinative dependence that ignorance always associates with selfish desire-wrong view only. 

***\*garum katvā assādanam rāga diṭṭhisampayuttāya eva avijjāya yojetabbam. (Mūlaṭī-2-99, Mahāṭī-2-289)*** 

The nature of heartfelt desire on any king of coming-into-existences called those man, woman,  person,  human  being,  heavenly  being,  ***brahma***  etc,  is  ***taņhā***  (=  ***rāga***)  (craving) indeed.  The  nature  of  wrong  belief  in  a  way  that  man,  woman,  person,  human  being, heavenly being, ***brahma*** etc, are present really, is ***diṭṭhi*** (wrong view). It is a kind of nature which always associates with selfish desire (***rāga***). 

If  the  selfish  desire  on  any  kind  of  coming-into-existence,  man,  woman,  person, being, human being , heavenly being, ***brahma*** etc, is respectfully satisfied, the heartfelt desire on ignorance which is associating with that selfish desire is also inclusive. Thus if preceding selfish desire, in the next method, those preceding selfish desire together with ignorance are respectfully satisfied, succeeding selfish desire arises; wrong view arise consequently. Those preceding  selfish  desire  together  with  ignorance  benefit  for  arising  of  succeeding  selfish desire-wrong view by  means of efficiency of relation of object predominance and object determinative dependence. In other words\_\_\_\_\_ 

Preceding  impulsions  of  mind-door  cognitive  processes  associating  with  selfish desire-wrong view-ignorance benefit for arising of succeeding continuity of impulsions of mind-door cognitive process associating with selfish desire-wrong view-ignorance by means 

Translated by - ***Aññatara Bhikkhu*** \*  PAGE38

of efficiency  of relation of object predominance and object determinative dependence. This kind  of  relation  can  be  said  ignorance  benefits  unwholesome  formations  (***apuññābhi sańkhāra***)  by  means  of  efficiency  of  relation  of  object  predominance  and  object determinative dependence. 

In the continuum of a person who commits unwholesome deeds, killing being etc., due  to  presence  of  strong  bewilderment  with  ignorance  which  is  capable  of  concealing disadvantage of coming-into-existence; who is unable to see disadvantages of unwholesome deeds due to lack of discerning on those advantages; that ignorance benefits unwholesome formations which are origin of committing unwholesome deeds by means of efficiency of relation of natural determinative dependence (***pakatūpa nissaya paccaya satti***). Ignorance benefits all kinds of unwholesome ***dhammas*** which are origin of committing all kinds of  immoral conducts, killing being, stealing etc, by means of efficiency of natural determinative dependence. (***Paṭṭhāna-1-148; Abhi-A-2-139***). Furthermore while unwholesome formations are occurring depending upon that ignorance, every kind of unwholesome formation also consists of ignorance (= delusion) and then among those kinds of ignorance the ignorance which is associating with preceding impulsions, the first impulsion etc., benefit unwholesome formations,  the  second  impulsion  etc,  by  means  of  efficiency  of  relations  of  contiguity (***anantara***),  immediate  contiguity  (***samanantara***),  contiguous  determinative  dependence (***anantarūpanissaya***),  habitual  recurrence  (***āsevana***),  absence  (***natthi***),  disappearance (***vigata***). (***Abhi-A-2-139, Vs-2-173***) 

**PAGE-437** 

Furthermore  in  the  continuum  of  a  person  who  commits  any  kind  of  immoral conducts randomly each unwholesome impulsion (= each unwholesome formation) consists of  ignorance.  That  ignorance  benefits,  associating  unwholesome  formation  ***dhammas***  by means  of  efficiency  of  relation  of  root  (***hetu***),  compatibility  (***sahajāta***),  mutuality (***aññamañña***),  dependence  (***nissaya***),  association  (***sampayutta***),  presence  (***atthi***),  non- disappearance (***avigata***). (***Abhi-A-2-137, Vs-2-173***) 

5. **Facts to be noticed** 

Consequence  round  ***dhammas***  of  present  life  of  practising  righteous  person,  if ***paṭisandhi*** and life-continuum etc., are significantly intended to be said, are only wholesome consequence (***kusala vipāka***) indeed. Those wholesome consequence ***dhammas***, ***paṭisandhi*** and life-continuum etc., arose due to sensual wholesome formations cultivated in previous life. However during life (***pavatti***) either sometimes wholesome consequence or sometimes unwholesome consequence can occur accordingly. Because those unwholesome consequence can  arise  frequently  through  unwholesome  formations  cultivated  in  previous  lives,  those unwholesome formation must be kept in mind during keeping in mind previous corporeality- mentality.  By  seeing  how  those  unwholesome  formations  arose  due  to  ignorance  \_\_\_\_\_ causal and resultant ***dhammas*** must be kept in mind as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

Due to arising of ignorance, unwholesome formations arise. 

Ignorance is causal ***dhammas***; unwholesome formations are resultant ***dhammas***. 

Furthermore  causal  and  resultant  ***dhammas***  can  be  kept  in  mind  continuously  by seeing  both  how  unwholesome  formations  arose,  due  to  arising  of  ignorance  and  how consequence round ***dhammas, paṭisandhi*** consciousness of woeful existence etc., arose due to those unwholesome formations with the help of insight knowledge sent towards successive previous lives. 
PAGE37

During keeping in mind the principle of dependent-origination of this present life as centre \_\_\_\_ in accordance with explanation, “***avijjā sańkhārā atīto addhā***”, \_\_\_\_\_ ignorance and  formations  were  past  periodic  ***dhammas***.  Therefore  only  those  kinds  of  ignorance, wholesome  and  unwholesome  formations,  unshakable  formations  (***āneñjābhisańkhāra***), which  had  been  cultivated  in  previous  successive  lives  throughout  rounds  of  rebirth  are emphatically  explained  and  presented  as  priority  in  this  work.  Among  (12)  factors  of dependent-origination\_\_\_\_\_ 

1. ignorance, formations are past periodic ***dhammas***; while 
1. consciousness,  mind-matter,  six-bases,  contact,  feeling,  craving,  clinging,  ***kamma*** coming-into-existence are present periodic ***dhammas***; 
1. birth, aging-death are future periodic ***dhammas*** respectively. 

After keeping in mind principle of causal relationship of these past, present, future periodic ***dhammas***, the righteous person can keep in mind both previous successive lives and future successive lives until end by sending penetrative knowledge systematically. 

**PAGE-438** 

The formations which are origin of some consequence round, present life ***paṭisandhi*** etc.,  are  sensual  wholesome  formations  (***kāmāvacara puññābhisańkhāra***)  only. Now  the righteous person has to keep in mind causal relationship between those sensual wholesome formations  and  some  consequence  round  ***dhammas,  paṭisandhi***  consciousness  etc., beforehand. After keeping in mind above all (12) factors of dependent origination thoroughly previous successive lives can be kept in mind similarly. 

When the righteous person sees how ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness of fine-material sphere arises  due  to  fine-material  wholesome  formation  (***rūpāvacara  puññābhisańkhāra***),  how ***paṭisandhi***  consciousness  of  immaterial  sphere  arises  due  to  immaterial  unshakable wholesome formation (***arūpāvacara āneñjābhisańkhāra***), and how ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness of  woeful  existence  arises  due  to  unwholesome  formations,  he  can  keep  in  mind  causal relationship  of  those  ***dhammas***  systematically.  Among  three  kinds  of  formations,  i.e., wholesome formation, unwholesome formation and unshakable wholesome formation, one kind of formation only can give rise to occur ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness for one coming-into- existence specifically. Therefore causal relationship must be kept in mind by seeing how appropriate kind of ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness arises due to specific kind of formation for specific coming-into existence accordingly. It should be understood the fact all three kinds of formations can not give rise to occur a single ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness in one coming-into- existence. 

Unless Four Noble Truth are known and seen penetratively until the end of rounds of rebirth or unless the ignorance is removed together with roots by the tweezers called the Noble Path of Arahant, the ignorance will be present apparently throughout future rounds of rebirth. 

Unless  the  ignorance  is  removed  together  with  roots  throughout  the  period,  the suffering of rounds of rebirth which is called continuity of perpetual processes of causal relationship of aggregates (***khandhā***), bases (***āyatana***), elements (***dhātu***), will be wrongly recognized,  known,  believed  as  bliss,  resulting  in  cultivating  wholesome  formations, unwholesome formations and unshakable wholesome formations which are origin of those suffering of rounds of rebirth all the time really. 

By scrutinizing how action round (***kamma vaṭṭta***) called formations (action) arose in previous life due to presence of defilement round (***kilesa vaṭṭa***) called ignorance (craving, clinging)\_\_\_\_\_ causal and resultant ***dhammas*** must be discerned and kept in mind in a way 

Translated by - ***Aññatara Bhikkhu*** \*  PAGE40

that \_\_\_\_\_ “due to arising of ignorance, formation arise; the ignorance is causal ***dhammas***, formations are resultant ***dhammas***”, etc. In this case previous life ignorance and formations arose generally in sequence of continuity of mind-door cognitive processes as follows:\_\_\_\_\_ 

6. **Mind-door cognitive processes of defilement round and action round** 



||mind-door advertence |(7) times of impulsions |(2) times of registering |
| :- | - | - | - |
|` `defilement round |12 |20 |12 |
|` `action round |12 |34 |34 |
For worldling persons ignorance usually arise as (20) mind and mental concomitants of greed wrong view group generally. Sometimes it usually arises as (19) mind and mental concomitants without pleasurable interest (***pīti***). Sometimes it usually arise (22/21) mind and mental concomitants with sloth-torpor (***thinamiddha***). Those are four kinds of unwholesome consciousness rooted in greed with wrong view (***lobhamūla diṭṭhigata sampayutta citta***). Sometimes four kinds of unwholesome consciousness rooted in greed without wrong view (***lobhamūla diṭṭhigata vippayutta citta***) can also arise and the righteous person should like to discern as they really occur. Registering consciousness can or can not fall in him. If it falls after  (7)  times  of  impulsion  with  pleasurable  interest  those  two  times  of  registering consciousness  also  consist  of  pleasurable  interest.  If  impulsion  are  not  associated  with pleasurable interest, those registering consciousness are also not associated with pleasurable interest. All (11) kinds of registering consciousness can arise accordingly. In this table only one kind of registering (***somanassa santīraņa tadārammaņa***) is shown as example. 

**PAGE-439** 

It should be recognized similarly for mind-door cognitive process of formation. Here sensual wholesome formation of mankind only is presented as priority of examples. Those consciousness of mind-door cognitive process of formation can associate with knowledge and pleasurable interest accordingly. As shown in tables of Meditation on Mentality, Volume II, numbers  of  mental  ***dhammas***  of  formations  can  be  varied  as  (34/33/33/32)  accordingly. Registering  consciousness  can  or  can  not  fall  in  him.  All  (11)  kinds  of  registering consciousness can fall accordingly. In this table only one kind of registering consciousness, great  consequence  registering  associating  joyful  with  knowledge  (***somanassa  sahagata ñāņasampayutta mahā vipāka tad-ārammaņa***), is shown as example. The righteous person should like to discern those kinds of consciousness as they really arose in previous live. 

It should be recognized the fact \_\_\_\_ 

1. mind-door cognitive processes of those defilement round are meant as “***ignorance***” and 
1. mind-door  cognitive  processes  of  those  action  round  are  meant  as  “***formations***” respectively. 

Each kind of compactness (***ghana***) of both sides has to be broken down by penetrative knowledge  and  it  must  be  reached  up  to  ultimate  nature.  Because  five-doors-cognitive processes  (***pañcadvāra  vīthi***)  can  not  give  rise  to  occur  ***paṭisandhi***,  mind-door-cognitive process only is presented in this work. 

As mentioned in the first method of explanation of the term ***paṭicca samuppāda***, in this world it is unable to arise a single-resultant ***dhamma*** due to a single causal ***dhamma*** ***… R …*** (***Abhi-A-2-140***) [Please see page 16,17, Volume III.] 

It should, therefore, be recognized that the ignorance is meant as the whole mind-door cognitive process of defilement round which are predominated with ignorance  while on the 
PAGE39

formation, as the whole mind-door cognitive process of action round which are predominated with volitional formation respectively. By breaking down mental compactness (***nāmaghana***) called bulk of mentality of both kinds of cognitive processes which are occurring as causal and resultant ***dhammas***; by keeping in mind each ***dhamma*** up to the field of ultimate nature with the help of penetrative knowledge; by seeing principle of causal relationship of those ultimate ***dhammas***; \_\_\_\_\_ both causal and resultant ***dhammas*** must be kept in mind in a way that \_\_\_\_\_ 

“due  to  arising  of  ignorance,  formations  arise;  ignorance  is  the  causal  ***dhamma***: formations  are  resultant  ***dhammas***;”  etc.  It  should  be  understood  similarly  on  how consciousness arises due to formation. 

**PAGE-440** 

7. **A reasonable question** 

In  this  case,  there  is  a  reasonable  question  that  \_\_\_\_\_\_  why  the  ignorance  with undesirable  consequence  called  ***aniṭṭha  phala***  and  great  faults  should  become  causal ***dhamma*** of wholesome formation and unshakable wholesome formation without fault but the nature of giving rise to desirable consequence. The bitter seed of neem tree (= margosa tree) can not give rise to grow sugar-cane really \_\_\_\_\_. 

This is a reasonable question. 

The answer \_\_\_\_\_ Why not? It is appropriate causal ***dhamma*** really. It is true \_\_\_\_. In the world there are apparent causal ***dhammas*** which are. 

1. either opposite or 
1. not opposite; 
1. either same or 
1. different from their resultant ***dhammas***. 

Those  resultant  ***dhammas***  are  not  mere  consequence  ***dhammas***  belonging  to consequence round. 

In the world there are both apparent causal ***dhamma*** which are opposite of resultant ***dhammas***  by  means  of  ***ṭhāna***  (lying,  existing),  ***sabhāna***  (specific  characteristic),  ***kicca*** (function) etc., and apparent causal ***dhammas*** which are not opposite of resultant ***dhammas*** in ***ṭhāna, sabhāva, kicca***. 

***ṭhānaviruddha***  \_\_\_\_\_  Preceding  consciousness  benefits  for  arising  of  succeeding consciousness by means of efficiency of relation of contiguity (***anantara paccaya***) etc. In that phenomenon  preceding  consciousness  is  the  opposite  causal  ***dhamma***  of  succeeding consciousness by lying (existing) apparently. (This is the causal ***dhamma*** in the aspect of the Supreme Buddha’s admonishment.) Previous learning, technology etc., is important factor of later  learning,  technology  etc.,  (This  is  the  causal  ***dhamma***  in  the  aspect  of  mundane situation.) This is the opposite causal ***dhamma*** by means of ***ṭhāna*** (= lying, existing). (***Abhi- A-2-141***) 

* ***ṭhānaviruddhoti athitāviruddho. (Mūlaṭī-2-100)*** 

In this case, according to the opposite causal ***dhamma*** by means of ***ṭhāna*** (***ṭhānavi- ruddha***) \_\_\_\_\_\_ it must be meant as the opposite causal ***dhamma*** by means of apparent lying (= existing) (***atthitāviruddha***). (***Anuṭī-2-110***) 

Translated by - ***Aññatara Bhikkhu*** \*  PAGE42

***sabhāvaviruddha*** \_\_\_\_\_ The action (***kamma***) is the opposite causal ***dhamma*** of corporeal ***dhamma*** by means of specific characteristic (***sabhāva viruddha***). Volition is designated as action  (***kamma***).  That  volitional  action  is  mental  ***dhamma***  indeed.  It  has  the  specific characteristic, inclining towards object (***namana lakkhaņa***). Corporeal ***dhamma***, actually, has the specific character, change and alteration called different occurrence of continuity of preceding and succeeding corporealities due to opposite factors, heat, coldness etc. 

**PAGE-441** 

Mental  ***dhamma***  is  the  ***dhamma***  which  is  capable  of  taking  object  (***sārammaņa dhamma***)  but  corporeal  ***dhamma***  is  the  ***dhamma***  which  is  incapable  of  taking  object (***anāaramaņa***).  The  action  (***kamma***)  has  the  specific  characteristic,  the  nature  of  urging (***cetanā  sabhāva***)  (=  the  nature  of  exhortation  in  order  to  reach  associated  ***dhamma***  on object).  Corporeal  ***dhamma***,  however,  has  the  nature  of  change  and  alteration  (***ruppana lakkhaņā***). Thus the causality, action is opposite to the resultant corporeal ***dhammas*** by means of specific characteristic. The causality, action which has opposite specific character benefits for arising of resultant corporeal ***dhammas***. (This is the causal ***dhamma*** in the aspect of the Supreme Buddha’s admonishment.) 

Milk has sweet flavour; it can extinguish potency of bile; it has the nature of arising of sweet effect. Yogurt, on the other hand, has sour flavour; it can proliferate potency of bile; it has the nature of arising of sour effect. Thus milk is the opposite to yogurt through nature. The  causality,  milk  which  has  opposite  nature  benefits  for  arising  of  resultant ***dhamma***, yogurt with opposite nature. (This is the causal ***dhamma*** in the aspect of mundane situation.) (***Abhi-A-2-141; Mūlaṭī-2-100; Anuṭī-2-110***).*** 

***kiccaviruddha***  \_\_\_\_\_  Light  is  an  essential  factor  for  arising  of  seeing-consciousness. (***cakkhuviññāņa***). The light is incapable of taking object because it is corporeal ***dhamma***. Seeing consciousness, on the other hand, is capable of taking object and distinguishing object (visible object). The light with function of incapable of distinguishing object is the causal ***dhamma*** with opposite function of seeing-consciousness which has the function of capable of distinguishing  object.  Some  basic  constituents,  molasses  etc.,  which  lack  the  function  of intoxication,  are  also  causal  ***dhammas***  with  opposite  function  of  alcohol  which  has  the function of intoxication. (***Abhi-A-2-141, Mūlaṭī-2-100***)

***cakkhurūpādayo pana cakkhuviññādīnam ṭhānāviruddhā paccayā. (Abhi-A-2-141)*** 

Eye-clear-sensitivity, visible object etc, are not opposite causal ***dhammas*** of seeing- consciousness etc., by means of apparent existing (lying), in the next method, the formers etc, are not opposite causal ***dhammas*** of the latter through lying place. (***Abhi-A-2-141***)

In above explanation of ***ṭhāna aviruddh***, it is explained that \_\_\_\_\_ depended base corporeality and object corporeality are not opposite causal ***dhammas*** of respective mental ***dhammas*** by means of apparent existing (lying)  (= ***ṭhāna aviruddha***), in the next method, the  formers  etc,  are  not  opposite  causal  ***dhammas***  of  the  latter  through  lying  place. Furthermore  in  the  causal  ***dhamma***  of  ***ṭhāna  aviruddha***,  it  is  explained  that  preceding 
PAGE41

consciousness  is  the  opposite  causal  ***dhamma***  of  succeeding  consciousness  by  means  of apparent existing (***atthitāviruddha***), according to sub-commentator Sayadaws. 

In  this  case,  it  is  essential  to  vet  the  fact  which  ***dhamma***  is  the  opposite  causal ***dhamma*** of which one through apparent existing. In the commentary it is explained that preceding consciousness is the opposite causal ***dhamma*** of succeeding consciousness through apparent existing (***ṭhānaviruddha paccaya***). 

**PAGE-442** 

The  causal  ***dhamma***  called  preceding  consciousness  is  absent  during  arising  of resultant  ***dhamma***  called  succeeding  consciousness  with  three-time-phases,  ***uppāda-ṭhiti- bhanga***. Therefore the meaning of “opposite causal ***dhamma*** through apparent existing” has to be vetted. In this case, some teachers of other school of thought (***keci ācariya***) suggested that the term, ***ṭhāna***, means ***paṭisandhi ṭhāna*** (= lying place of process of newly occurrence of next existence), ***bhavanga ṭhāna*** (lying place of life-continuum), ***cuti ṭhāna*** (lying place of death-consciousness). ***Mūlaṭīkā Sayadaw*** rejected that opinion of teachers of other school of thought(***kecivāda***) and explained that because the preceding life-continuum benefits the succeeding life-continuum with the same lying place, the preceding impulsion benefits the succeeding  impulsion  with  the  same  lying  place  by  means  of  efficiency  of  relation  of contiguity etc, those lying place called ***paṭsandhi ṭhāna***, ***bhavanga ṭhāna***, ***javana ṭhāna*** are not  desirable  opposite  causal  ***dhammas***  through  lying  place  (***ṭhāna  viruddha  paccaya***). (***Mūlaṭī-2-100***) 

In this case, therefore, the explanation, “preceding consciousness benefits succeeding consciousness by means of nature of ***ṭhānaviruddha***”, means that because only when the causal ***dhamma***, preceding consciousness ceases can the resultant succeeding consciousness arise,  while  the  latter  is  present  apparently  with  three-time-phases  called  ***uppāda-ṭhiti- bhanga***  the  causality,  preceding  consciousness  is  absent  through  three-time-phase  called ***uppāda-ṭhiti-bhanga***. Thus causal consciousness is not existing (lying) apparently (***aṭhāna***) but  resultant  consciousness  is  still  existing  (lying)  apparently,  resulting  in  occurrence  of opposite nature, i.e., ***aṭhāna***, ***ṭhāna*** between causal and resultant ***dhammas***. Thus the causal ***dhamma*** benefits for arising of resultant ***dhamma*** by means of the opposite nature of non- existing (***aṭhāna***), existing (***ṭhāna***). It should be deduced the meaning in this way. However it should be vetted on these explanations for wise persons. 

***sabhāva aviruddha, kicca aviruddh\_\_\_*** 

Preceding impulsion etc, are non-opposite causal ***dhammas*** of succeeding impulsion etc,  by  means  of  both  specific  characteristic  (***sabhāva***)  and  function  (***kicca***).  Preceding impulsion etc, have the same specific characters as succeeding impulsions etc., i.e., the same wholesome  impulsions  or  the  same  unwholesome  impulsions  or  the  same  indifferent impulsions or the same joyful impulsions or the same hateful impulsions or the same neutral impulsions (***upekkhājavana***). Both have the same functions of impulsions (***javana kicca***), resulting in absence of opposition. Preceding impulsions benefits succeeding impulsions by means of efficiency of relation of contiguity, habitual recurrence (***āsevana***) etc. When the first  registering  consciousness benefits  the  second  registering  consciousness by  means  of efficiency of relation of contiguity etc, causal ***dhamma*** is non-opposite to resultant ***dhamma*** through both specific-characteristic and function. In this case non-opposite means they have the same specific character and function.

As there are the opposite and non-opposite causal ***dhammas*** apparently in the world, there are also the same causal ***dhammas*** (***sadisa paccaya***) and the different causal ***dhamma*** (***asadisa paccaya***) apparently in the world. 

***sadisa paccaya***  \_\_\_\_\_ The corporeal ***dhamma*** with the same temperature (***sadisa utu***) is causal ***dhamma*** of corporeality produced by temperature (***utuja rūpa***) while the corporeal ***dhamma*** with the same nutriment (***sadisa ojā***) is causal ***dhamma*** of corporeality produced by nutriment (***āhāraja rūpa***). [It means ***utuja rūpa*** and ***āhāraja rūpa*** which are produced by the same  temperature  and  nutriment  (***sabhāga  utu,  sabhāga  āhāra***).]  This  is  how  causal ***dhamma*** is the same as resultant ***dhamma*** through nature (***dhamma***). 

**PAGE-443** 

Causal ***dhammas***, seed of fragrant rice etc, are the causal ***dhammas*** (***sadisa paccaya***) of resultant ***dhammas***, fruits of fragrant rice etc. The causality, seed of fragrant rice and the resultant  fruits  of  fragrant  rice  are  the  same  in  nature.  This  is  how  causal  and  resultant ***dhammas*** are the same in nature as a worldly simile indeed. (***Abhi-A-2-141***) 

***asadisa paccaya*** \_\_\_\_\_ Corporeal and  mental ***dhammas*** have different nature. Corporeal ***dhamma*** with different nature is causal ***dhamma*** of mental ***dhamma*** and vice versa. It refers to relation of object and relation of basic pre-compatibility (***vatthu purejāta***) etc, during benefiting  of  corporeality  fro  arising  of  mentality  and  to  relation  of  post-compatibility (***pacchājāta***)  etc,  during  benefiting  of  mentality  for  maintenance  of  corporeality.  Cow’s bodily hair and goat’s bodily hair are causal ***dhamma*** of Bermuda grass, ***Cynodon dactylon***. Those causal ***dhammas***, horn, yogurt, sesame dough etc, are different causal ***dhammas*** of some resultant ***dhammas***, grass, fragrance, straw etc. (***Abhi-A-2-141***) 

Furthermore \_\_\_\_\_ such causal ***dhammas*** are 

1. ***viruddha*** = opposite causal ***dhammas***, 
1. ***aviruddha*** = non-opposite causal ***dhammas***, 
1. ***sadisa*** = same causal ***dhammas***, 
1. ***asadisa***  =  different  causal  ***dhammas***  of  such  resultant  ***dhammas***.  Those  resultant ***dhammas***  are  not  mere  consequence  ***dhamma***  (***vipāka  dhamma***)  of  those  causal ***dhammas***  really.  It  should,  therefore,  be  recognized  the  fact  that  even  though  it  has undesirable  effect  certainly  and  it  occurs  with  faults  through  nature  with  relating  to consequence  ***dhamma***  which  can  be  arisen  by  itself,  this  ignorance  is  capable  of benefiting  to  those  wholesome  formation,  unwholesome  formation,  unshakable wholesome  formation  by  means  of  existing  (lying)  place  (***ṭhāna***),  function  (***kicca***), specific characteristic (***sabhāva***), which are occurring as both the opposite, non-opposite causal ***dhammas*** and the same, different causal ***dhammas*** accordingly. (***Abhi-A-2-141***) 

A person is bewildered in these five circumstances, viz., (1) death (2) conception (3) rounds of rebirth (***samsāra***) (4) character of conditioned things (***sańkhāra lakkhaņā***) (5) resultant ***dhammas*** which are arising based on causal ***dhammas*** (= ***paṭicca samuppanna dhamma***). That person cultivates those three kinds of formations surely. It can, therefore, be known the fact this ignorance is causal ***dhamma*** of all three kinds of formations. 

1. ***Bewilderment in death*** \_\_\_\_\_ Due to inability to distinguish and reason in death called destruction of aggregates in a way that “destruction of aggregates are designated as death” in all  kinds  of  lives  by  insight  knowledge,  the  person  with  bewilderment  in  death  thinks 
PAGE43

diversely about various ideas that \_\_\_\_\_ “being is dead; being transfers to other place (= other coming-into-existence)” etc. (***Abhi-A-2-142***) 

2. ***Bewilderment  in  conception***  \_\_\_\_\_  Due  to  inability  to  distinguish  and  reason  in conception in a way that “apparent arising of aggregates is designated as birth (***jāti***)” in all kinds of coming-into-existence, the person with bewilderment in conception thinks diversely about various ideas that \_\_\_\_\_ “being has got conception; new form and shape of body of being arises apparently” etc. (It is similar to a kind of idea that “mankind is born through ovum and sperm of parents” etc. (***Abhi-A-2-142***) 

**PAGE-444** 

In this world some persons hold wrong belief in a way that “as new clothes are worn after old and faded ones are abandoned, the self (***atta***) takes reincarnation with new body by searching happiness after abandoning old body”. (***Number 22 verse, Bhagavāgīti Section*** 

***11***). It means that kind of belief. (***Translation by Pyi Sayadaw-4-98***) 

3. **Bewilderment in rounds of rebirth (*samsāra*)** 

Perpetual  processes  of  arising  and  passing  away  of  continuity  of  corporeality- mentality, aggregates, bases, elements is called ***samsāra*** (rounds of rebirth). Due to inability to distinguish and reason on that ***samsāra*** as “perpetual processes of arising and passing away of continuity of aggregates, bases elements” \_\_\_\_\_ the person with bewilderment in rounds of rebirth thinks diversely about various ideas that \_\_\_\_\_ “this being goes from this world to next world; he comes from other world to this world,” etc. (***Abhi-A-2-142***) 

4. **Bewilderment in characters of conditioned things (*sańkhāra lakkhaņā*)** 

Due  to  inability  to  distinguish  and  reason  both  specific  characters  and  general characters called ***anicca, dukkha, anatta*** of conditioned things, the person with bewilderment in characters of conditioned things thinks diversely on them as self-identity (***atta***), property of self identity, permanence (***dhuva***), comely one (***subha***), happiness (***sukkha***) etc. (***Abhi-A-2- 142***) 

5. **Bewilderment in resultant *dhammas* which are arising based on causal *dhammas*** 

Due to inability to distinguish and reason how resultant ***dhammas***, formations etc, arise  depending  on  causal  ***dhammas***,  ignorance  etc.,  the  person  with  bewilderment  in resultant ***dhammas*** which are arising based on causal ***dhammas*** (= ***paṭicca samuppanna dhamma***) thinks diversely about various ideas that \_\_\_\_\_ “self-identity is both perceptive and non-perceptive;  that  self-identity  only  does  itself  and  commands  others  to  do;  that  self- identity  arises  during  ***paṭisandhi***  (=  it  can  take  conception);  those  creators  of  that  self identity,  i.e.,  very  fine  sub-particle  (***paramāņumyū***),  ***paramesvā***,  great  ***brahma***  etc, accomplish controlling faculties, eye etc, through well establishing embryo at the moment of conception etc; due to completion with controlling faculties, eye etc, that self-identity come into contact with object, and feels and performs craving called hanger for, pine for; it is obsessive and performs link between the previous and the next coming-into-existence; that self identity takes reincarnation in the next coming-into-existence again”; and 

“as fixedly permanent continuity of undestructable ruby balls, coloured glass balls which are strung by unbreakable string, all kinds of beings designated as “***atta*** (self-identity) incline to various coming-into-existences, heavenly being, human being etc, due to fixedly permanent coincidence which can be said consecutive arising of self-identity called ***atta*** in

one destination (***gati***) after another, one birth (***jāti***) after another, one coming-into-existence after another accordingly”. (***Abhi-A-2-142***) 

Because  the  ignorance  performs  to  be  blind  though  one  is  not  blind  that  being establishes three kinds of formations through thinking diversely about various ideas as shown in these ways.

5. ***sańkhāra paccayā viññāņam*** 

**Due to arising of formation, consciousness arises.** 

Those kinds of consciousness which are arisen due to formations are “(32) kinds of mundane consequence consciousness (***lokiya vipāka viññāņa***). Those kind are, 

1. unwholesome consequence consciousness without root-cause ……  (7) kinds 
1. wholesome consequence consciousness without root-cause ………  (8) kinds 
1. great consequence consciousness ……   (8) kinds 
1. Fine-material Sphere consequence consciousness ……   (5) kinds, 
1. Immaterial Sphere consequence consciousness ……  (4) kinds, 

totally …..  (32) kinds. 

If those (32) kinds are counted in brief in the next method, those are (6) kinds of consciousness-elements,  viz.,  seeing-consciousness,  hearing-consciousness,  smelling- consciousness, tasting-consciousness, touching-consciousness, mind-consciousness-element. 

There are (5) kinds of wholesome consciousness, viz., seeing-consciousness, hearing- consciousness,  smelling-consciousness,  tasting-consciousness,  touching-consciousness  and 

5) kinds of unwholesome consequences, viz., seeing-consciousness, hearing-consciousness, smelling-consciousness,  tasting-consciousness,  touching-consciousness.  If  two  kinds  of wholesome and unwholesome consequence are added together, these are (10) kinds in total, which are called two five-fold consciousness (10) (***dvepañcaviññāņa***). Remaining (22) kinds of  consequence  consciousness,  excluding  those  two  five-fold-consciousness  (10),  are designated as mind-consciousness-element (***manoviññāņa dhātu***). 

In other words \_\_\_\_\_ those kinds of consequence consciousness which are arisen due to  formations  are  ***paṭisandhi***  (  =  process  of  **n**ewly  **o**ccurrence  of  **n**ext  **e**xistence,  called process of NONE) - ***bhavanga*** (life-continuum) - ***cuti*** (death) – ***pañcaviññāņa*** (fivefold- consciousness)  -  ***sampaṭicchana***  (receiving)  –  ***santīraņa***  (investigating)  –  ***tadārammaņa*** (registering)  consequence  consciousness.  In  the  continuum  of  righteous  ***meditator***  it  is impossible to arise both kinds of consequence consciousness of Fine-material Sphere and Immaterial Sphere in present human’s existence. Those kinds of consequence consciousness could be occurred, only in either previous successive lives of rounds of rebirth or in future life of rounds of rebirth, if essential factors could be united. Those kinds of consequence consciousness,  viz.,  (7)  kinds  of  unwholesome  consequence  consciousness  without  root- cause, (8) kinds of wholesome consequence consciousness without root-cause, (8) kinds of great consequence consciousness, totally (23) kinds of consequence consciousness only can  be occurred in present life accordingly. 

***Pali Quotation (Abhi-A-2-142, 143, Vs-2-177)*** 

The  preaching  methodology  of  dependent-origination,  actually,  is  the  preaching showing how rounds of rebirth cycles (***vaṭṭakathā desanā***). It is impossible to arise four kinds of  consciousness  of  the  Noble  Fruit  (-moment)  called  Supra-mundane  consequence consciousness (***lokuttara vipāka viññāņa)*** in that section of preaching showing how rounds of rebirth cycles. Therefore according to the term, ***viññāņa*** (= consciousness) only mundane kinds of consequence consciousness should be inferred but not Supra-mundane consequence consciousness.

1. **How it can be known?** 

There  is  a  question  how  consequence  consciousness arises  due  to  formation.  The answer is as follows:\_\_\_\_\_ 

***Pali Quotation (Abhi-A-2-143, Vs-2-177)*** 

If  well  cultivated  action  (***kamma***)  is  absent,  the  resultant  ***dhamma***,  consequence consciousness  can  not  arise  and  then  it  can  be  known  the  arising  of  consequence consciousness  due  to  formation.  The  consciousness  produced  by  this  formation  is consequence consciousness only. Consequence consciousness can never arise without well cultivate  action  ***dhamma***  (***kamma***)  really.  If  it  can  arise  without  the  latter,  all  kinds  of consequence consciousness can arise in the continuum of all kinds of beings. Those never, actually, arise in the continuum of all kinds of being. Thus this meaning, “due to formation, this consequence consciousness arises”, can be understood. (***Abhi-A-2-143, Vs-2-177***) 

1. ***kāmāvacara puññābhisańkhāra* (sensuous sphere wholesome formation)\_\_\_\_\_** 

Wholesome  volition  through  charity,  wholesome  volition  through  morality, wholesome volition through practice with preliminary concentration (***parikamma bhāvanā***) and  practice  with  access  concentration  (***upacāra  bhāvanā***);  wholesome  volition  through ***vipassanā*** practice, which were cultivated and surrounded by ignorance, craving, clinging in previous life, were great wholesome volitions called ***kāmāvacara puññābhi sańkhāra***. Those are volitions associating with (8) kinds of great wholesome consciousness indeed. Due to arising of those great wholesome volitions, (8) kinds of wholesome consequences without root-cause, (8) kinds of great consequences, totally (16) kinds of consequence consciousness arise. (***Abhi-1-104, 116***) 

Those are consequence consciousness with the functions of ***paṭisandhi-bhavangacuti*** (process  of  newly  occurrence  of  next  existence-life-continuum-death)  and  seeing- consciousness  (hearing-consciousness,  smelling-consciousness,  tasting-consciousness, touching-consciousness),  receiving  consciousness,  investigating  consciousness,  registering consciousness, which arise by taking (6) kinds of objects appropriately. 

2. ***rūpāvacara puññābhi sańkhāra* (Fine-material Sphere wholesome formation)** 

Due  to  arising  of  (5)  kinds  of  Fine-material  Sphere  wholesome  volitions  called ***rūpāvacara  puññābhi  sańkhāra***,  (5)  kinds  of  Fine-material  Sphere  consequence consciousness  arise.  Those  are  consequence  consciousness  with  functions  of  ***paṭisandhi- bhavanga-cuti***, which are arising in (15) realms of Fine-material Sphere, excluding mindless being (***a saññasatta***). In the realm of mindless being, actually, corporeal ***paṭisandhi*** called vital nonads corporeal units (***jīvitanavaka kalāpa***) only are produced by that Fine-material Sphere wholesome formation. (***Abhi-1-116***) 

3. ***a puññābhi sańkhāra* (unwholesome formation)** 

Due to arising of (12) kinds of unwholesome volitions called ***a puññābhi sańkhāra*** 

(7) kinds of unwholesome consequence consciousness without root-cause arise. Those are various  consequence  consciousness  called  seeing-consciousness  (hearing-consciousness, smelling-consciousness,  tasting-consciousness,  touching-consciousness)  which  arise  by taking  (6)  kinds  of  undesirable  objects  (***anitthārammaņa***)  appropriately,  and  various

investigating consequences consciousness with neutrality feeling (***upekhāsahagata santīraņa vipāka viññāņa***) which have functions of ***paṭisandhi-bhangacuti*** in woeful realms. (***Abhi-1- 116***) 

**PAGE-449** 

4. ***āneñjābhi sańkhāra* (unshakable wholesome formation)** 

Due  to  arising  of  (4)  kinds  of  Immaterial  Sphere  wholesome  volitions  called ***āneñjābhi sańkhāra***, (4) kinds of Immaterial consequence consciousness arise accordingly. Those  are  consequence  consciousness  with  functions  of  ***paṭisandhi-bhanga-cuti***  in Immaterial Sphere accordingly. (***Abhi-1-117***) 

2. **Consequence consciousness of *pavatti* (during life) and *paṭisandhi*** 

These are varied as two kinds, viz., 

1. consequence consciousness occurring during life, 
1. consequence consciousness occurring during ***paṭisandhi***. 

Among those two kinds, these (13) kinds of consequence consciousness without root- cause (***ahetuka vipāka viññāņa***), viz., 

1. two-fivefold-consciousness ……   10 
1. receiving consciousness ……..      2 
1. joyful investigating consciousness …..    1 

are occurring during life (***pavatti***) only in five-groups-existence (***pañcavokāra nbhūmi***). These  are  wholesome  consequences  without  root-cause  viz.,  fivefold-consciousness, receiving-consciousness,  investigating-consciousness,  joyful  investigating  registering consciousness, which arise by taking desirable object and moderate desirable object; and unwholesome  consequence  without  root-cause,  viz.,  fivefold-consciousness,  receiving consciousness  which  arise  by  taking  undesirable  object  and  moderate  undesirable  object indeed. 

Those  (19)  kinds  of  ***paṭisandhi***  consciousness,  which  are  capable  of  performing functions of ***paṭisandhi***, ***bhavanga, cuti, santīraņa, tadāramaņa*** (= process of NONE, life continuum, death, investigating, registering accordingly, Arise accordingly both during life and  during  ***paṭisandhi***  in  three  realms  called  Sensuous  Sphere,  Fine-material  Sphere, Immaterial Sphere. (***Abhi-A-2-144,145***) 

3. **Nature of Things** 

In the continuum of person with gradually matured controlling faculties, who has got ***paṭisandhi***  (process  of  Newly  Occurrence  of  Next  Existence)  through  either  wholesome consequence  consciousness  in  joyful  existences  (***sugati  bhūmi***)  or  unwholesome consequence  consciousness  in  woeful  existences  (***duggatibhūmi***),  those  fivefold consciousness, seeing-consciousness etc, which are wholesome consequences, arise by taking objects, visible object etc, which are either desirable or moderate desirable objects striking each  clear-sensitivity,  eye-clear-sensitivity  etc,  after  finishing  respective  functions,  i.e., functions  of  seeing  (***dassana  kicca***),  function  of  hearing  (***savanna  kicca***),  function  of smelling  (***ghāyaņakicca***),  function  of  licking  (***sāyanakicca***)  function  of  touching (***phusanakicca***)  depending  on  clear-sensitive-corporeality  (***pasāda  rūpa***),  eye-clear- sensitivity etc. 
PAGE49

Similarly  various  unwholesome  consequence  fivefold-consciousness  also  arise  by taking fivefold-objects (***pañcārammaņa***), visible object etc, which are either undesirable or moderate undesirable ones. These (10) kinds of two-fivefold-consciousness have got fixed doors,  fixed  objects,  fixed  depended  bases,  fixed  lying  places  and  fixed  functions respectively. (***Abhi-A-2-145***)

1. All seeing-consciousness always arise by taking only visible-object, depending on eye-clear-sensitivity, and lying place of fivefold-consciousness in the eye-door after performing the function of seeing. 
1. All hearing-consciousness always arise by taking only audible-object, depending on ear-clear-sensitivity, and lying place of fivefold-consciousness in the ear-door after performing the function of hearing. 
1. All smelling-consciousness always arise by taking only olfactory-object, depending on nose-clear-sensitivity, and lying place of fivefold-consciousness in the nose-door after performing the function of smelling 
1. All  tasting-consciousness  always  arise  by  taking  only  sapid-object,  depending  on tongue-clear-sensitivity, and lying place of fivefold-consciousness in the tongue-door after performing the function of tasting. 
1. All touching-consciousness always arise by taking only tactile-object, depending on body-clear-sensitivity,  and  lying  place  of  fivefold-consciousness  in  the  body-door after performing the function of touching. 

Then seeing-consciousness of unwholesome consequence takes undesirable and moderate undesirable  visible-objects,  while  that  of  wholesome  consequence  takes  desirable  and moderate  desirable  visible-objects.  It  should  be  understood  similarly  on  hearing- consciousness of both unwholesome and wholesome consequences etc. It should, therefore, be recognized as follows:\_\_\_\_\_ 

1. By taking desirable and moderate desirable visible-objects, seeing-consciousness of wholesome  consequence,  receiving-consciousness,  investigating  consciousness, registering-consciousness  arise.  By  taking  undesirable  and  moderate  undesirable visible-objects,  seeing-consciousness  of  unwholesome  consequence,  receiving- consciousness, investigating-consciousness, registering-consciousness arise. 
1. By taking desirable and moderate desirable audible-objects, hearing-consciousness of wholesome  consequence,  receiving-consciousness,  investigating  consciousness, registering-consciousness  arise.  By  taking  undesirable  and  moderate  undesirable audible-objects,  hearing-consciousness  of  unwholesome  consequence,  receiving- consciousness, investigating-consciousness, registering-consciousness arise. 
1. By taking desirable and moderate desirable olfactory-objects, smelling-consciousness of  wholesome  consequence,  receiving-consciousness,  investigating  consciousness, registering-consciousness  arise.  By  taking  undesirable  and  moderate  undesirable olfactory-objects,  smelling-consciousness  of  unwholesome  consequence,  receiving- consciousness, investigating-consciousness, registering-consciousness arise. 
1. By taking desirable and moderate desirable sapid-objects, tasting-consciousness of wholesome  consequence,  receiving-consciousness,  investigating  consciousness, registering-consciousness  arise.  By  taking  undesirable  and  moderate  undesirable sapid-objects,  tasting-consciousness  of  unwholesome  consequence,  receiving- consciousness, investigating-consciousness, registering-consciousness arise.

5. By taking desirable and moderate desirable tactile-objects, touching-consciousness of wholesome  consequence,  receiving-consciousness,  investigating  consciousness, registering-consciousness  arise.  By  taking  undesirable  and  moderate  undesirable tactile-objects,  touching-consciousness  of  unwholesome  consequence,  receiving- consciousness, investigating-consciousness, registering- consciousness arise. 

Thus it should be recognized respectively. **PAGE-451**
