Due to presence of influence of there (27) kinds of relations, mental aggregates of process of NONE occur and exist. (It should be understood other ways in which one aggregate each or two aggregates each etc can be divided and discerned similarly due to presence of mutually benefiting of four mental aggregates.)

#### **D. Five aggregates of life-continuum**

Among five aggregates of life-continuum, the heart, which is dependence of present life-continuum, consists of (54) kinds of corporealities because mental **_dhammas_** of lifecontinuum occur depending upon heart-base. However at the moment of first life-continuum, there are corporealities produced by three causes only, CPK, CPM, CPT. When the nourishment ingested by the mother is spread out into the foetus corporealities produced by nutriment (CPN) would occur. Therefore CPN must be discerned only when they are occurring. This is intended to say only about mankind who has foetal stage. It will be continued to present conditional relations of those corporeal **_dhammas_** as follows:\_\_\_\_

#### **(i) Corporeal aggregates of life-continuum**

Corporealities which are synchronous arising with life-continuum are (1) CPK (during life), (2) CPM, (3) CPT and (4) CPN. (If CPN is unable to occur it must be omitted.) Corporealities which are synchronous occurring with static and perishing phases of life-continuum are (1) CPK during life, (2) CPT and (3) CPN. (If CPN is unable to occur it must be omitted.)

Those mental ***dhammas*** may be either consciousness of cognitive process or consciousness free from cognitive process. In this case, the latter is referred to consciousness of life-continuum especially. It means function of benefiting of succeeding mental ***dhammas*** of life-continuum to CPK which are arising simultaneously with preceding life-continuum and are reaching into static stage of corporeality.]

By means of mind moments — five-doors advertence, fivefold consciousness, receiving, investigating, determining, first impulsion, second impulsion, third impulsion, fourth impulsion, fifth impulsion, sixth impulsion, seventh impulsion, first registering, second registering, these are totally, (14) kinds indeed.

In detail — these are of (54) kinds of consciousness. It will be continued to present occurrence of five aggregates of those mind moments and how conditional relations can be discerned in each mind moment respectively. Among those consciousness, indifferent impulsions (**_kiriya_** **_javana_**) are omitted because these are concerning with Arahant only.

#### **Notes to be understood before hand — how corporealities occur**

In five doors cognitive process, those corporealities which are able to occur simultaneously with three-time-phases, **_uppāda_**, **_ţhiti_**, **_bhańga_**, of fivefold consciousness are of three kinds, (1) CPK (during life) (2) CPT (3) CPN.

#### **P.(ii) Lofty wholesome impulsions** \_\_\_\_ There are

` `(18) kinds of cognitive processes of lofty wholesome deeds, for pentad method, to wit,

1. beginning lofty wholesome impulsions 9 processes
1. attaining lofty wholesome impulsions 9 processes

` `In the pentad method, factors of absorptions called **_vitakka vicāra_** are rejected one by one, resulting in five kinds of absorptions in fine-material sphere. If (4) kinds of absorption of immaterial sphere are added, there are (9) kinds of lofty absorptions, resulting in (9) kinds of cognitive processes of lofty ones. Those kinds of cognitive processes of lofty ones are presented in volume 2, **_nāmakammaţţhāna_**. It can be seen how absorptions of immaterial sphere can be discerned in volume 5, section of **_samatha_** **_kammaţţhāna_**. In order to be understood the occurrence of cognitive process of absorption would be presented again.

**PAGE 638**

#### ` `**(1) Beginning lofty wholesome cognitive process (_ādikammika mahaggatakusala vīthi_)**

These are life-continuum (shaking) **_bhavanga calana_**), life-continuum (interruption) (**_bhavangupaccheda_**), mind-door advertence (**_mamodvaravajjana_**), preliminary function (**_parikamma_**), access (**_upacāra_**) adaptation (**_anuloma_**) translineage (**_gotrabhu_**) which is severing of sensuous sphere (**_Gotrabhu_**), successively. Then any one of (9) kinds of lofty wholesome impulsions occurs and performs it's function of full concentration and then it ceases for once only, due to occurrence of beginning process. Then any one of (13) kinds of life continuum with three roots falls for a few times as much as it is worth arising as lifecontinuum, life- continuum, life-continuum,-------- and the beginning cognitive process of absorption ceases for first experience.

#### **(2) Attaining lofty wholesome cognitive process (_samāpatti mahaggata kusala vīthi)_**

These are life-continuum (shaking), life-continuum (interruption) mind door advertence, preliminary function, access, translineage, successively. Then any one of (9) kinds of lofty wholesome impulsions occurs many times as continuity of life continuum and it performs it's function of full concentration and perishing away. Then any one of (13) kinds of life-continuum with three roots falls for a few times much, as it is worth occurring as lifecontinuum and then continuity of process ceases.

Among those (18) kinds of cognitive processes, in accordance with pentad method, in these cognitive processes of wholesome fine material sphere, i.e, cognitive process of first absorption, that of second absorption, that of Third absorption, that of Fourth absorption. Those consciousness which perform functions of preliminary work, access, adaptation, translineage, are any one of two kinds of joyful impulsion with knowledge of great whole some deeds (prompted, unprompted) (**_mahākusala ñaņasampayutta somanassa javana 'sasańkhārika' 'a-sańkhārika_**).

` `In accordance with pentad method in cognitive process of fifth absorption, or in accordance with tetrad method, in cognitive process of fourth absorption and those kinds of absorptions of immaterial sphere, those consciousness which perform functions of preliminary, access, adaptation, translineage, are any one of two kinds of neutral (indifferent) impulsions with knowledge of great wholesome deeds (prompted, unprompted) (**_mahākusala ñaņasampayutta upekkhājavana 'sasańkhārika' 'a-sańkhārika_**)

` `In the discerning of causal relationship called doctrine of dependent-origination by scrutinizing on causal **_dhammas_** of both successive past existences and successive future existences, those cyclic **_dhammas_** of defilements, led by ignorance, craving, clinging, are similar to conditional relations of impulsion rooted in greed. Those unwholesome **_kamma_** formation and wholesome **_kamma_** formation are the same as conditional relations of unwholesome impulsions and wholesome impulsions respectively.
