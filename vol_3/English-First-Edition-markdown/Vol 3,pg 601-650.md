#### **C. Four mental aggregates of process of NONE of person with three roots in sensuous sphere** 
Those resultant ***dhammas***, four kinds of mental aggregates of process of NONE, which are of four kinds of persons with three roots in sensuous sphere (34 or 33 mentalities) occur and exist by means of influence of these (27) kinds of relations —

1.(a) Those real ***dhammas***, four kinds of mental aggregates of process of NONE which are of four kinds of persons with three roots in sensuous sphere (34 or 33 mentalities) are conditioned by means of influences of ***sahajāta***, ***aññamañña***, ***nissaya***, ***vipāka***, ***sampayutta***, ***atthi***, ***avigata*** “of causal ***dhammas*** called mental aggregates of process of NONE which are capable of benefiting each other”,

\2. by means of influence of ***sahajāta***, ***aññamañña***, ***nissaya***, “***vippayutta***”, ***atthi***, ***avigata***, of heart-base which arises simultaneously with itself (mental aggregates of process of 

NONE, 

(varieties of relation of corporeality compatibility = 6 kinds) 


#### **PAGE-603** 


3. by means of influence of ***ārammaņa*** of any kind of objects, viz, action, sign of action 

(***kamma*** ***nimitta***), sign of existence which could be reached (***gati*** ***nimitta***), (1 relation)

(varieties of relation of ***nānākkhaņika*** ***kamma*** = 2 kinds); totally (27) kinds of relations. 

Due to presence of influence of there (27) kinds of relations, mental aggregates of process of NONE occur and exist. (It should be understood other ways in which one aggregate each or two aggregates each etc can be divided and discerned similarly due to presence of mutually benefiting of four mental aggregates.) 
#### **D. Five aggregates of life-continuum** 
Among five aggregates of life-continuum, the heart, which is dependence of present life-continuum, consists of (54) kinds of corporealities because mental ***dhammas*** of lifecontinuum occur depending upon heart-base. However at the moment of first life-continuum, there are corporealities produced by three causes only, CPK, CPM, CPT. When the nourishment ingested by the mother is spread out into the foetus corporealities produced by nutriment (CPN) would occur. Therefore CPN must be discerned only when they are occurring. This is intended to say only about mankind who has foetal stage. It will be continued to present conditional relations of those corporeal ***dhammas*** as follows:\_\_\_\_ 
#### **(i) Corporeal aggregates of life-continuum** 
Corporealities which are synchronous arising with life-continuum are (1) CPK (during life), (2) CPM, (3) CPT and (4) CPN. (If CPN is unable to occur it must be omitted.) Corporealities which are synchronous occurring with static and perishing phases of life-continuum are (1) CPK during life, (2) CPT and (3) CPN. (If CPN is unable to occur it must be omitted.) 
#### **(a) How CPK which are synchronous with life-continuum occur and exist during life** 
Resultant ***dhammas*** called CPK during life occur and exist by means of influence of these (16) kinds of relations, viz,

(varieties of relation of corporeally compatibility = 5 kinds); 

1. ***pacchājāta***, ***vippayutta***, ***atthi***, ***avigata*** of succeeding mental aggregates, of receiving consciousness (4 varieties); 

[**Notes:** succeeding mental aggregates are those consciousness and mental concomitants adjacent to life-continuum which is discerning recently. Those mental ***dhammas*** may be either consciousness of cognitive process or consciousness free from cognitive process. In this case, the latter is referred to consciousness of life-continuum especially. It means function of benefiting of succeeding mental ***dhammas*** of life-continuum to CPK which are arising simultaneously with preceding life-continuum and are reaching into static stage of corporeality.]

#### **(ii) Four mental aggregates of life-continuum** 
“Those resultant ***dhammas***, four mental aggregates of life-continuum (34, 33) of person with three roots in sensuous sphere”, occur and exist by means of influence of (26) kinds of relations, viz,

`  `Due to presence of influence of these (26) kinds of relations mental aggregates of life-continuum occur and exist. 

[**Notes:** — Way of occurrence of five aggregates of advertence and impulsions rooted in greed which are strongly attach on newly existence (***bhava* *nikantika javana***), after 15th or 16th life-continuum, the first life-continuum etc, had been occurred, could be understood similar to five-aggregates of advertence and impulsions rooted in greed which will be present later.] 
#### **(e) Consciousness of five-doors cognitive process (*pañcadvārika* *vīthi* *citta*)** 
In brief — there are (7) kinds of consciousness of five doors cognitive processes, viz, five-doors-advertence (***pañcadvārāvajjana***), fivefold consciousness (***pañcaviññāņa**)* receiving, investigating, determining, impulsions, registerings. 

By means of mind moments — five-doors advertence, fivefold consciousness, receiving, investigating, determining, first impulsion, second impulsion, third impulsion, fourth impulsion, fifth impulsion, sixth impulsion, seventh impulsion, first registering, second registering, these are totally, (14) kinds indeed. 

In detail — these are of (54) kinds of consciousness. It will be continued to present occurrence of five aggregates of those mind moments and how conditional relations can be discerned in each mind moment respectively. Among those consciousness, indifferent impulsions (***kiriya*** ***javana***) are omitted because these are concerning with Arahant only. 
#### **Notes to be understood before hand — how corporealities occur** 
In five doors cognitive process, those corporealities which are able to occur simultaneously with three-time-phases, ***uppāda***, ***ţhiti***, ***bhańga***, of fivefold consciousness are of three kinds, (1) CPK (during life) (2) CPT (3) CPN. 


#### **PAGE 608** 


Those corporealities which are able to occur simultaneously with arising stage (***uppāda***) of five-doors advertence, receiving, investigating, determining, impulsions, registering, except fivefold consciousness are of four kinds, (1) CPK during life (2) CPM (3) CPT (4) CPN. 

Those corporealities which are able to occur simultaneously with static and perishing phases (***ţhiti***, ***bhańga***) of above consciousness are of three kinds, (1) CPK during life (2) CPT (3) CPN.
