**An Auspicious Night (_Bhaddekarattasuttan_)**

Before _Bhaddekarattasuttan_, description will be first made of _paccekkha ñān_. _a_ (the practical knowledge) and _anvaya ñā_._n_ _a_ (theoretical knowledge), related to meditating on the past and future, which the _yogavacara_ persons (practicing individuals) should know beforehand.

**_Paccekkha Ñān_**. **_a_ and _Anvaya Ñān_**. **_a_**

In accordance with the above _Atthakathā dīkā_ (Commentary) _anvaya_ is of two kinds: _tadanvaya dhamma_ and _anvaya ñān_. _a_. Then the _anvaya ñā_._n_ _a_ too is of

1. One that consistently follows _Vipassanā Ñān_. _a_ (insight knowledge) and
1. One that consistently follows the _Ariya Magga Ñā_._n_ _a_ and _Phala_ _Ñā_._n_ _a_ (Noble Path

 knowledge and Fruit knowledge).

-   .

Of these two the _anvaya ñāna_ that consistently follows _Vipassanā Ñāna_ will first

be dealt with.

Noble Ones ... I preach the nature of _Ariya Magga_ and _Phala_ (Noble Path and Fruit), where all _āsava_ (cankers) are not present any more, only to those who on their own know penetratively by _sammāditthi ñān_. _a_ (the knowledge of right understanding) and who see penetratively by _sammāditthi ñā_._n_ _a_. I do not preach to those who do not know or see on their own penetratively by _sammāditthi ñān_. _a_.

Noble Ones ... what is that they know and see on their own penetratively by _sammāditthi ñāna_ so that _āsava_-free _Ariya Magga_ and _Phala_ are attained?

1. (a) This is (_rūpa_) corporeality,

    2. These are the nature and cause of corporeality,
    3. These are the nature and cause of cessation of corporeality.

1. (a) This is _vedanā_ (suffering),

    2. These are the nature and cause of the _vedanā_,
    3. These are the nature and cause of cessation of _vedanā_.

1. (a) This is _saññā_ (perception)

    2. These are the nature and cause of _saññā_,
    3. These are the nature and cause of cessation of _saññā_.

1. (a) These are the _cetasika_ (mind and mental properties),

    2. These are the nature and cause of _cetasika_,
    3. These are the nature and cause of cessation of _cetasika_.

1. (a) This is _viññāna_ (cognition),

2) These are the nature and cause of _viññāna_,
3) These are the nature and cause of cessation of _viññāna_.

Only those individuals who see and know the above five penetratively by knowledge of righ.t understanding (_samāditthi ñān_. _a_) can the _āsava_-free _Ariya Magga_ and _Phala_ appear (_Sam_.-1: 267).

What this _desanā_ (doctrine) means is as follows:

1. The five corporeality
1. The cause or formation of these five = formed with _samudaya_ (arising) = _samudaya_

-   nature of rising

3. Cessation of these five corporeality = ceased with disappearance = disappearance =

 the nature of disappearance with time (or age). Only when these three are penetratively known and seen by _sammāditthi ñān_. _a_ can _Ariya Magga Ñān_. _a_ and _Phala_ _Ñān_. _a_, wherein all the _āsava_ have ceased, be attained.

The Commentaries and Subcommentaries have explicitly have explained these as

 given below.

 _Paccekkhakaranatthena ñātapariññā tīranapriññā ca gahitā hoti_ (_Sam.- T_. *ī.-*2: 65). are The meaning in the opening of. .t he above Commentaries and Subcommentaries

_Jānato_ = to the ones who know, _passato_ = to the ones who see. These two .w ords have similar meaning, the difference being in the wording. Though the two words of different structural pattern bear a similar meaning, _jānato_ refers to the one having ability to understand the nature of concentration rightly and penetratively. Indeed, _ñā_._n_ _a_ (knowledge), i.e., _sammādhitthi ñā_._n_ _a_, possesses the character of understanding the true nature of concentration penetratively.

_Passato_ refers to the ones who see the true nature of concentration by the power of _ñā_._n_ _a_. Indeed, _ñā_._n_ _a_ (_sammāditthi ñān_. _a_) is endowed with the power of seeing the true nature of concentration. As the form and figure are seen by one through the sense of physical eye (cognition by sight), so also the ones with _sammād_. _itthi ñāna_ s. ee the true

 nature of concentration through the light shone by the ñāna (_Sam.-Tha_.-2: 49).

_No ajānato no apassato_. To him who knows not and sees not [craving for the five aggregates, the nature of suffering due to these, and *atthiñgama* (disappearance)] I do not preach the _Ariya Magga Phala_ (Noble Path), the terminus of _āsava_. This is the concept of what has been said above. By the concept of _No ajānato no apassato_, those who see not and know not, still in the sphere of rounds of rebirth, are p. reaching the freedom from rounds of rebirth. Such individuals must be disregarded (_Sam_.-_Tha_.-2: 49).

Again the Venerable Sayadaw explained the concept of the above in three ways:

**1. _No ajānato no_** **_apassato_** = to him who knows and sees.

In these two, “sees” should be taken philosophically as to see with eye of wisdom. _Mansa cakkhu_ (_pasāda cakkhu_), the sight through physical (or absolute) eye, should not be taken as its real meaning. Therefore, the two terms _jānato_ (he who knows), _passato_ (he who sees) have similar conceptual sense.

_Evum_. _santepi_ = The expression that “though these two words have different

structural pattern, of similar meaning” indicates _jānato_ = to him who knows, _passato_ = to him who sees, have same essence.

1. Concentration of the (_ñānalakkhana_ ) character of the knowledge which penetratively

 knows the nature of the obj..e ct.

2. The nature of knowledge (_ñānappabhāva_) which shed light so that the nature of the

object can be visualized. .

The sense of the nature of ability to see, as mentioned above, has been described by two different words because they do not oppose one another in their conceptual sense. Therefore, the commentator has stated _jānanalakkhanam hi ñānam_ = knowledge has the character of knowing the true nature of the object penetratively.

_Ñā_._n_ _appabhāva_ possesses the nature light which enables one to see the nature the object rightly by the light shed by the power of wisdom. (This is in concord with _visayobhāsarasā padīpodiya_ in the Commentary _Atthasālinī_ (_Abhi_.- _Tha_.-1:166). That is why the Commentator Sayadaw has expatiated _ñānena vivate dhamme passati_ = he who has _samāditthi ñāna_ (right of wisdom) can see the _dhamma_ by the shining light of knowledge (*Sam.-tī.-*2-63).

[N.B. The Light of Wisdom is treated on pp. ........... in this volume]

2. In another way _janato_ means he who knows by knowledge what has come in the past.
3. In another way _passato_ means he who knows by knowledge what is to come in

 future.

1. _Anussava_ (hearsay, report) via your teachers and parents you come to know by your knowledge
1. _Ãkāparitakka_ (study of condition, careful consideration) you come to know via your thought and logical reasoning.

 Just knowing by such knowledge is not applicable here. In fact, it is like just as visualizing corporeality’s by physical eye, the following should be visualized by eye of wisdom:

(i) _Rūpa_ (material quality), _vedanā_ (suffering), _saññā_ (perception), _sankhāra_

 (impermanence), _viñañ_ (cognition)--the five aggregates. as object.s of grasping,

 (ii) The origin of the cause of arising and the nature of these five aggregates as objects of grasping,

(iii) The cause and nature of cessation of these five aggregates = the nature of _udaya_ (disappearance or destruction).

To make visualizing the above three more explicit, note that the Buddha preached _passato_ = to him who sees to stress the point that only he who see. s by his own eye of wisdom through _paccekkha ñā_._n_ _a_ or the practical knowledge (_Sam_.-_Tī_.-2: 63).

**_Anussava_ and _Ãkāparitakka_**

Here _anussava_ and _ākāparitakka_ are once again explained.

-   .

_Anu anu savanam **anussavo**_\*\* (_Sam. Tī_.-2: 166).

_Pramparāgatassa evum_. _kirassāti_ **_anussavanam_**. (_Sam_. _. Tī_.-2: 317).

The knowledge handed down from the parents, grand and great grand parents and the teachers = what you know is termed as _anussava_. In this _Upanissa sutta_ **_janato_ =** to him who knows**, _passato_ =** to him who sees are indicated not for those who just know, by his knowledge handed down from his forefathers and teachers, the five aggregates of grasping, the cause and nature of cessation of these five aggregates = the nature of _atthiñgama_ (disappearance or destruction). This kind of knowledge does not represent the knowledge of eradication of factors of _āsava_.

.

**_Ãkāraparisakkoti yuttiparikappanā_** (_Sam. T_. _ī_.-2: 317).\*\*

Thinking, reasoning and analysis of the logic of factors is referred to as _ãkāraparisakka_. In _Upanissa sutta_ too _janato_ = to him who knows, _passato_ = to him who sees do not refer to the one who just know by knowledge of _ãkāraparisakka_. [Lord Buddha’s *dhamma* are not a field of *atakkāvacara* (impractical) *takkīs* (thinkers)] (Ma.-2: 291).

**_Paccekkha Ñāna_**

.

_Katamā ca bhikkhave sammādotthi, yan kho bhikkave dukkhe ñānam, dukkha_ _samu_._d_ _aye ñān_. _am_. _, dukkha nirodhe ñānam_._,_ _dukkha nirodhagāminiyā patipadāya ñāna_._m_ _._ .\*

_Ayam vuccati bhikkhave sammādi_._t_._t_ _hi_ (*Ma.-*1: 88).

_Bhikkhus_ .... what is _sammāditthi_ ? (right understanding) _Bhikkhus_ .... There is

1. The knowledge in understanding the _Dukkha Saccā_ (Noble Truth of Suffering)
1. The knowledge in understanding the _Samudaya Saccā_ (Noble Truth of Arising) the cause of _dukkha_ (suffering)
1. The knowledge in understanding the _Nirodha Saccā_ (cessation of suffering)
1. The knowledge in understanding the _Magga Saccā_ (Noble Truth of Path), cessation of suffering which leads of _Nibbāna_. _Bhikkhus_ .... such a kind of knowledge is the

 _Sammādi_._t_. _thi ñā_._n_ _a_ (_Ma_.-1: 88; _Mahāsatipathānasuttan_).

Relevant to the above _desanās_ there are _Catusaccasammādithi_, four _Sammādithi_ _ñāna_ (Four kinds of knowledge of rig..h t understanding). This knowledge is referred to as _Pa_._c_ _cakkha ñāna_ (the practical knowledge). In this _suttan_ only those who know and see by virtue of _Pa_._c_ _cekkha ñāna_ are the ones qualified for _jānato_ = he who knows, _passato_ = he who sees. .

1. The five aggregates as the object of grasping
1. Their impermanent nature
1. The nature of their disappearance

The preaching has been made of the Noble Path and Fruition, where factors of _āsava_ have ceased, for those who know and see the above three by means of their practi- cal knowledge.

Hence, those seeking cessation of the cause of _āsava_ (cankers), the _Ariya Magga_ (the Noble Path) should first try to see the following three penetratively through practical knowledge, called _Sammāditthi ñān_. _a_ (the knowledge of right understanding):

1. The five aggregates as the object of grasping
1. Their impermanent nature
1. The nature of their disappearance

It must be noted that one should first try to be able to know and see penetratively through the right understanding, ( as mentioned above) called practical knowledge, the object one is after.

Now once again the five aggregates as the object of grasping, their impermanent nature the nature of their disappearance, will be explained one by one.

**What _Upādānakkhandhā_ Is**

**The five aggregates as the object of grasping**

_Y_._a_ _m kañci bhik_. _khave rū_._p_ _am_. _atītānā_._g_ _atapa_._c_ _cuppanam_. _ijjhattam_. _vā bahiddhā vā olārikam vā_.\* _sukh_._u_ _mam vā hīnam vā panītam vā yam_ ._d_ _ure santike vā sāsavum_

_upādāniyam, yam vuccati rūpupādānakkhandho_ (_Sam_.-2: 39; _Khandhsuttan_).

With _tahnā ditthi_ (wrong understanding), whence _āsava_ factors (resident in the 31 planes) arise , the clinging like “I”, “mine” -- including

1. All the _rūpa_ (material factors) of the past
1. All the _rūpa_ factors of the future
1. All the _rūpa_ factors of the present
1. All the internal _rūpa_ factors
1. All the external _rūpa_ factors
1. All the gross _rūpa_ factors
1. All the delicate _sukhuma rūpa_ factors
1. All the inferior quality _hina rūpa_ factors
1. All the Noble _pan_. _īta rūpa_
1. All the _dhūra rūpa_ (away from the knowledge of the meditating yogi)
1. All the _santika rūpa_ (close to the knowledge of the meditating yogi).

All the _rūpas_ (material bodies) existing on the basis of these 11 characters are the _rūpupādānakkhandhā_ (material body as the object of grasping).

expatiatSeidm (i*S*la*a*r*m*l.y .- e 2a:c 3h9 o)f. the following has to be under _rūpupādānakkhandhā_ has been

Eleven kinds of _vedanā_ factors as _vedanupādānakkhandhā_ (suffering as the object of grasping), 11 kinds of _saññā_ factors as _saññupādānakkhandhā_ (cognition as the object of grasping), 11 kinds of _Cetasika sankhāra_ (impermanent mental concomitants) factors as _sankhārūpakkhandhā_ ( mental concomitants as the object of grasping), 11 kinds of _viññāna_ factors as _viññupādānakkhandhā_ (perception as the object of grasping).

Therefore, as in the above-mentioned _Upanisa sutta desanā_ where _tahnā_ (defile-

ment), _ditthi_ (error or wrong view) the root of _āsava_, such as “I”, “mine”, which are based on the 11 characters called _rūpānakkhandhā_, the Buddha admonished

1. _Iti rūpam_ = this is _rūpa_ (corporeality or material body)
1. _Iti vedanā_ = this is _vedanā_ (suffering)
1. _Iti saññā_ = this is _saññā_ (perception)
1. _Iti_ _sankhāra_ = this is _sankhāra_ (impermanence)
1. _Iti_ _viññānam_.* = this is *viññānam\*. (modes of cognition)

In admonishing so, the question is which kind of knowledge did the Buddha refer to in ‘this is _rūpa_; this is _vedanā_; this is _saññā_; these are impermanent _cetasika_ ?

The answer to the above is as follows.

**_Iti rūpam -- Iti vedanā_**

 **Question**. The Lord Buddha instructed practicing bodies to repeatedly contemplate, culture and analyze the five aggregates as object of grasping and their nature, such as - this is _rūpa_, this is _vedanā_, this is _saññā_, these are _cetasika sankhāra_, this is _viññāna_ - by means of _sammāditthi ñān_. _a_ (right understanding). They the question may be asked as to how the practicing yogis would know the five aggregates as the object of grasping, and how would they concentrate by means of the _sammāditthi ñān_. _a_.

**Answer**. The following is the answer to the above.

1. This is the _rūpa_ (material body); this much is the nature of _rūpa_, no more no less than this. It is so because of the causes such as hot, cold, etc., _rūpasantati_ (continuity of the material body) of the past = possesses dissimilar to the _rūpasantati_ of the future = processes occurring in various forms called _rūppanasibhāva_ (the character of the _rūpa_) = assume the nature of impermanence

(general character common to all material qualities), twenty-eight sensitive material qualities and tangibility beginning with which _lakkhana_-_rasa_-_piccupathan-padatthan_

 (character-taste-reappearance-approximate cause), by which material qualities are

completely deduced by means of knowledge of right understanding = must concentrate to attain complete realization is meant here.

In “this is _vedanā_, etc.” too

2. This is _vedanā_, this much is the _vedanā_, no more _vedanā_ beyond this.
3. This is _saññā_ (physical cognition). R.
4. These are _cetasika_ and _sankhāra_. R.
5. This is _viññāna_, this much is the _viññāna_, no more _viññāna_ beyond this.
6. Nature of sensation of _vedanakkhandhā_ (suffering as object of grasping)
7. Nature of sensation of _saññakkhandhā_ (physical mode of cognition)
8. The nature of the cause and resultant formation of _sankhāranakkhandhā_ (imper- manent material qualities)
9. Each of the _sankhāranakkhandhā_ causes is capable of respective resultant formation
10. Recognition of different sensations of _vedanakkhandhā_ as suffering (_vedanā_) and

 _sukha_ (mentally pleasurable) etc.

3. Recognition of different sensations of _saññakkhandhā_ as _rūpa_ and _saññā_ etc.
4. Recognition of different sensations of _sankhārakkhandhā_ as _phassa_ (touch) and

 _cetanā_ (volition) etc.

5. Recognition of different sensations of _viññākkhandhā_ as _cakkhu_ (consciousness by

 way of sight) and _viññañ_ (material consciousness).

Beginning with these and the power of **_lakkhana, rasa, paccupatthan, padatthan_** the _saññā, vedanā, sankhāra_, and _viññāna_ are instructed to be separately analyzed and cultured. What it meant is that phenomena of _saññā, vedanā, sankhāra_ and _viññāna_ (mind-element) are all to be completely known by the knowledge of _sammāditthi_ (the right understanding) = concentrate to understand (_Dī.-ttha_.-2-53).

With reference to the explanations given by the above doctrines the practicing yogi has to

1. _Bhūtarūpa_ (formed corporeality), _upādārūpa_ (derived corporeality) etc. of the 28

species, _pathavī_ (earth), _āpo_ (water), _tejo_ (fire), _vāyo_ (air) and each of their respective _lakkhana_ (character), _rasa_ (taste), _paccuppatthan_ (reappearance), and _padatthan_ (proximate cause)

2. _Sukhavedanā_ (mentally pleasurable suffering), _dukkhavedanā_ (painful suffering),

_somanassa_ (mental ease), _domanassa_ (mentally painful), _upekkhāvedanā_ (suffering due to equanimity) and each of their respective _lakkhana_ (character), _rasa_ (taste), _paccuppatthan_ (reappearance), and _padatthan_ (proximate cause),

3. _Rūpasaññā, saddasaññā, gandhasaññā, rasasaññā, pholapphasaññā, dhammasaññā_

and each of their respective _lakkhana_ (character), _rasa_ (taste), _paccuppatthan_ (reappearance), and _padatthan_ (proximate cause),

\3. _Phassa, cetanā, ekaggatā, jīvita, manasikāra_ (intension), etc., 50 groups of _cetasika_ as species included in _sankhāra_ as object of grasping, and each of their respective _lakkhana_ (character), _rasa_ (taste), _paccuppatthan_ (reappearance), and _padatthan_ (proximate cause),

\5. _Cakkhuviññāna_ (consciousness by way of sight), _sotaviññāna_ (consciousness by way of hearing), _ghānaviññāna_ (consciousness by way of smell), _jihvāviññāna_ (cons- ciousness by way of smell), _manoviññāna_ (consciousness by way of mind) etc., and each

of their respective _lakkhana_ (character), _rasa_ (taste), _paccuppatt_._h_. _an_ (reappearance), and _padatthan_ (proximate cause).

The practicing individual has to concentrate and culture these by means of _sammāditthi ñāna_ to see and know the object penetratively. Only known and seen this way, such as

1. This is _rūpa_,
1. This is _vedanā_,
1. This is _saññā,_
1. These are _sankhāra_,
1. This is _viññān_. _a_

Only then the _yogāvacara_ is said to know and see. In doing so

_Cakkhumā viya cakkhun_. _ā rūpani_ (_Sam_. _.-t_._t_. _ha_.- 2: 49),

_Rdaūspsāannia vmi_._y_ (_aS caam_._k_ ._k_ ._Th_ _īu_.-_v_ *i*2*ñ*:_ñ_ 6*ā*3*n*)_e_._n_ _a rūpādīni tesam_.\* _ca samudayodike paccekkhe katvā_

In accordance with explanations given in Commentaries and Subcommentaries, as a man sees material objects by _cakkhu ñān_. _a_ so also a meditator, through the help of light shed by concentration and cultivation, cultivate these _dhamma_ penetratively and

maintained by _sammādi_._t_._t_ _hi ñān_. _a_ called _paccekkha ñān_. _a_.

Only knowing and seeing this way can the Noble Path and Fruit, where all the āsava ceased to exist, be attained. In so admonishing, the Buddha referred not to those who do not know and see penetratively by _sammādi_._t_._t_ _hi ñāna_ to eradicate all the factors of _āsava_ to attain the Path leading to _Ariya Magga_.

Following these doctrines, with due respect, this treatise titled “_NIBBANAGAMINIPAT_. _IPADÃ_” was written to include

1. Meditation and cultivation on the _rūpupādhānakkhandha_ (28 species of material qualities), included in the _upādānakkhandhā_ to attain _parama_._t_._t_ _ha_ (the ultimate truth) by

..

means of knowledge of right understanding (_sammāditthi ñāna_) referred to as _paccekkha ñāna_. How this is cultured is given in the Meditation Exercise on Corporeality. (see Vol. I).

2. Included in the _Pañcuppādānakkhandhā_ (the five aggregates as object of grasping) are _vedanapādānakkhandhā_ (feeling as object of grasping), _saññupādānakkhandhā_ (percep- tion as object of grasping), _sankhārūpekkhandhā_ (_sankhāra_ as object of grasping) and _viñānupādānakkhandhā_ (consciousness as object of grasping). These are meditated by _sammāditthi ñāna_ called _paccakkhan ñāna_ to attain the knowledge of _paramattha ñāna_.
3. This is referred to as Meditation Exercise on _Nāma_. This section is presented in Vol. II.

 The nature of _rūpa_ (material phenomenon), _nāma_ (mental phenomenon) and

elements of _paramattha_ (ultimate truth) are included in the _Pañcuppādānakkhandhā_ (the five aggregates as object of grasping). They are individually analyzed, concentrated and cultivated by the power of _paccupathan_ and _padathan_, and _sammāditthi ñāna_ called _paccakkhan ñāna_. This is referred to as _Lakkhanādicatukka_ (see Vol. IV).

In continuation, the second part of _Upanisasuttan_ given above*-- Iti rūpassa* _samudayo_. R. _Iti vinñānassa samudayo_--will further be explained.

In the opening of the Commentaries and Subcommentaries with reference to the above _Patisambhidāmagga_ the object of meditating\* instructions such as **\*Iti rūpassa** **samudayo\*** is as given below.

**Contemplation on the _Samudaya_ of _Rūpakkhandhā_**

1. Because of _avijjā_ (ignorance) the material quality born of _kamma_ is formed.
2. Because of _tahnā_ (craving) the material quality born of _kamma_ is formed.
3. Because of _upādan_ (grasping) the material quality born of _kamma_ is formed.
4. Because of _sankhāra_ (action of mind) the material quality born of _kamma_ is formed
5. Because of _kamma_ (action) the material quality born of _kamma_ is formed.

-   The nature of formation of material quality born of _kamma_.

6. Because of _citta_ (mind/thought) the material quality born of mind is formed.

-   The nature of formation of material quality born of mind.

7. Because of _utu_ (physical change) material quality born of utu is formed.

• The nature of formation of material quality of born of _utu_.

8. Because of _āhāra_ (nutrition/food) material quality of born of _āhāra_ is formed.

-   The nature of formation of material quality born of āhāra.

These are the objects of concentration. A broader treatment on this object of concentration is made, Vol. V, in section on _Vipassanā_, _and Samudayadhammānupassī_ in Method of Concentration on _Udayabbaya_ in a broader sense.

In the contemplation—because of ignorance material quality born of _kamma_ is formed—the distinct causal factor = due to distinct cause a distinct result occurs should be concentrated. This contemplating phenomenon is the _paccayato udayadassana_ = nature of _samudaya_ by way of cause = contemplating on the result due to the cause. Concentrating on the nature of the formation of material quality born of _kamma_ and that born of consciousness is the causal relationship called _khanato udayadassan_ = concentrating for a moment on the nature of _samudaya_ = concentrating on the formation momentarily.

In this contemplation too —

_Cakkhumā viya cakkhunā rūpāni_ ..... (_Sam. Tha_.- 2: 49).

_Rūpāni viya cakkhuvinānena rūpādīni tesam ca samudayādike paccakhhe katvā dassanam_ (_Sam. Tī.-_ 2: 63*)*.

According to these teaching—like a man seeing material bodies by physical cognition so should a practicing individual (_yogāvacara_ or a meditator) be contemplating on these factors by the knowledge through which these are appreciated penetratively via _sammāditthi ñāna_ called _paccekkha ñāna_.

To be able to do so a meditator should have cultivated the following:

1. The respective causes of _avijjā_ (ignorance), _tahnā_ (craving)_, upādan_ (grasping)_,_

_sankhāra_ (mental action), _kamma_ (action) etc.

2. _Rūpa_-_vedanā_-_saññā_-_sankhāra_-_viññāna_, the resultant factors.
3. Because these causes, the respectively results distinctly occur, and the nature of

cause-effect correlation.

(These belong to the knowledge of _Nāma-rūpapariccheda_ and of _Paccayapriggaha_) (insight knowledge or analytical knowledge of mind and matter, and the knowledge of causal relationship).

Only those _yogāvacara_ (meditators) who have cultivated these knowledge of _Nāmarūpapariccheda_ and of _Paccayapriggaha_ will be able to concentrate on the _sammudayadhammānupassi_ (repeated recollection of _sammudaya dhamma_). Therefore, this meditation has been explained by the Sayadaw in section on _Udayabbaya ñāna_ by

 Commentary of _Visuddhi Magga_ (see _Visuddhi_ - 2: 266).

In this contemplation _avijjā, tahnā, upādān, sankhāra, kamma_ are the real causes of the present _rūpa_ and _nāma_ factors of the five _upādānakkhandhā_, included in the _vipākā_ _vatta_ (function of the effect of one’s actions). As to when these causes made their appearance, the following extracts from _Patisamb_. _hidā Magga_ will give the answer.

**Extracts from _Pa_._t_ _isambhidā Magga_**

**The Past Five Causes**

_Purimakammabhavassamem_. _moho avijjā, āyūhanā sankhārā, nikanti thnā, mupeamg_. _aidmhaan paam_._t_. _i_ _usapmāddāhniyaām_ ._p_ _, accectaanyāā_ _b_(_Phaavtiostaim im._-5*e* 0*p*)_a_. _ñca dhammā Purimakammabhavassa-_

_Tattha_, **\*purimakammabhavassamen**ti purime kammabhave, atītajātiyam kamma- bhave kriyamāneti attho* (*Abhi.-ttha.-*182; *Visuddhi\*-2: 214).

During previous life, when _kamma_ (a cause), called _kammabhava_ (active func- tioning of life in relation to the past) was cultivated

1. Nature of the wrong notion of the Four Noble Truth, and of male, female,

individuality, sentient being, human being, _devā_, brahmā etc., are all _avijjā_ (ignorance).

2. Human life = man’s material body = *devā*s' material body, and the factors that cause

appearance of these, _kusala_ (good deed), _akusala_ (bad deed) (done with _mettā_ or without _mettā_) are all _sankhāra_ (arising, action of mind).

3. Human life, life of _devā_ etc., and the nature of attachment to these material _kamma_

are all _tahnā_.

4. The nature of attachment mentally upon these life and material _karma_ all belong to

_upādan_ (derived from grasping).

5. Such _kuso cetanā_ (meritorious action) or _akuso cetanā_ (non-meritorious action) all

mean _bhava_ (rounds of rebirth).

 (_Kammabhava_ = _kamma_, action. In concentrating on _vipassanā_ (insight), effort must be made of _cetanā_(volition). In concentrating on cause-effect correlation, effort must be made of _kammasatti_ (potent action) = _kamma_ (action).

In this way, if _kammabhava_ (active life) of the past life = if _kamma_ is distinctly present, these five that have appeared = that are making their appearance then these five

 _dhamma_ are the five corporeality of the rebirth in the present life (_Patisam_.-50).

In these five causal factors _avijjā_, _tahnā_ and _upādan_ are the consequences of craving. _Sankhāra_ and _kamma_ are the consequences of the action. These are the five past causes. Because of these five past causes the following five present results have appeared. These results are the _vipākavatta_ (function of effect of one’s action).

**The Five Species of Present Resultants**

_Idha patisandhi viññānam_, _okkanti nāmarūpam, pasādo āyatanam_, _phattho phasso, vedayitam vedanā, ime pañca dhammā idhūpapattibhvassamem purekatassa kammassa paccayā_ (_Patisam._-50).

In the present life

1. The nature of connection, liability to connect, of a past life with the present one,

the _patisandhe citta_ (rebirth consciousness), or _vipāka citta_ (consciousness of consequences of one’s action) is the _viññāna_ (mental cognition).

2. The nature of entrance into mother’s womb is the _nāmarūpa_ (mind and matter).
3. _Pasāda_ (clearness or clarity) like _cakkhu_ (sight) etc. are the _sal_._ā_ _yatana_ (sense

objects).

4. Nature of contact as object or liable to make contact is the _phassa_ (Contact).
5. The nature of or factor of feeling of the object as concentration is the _vedanā_ \*
    (suffering).

In this way in the present life if there is _jāti_ (birth), called the _upapattibhava_ (resultant way of next life), the these five _dhamma_, which have appeared and the appearance completed, are the results of the _kamma_ cultivated during previous existence (_Patisam_.-50).

**The Five Species of The Present Causes**

_Idha paripakkattā āyatanānam moho avijjā, āyūhanā sankhāra, nikanti tahnā, upagamanam upādānam, cetanā bhavoti ime pañca ghammā idha kammabhavassamem_

 _āyattem patisandhiyā paccayā_ (*Patisam.-*50).

In the present existence, due to maturity of _Ãyatana_ (groups of sense objects)

1. The nature ignorance of the Four _Sacca_ (the Four Noble Truth), wrong concept of

being male, female, individuality, animals, human, celestial *devā*s, brahmmā etc. are all _avijjā_.

2. The appearance of five corporeality like human life = material human body, life of

celestial being = material body of celestial being, etc. and the factors, which make these appear, such as _kusala_ and _akusala_ (actions meritorious or not) are all _sankhāra_.

3. The nature of clinging to these material _kamma_ (material bodies) are all tahnā

(desire).

4. The nature of attachment mentally to such _kamma_ bodies and _kammavatthu_ is

_upādan_ (grasping).

5. Such and such _kusocetanā_ (meritorious volition) or _akusocetanā_ (non-meritorious

volition) means _bhava_ (life/ a form of rebirth). (_Kammabhava_ = _kamma_).

In this way if these five categories are present as _kammabhava_ (sensual existence) in the existing life, there occurs rebirth as the resultant (_Patisam_.-50).

[Note. In the present life incident *āyatana* mind is enjoyable, but mostly unable to create a *bhava* resulting from effort to produce a new life during preceding one. So the Buddha preached stressing the point of maturity of *āyatana dhamma*].

**The Five Future Resultants**

_Ãyatem patisantdhi viññānam, okkanti nāmarūpam, pasā āyatanam, phuttho phasso vedayitam vedanā, ime pañca dhammā upapattibhavassamem idhakatassa kammassa paccayā_ (*Patisam.-*51).

1. Rebirth consciousness, in other words rebirth consciousness, which has the nature

or tendency to again relate a present life with a previous one is the mental factor.

2. The nature of formation as in conception in the maternal interior is the _nāma_-_rūpa_

mind and material factor).

3. Visual feeling is the _sa_._l_ _āyatana_ (sense as object)
4. Nature of contact as object or liable to make contact is the _phassa_ (Contact).
5. Nature of enjoyment in senses, and categories of sensation is the _vednā_ (suffering).

Therefore in future life, if there is _upapattibhava_ (resultant way of next life) called _jāti_ (birth), these five categories would be derived from the previously cultivated _kamma_ (_Patisam_.-51).

**Classification of Period**

In this _paticcasamuppāda_ (cause-result relationship) _desanā_ are 12 categories: _avijjā, sankhāra, viññāna, nāma-rūpa, sal_. _āyatana, phassa, vedanā, tahnā, upādan, bhava, jāti, jaramarana_.

These 12 categories, as instructed by _Patisambhidāmagga_ (Analysis of Path in _Pāli_) the period have been recognized by _Abhidhammatthā Sañgāha_ (the collection of

 doctrines) as given below.

_Avijjā sankhāra atīto addhā, jāti, jarāmaranam anāgato addhā, macche attha paccuppanno addhā_ (_Abhiddhammattha sañgaha_ - 132).

_Avijjā_ and _sankhāra_ are the categories of the long past period. _Jāti_ (rebirth), _jarāmarana_ (decay, death) are the categories of the period to come (future period). In between these two are _viññāna, nāma-rūpa, salāyatana, phassa, vedanā, tahnā, upādan,_ _bhava_ (= _kammabhava_), the categories of the present period (_Abhiddhammattha Sañgaha_ - 132).

The 12 factors of _Paticcasamupāda_ are classified by the periods with the present existence placed midway between the past and the future. This is the doctrine indicating the repetition and correlation between each of the 12 factors of _Paticcasamupāda_. Similarly the contemplation can be made, as much as possible, the repetition and correlation between on the individual factors of the _Paticcasamupāda_ by concentrating the mind on the past and future _bhava_.

_Atītepi paccayā ceva paccayasamuppannadhammā ca, anāgatepi etarahipi paccayā_ _ceva paccayasamuppannadhammā ca_ (_Abhi.-Ttha_.- 2: 242).

1. In the past too, there are only the phenomena of causes and results.
1. In the future too, there are only the phenomena of causes and results.
1. In the present too, there are only the phenomena of causes and results.

Relevant to the explanation given by the above _Sammohavinodanī Athhakathā_ (Commentary on Dispelling of being Infatuated), to know that on the past also there are factors of cause and result, the cause and result of two or three previous lives should be cultivated.

**_Ekadesato jānitabbam_**

_Vipassakena pana kammantarañca ekadesato jānitabbam_ (_Visuddhi_ - 2: 237).

**\*Ekadesato jānitabbam** anavasesato jātitum na sakkā avisayattā*. *Sabbena sabbam ajānane paccayapriggaho na paripūrati* (*Mahādī -\* 2: 380).

 _Ditthadhammavedanīyakam_ = action fruitful in the present life, _upapajjavedanīyakam_

-   action that is going to be fruitful in the second life, _aprapriyavedanīyakam_ = action that will be fruitful from third life to the attainment of _Nibbāna_ etc. _Kamma_ (action) are of various kinds. Among them

A meditator exercising on _vipassanā_ (insight) should know in part with considerable strength or weakness in _kamma_ called _kammantara_ (_kamma_-formation); _kamma_ of different categories, of inferior quality or superior quality results of actions, cleanliness or not of mental actions so-called mental formation. These are _ekadesa_ = in part which are to be mentally cultivated. The disciples are unable to attain complete accomplishment of these _kammantara_ and _vipākkantara_ (Fruit-formation). It is so because these are not the affairs of _sāvakas_ (disciples), but are only of the omniscience and perfectly enlightened ones, _Sabbññañusammāsambhuddha_.

If the _kammantara_ and _vipākkantara_ (factors of cause and results of _kamma_), then the knowledge of acquiring the cause or result referred to as _paccayapariggaha_ _ñāna_ (knowledge based on acquisition) will never be accomplished (_Visuddhi_- 2 - 237; _Mahādī_ -2 - 380).

A _yogāvacara_ individual (a meditator) meditating on the _kamma_ and its results by _sammāditthi ñāna_ on the _kamma_ and its results by _sammāditthi ñāna_, especially on the fact that due to cultivation surrounded by _avijjā, tahnā_ and _upādan_ in the past, the rebirth nāma-rūpa, the resultant _vipāka_ of the present are formed. In such way of cultivation, the question arises as to should one be contended with what has been acquired by hearsay from one’s teachers? The answer follows.

_Ñānasama_. _ñgī puggalo cakkhumā viya cakkhunā rūpāni, ñānena viv_._a_ _te dhamm_. _e_ _passati_ (_Sam.-ttha_.-2:49).

**\*Jānato**ti vā vattvā na jānanam anussavākāraprivitakkamattavasena idhādhippetam, atha kho rūpāni viya cakkhuviñānena rūpādīni tesan ca samudayādike paccakkhe katvā dassananti vibhāvetum “**passato**”ti vattanti evum vā ettha attho (Sam.-T*. *ī\*.-2: 63).

Satisfaction with the knowledge of hearsay, heard and taught by the teacher is what you know = hearsay knowledge and is unacceptable here. The fact that just knowing by thinking on the basis of the prevailing state (or condition), such as “This could be it. This could it”, is just your own knowledge acquired through thinking. Such a knowledge also is not acceptable here. Indeed, what is acceptable is that just as seeing a material body through the physical eye, so should a _yogāvacara_ (meditator) see by the light of _vipassanā_ insight called _paccaya pariggaha_ knowledge. By means of the _vipassanā_ insight, the _upādāna-kkhandhā_ (the five-fold clinging to the existence), the nature of the origin of _upādāna-kkhandhā_, the nature of its ceasing etc., should be known penetratively by the right understanding called the practical knowledge. Here such a knowledge as _dassana_ = knowledge, sight, only is acceptable (_Sam.-Tha_.-2-49; _Sam.-tī_.- 2-63).

**Could We Know and See This Way**

As a disciple, could a meditator know, penetratively by insight knowledge, the categories of action of mind cultivated with _avijjā, tahnā_, and _upādan_ of the past rebirth material, cause the derived resultant of the present appear? It is a question made by those of good deed would like to know the answer. If you are not contended, then continue on the following.

**_Nibbatti Passitabbā_**

Those _yogāvacara_ individuals who have acquired analytical knowledge of mind and matter and familiar with the knowledge analytically, should contemplate concentra- ting on the _nāma-rūpa,_ _sasnkhāra dhamma_ and their causes with emphasis on the three properties of existing things. In so exercising the _vipassanā_ Patisambhidāmagga instructed the concentration to be made so that _nibbatti lakkhanā_ (properties of formation) is apprehended in your mind (_Patisam_. - 53: 54). With regard to the _nibbatti lakkhanā_

Commentary on _Patisambidā_ give the following three expiations.

**\*Nibbatti lakkhanan**ti addhā-santati-khanavasena rūpassa uppādam, uppādoyeva sañkhatalakkhanatta lakkhananti ca vutto (Patisam*-*Tha\*- 1: 235).\*\*\*

_Nibbatti_ is of three categories: _addhānibbatti_, _santatinibbatti_, _khananibbatti_.

1. In a lifetime from birth to death the properties of _rūpa_ and _nāma_ (the material and

mental properties) are the groups of the present factors. The nature of appearance of these properties is the _addhānibbatti_ (present formations).

2. The material and mental properties within a series of form and of mind are the

groups of the present. The nature of formation of these true factors of the present is the **_santatinibbatti_** (continuity of forms).

3. Three species of _khana_ (moment) such as _upāda_ (the arising) - _thī_ (the static) - _bhin_

(perishing away), which are included in the mind and material qualities, are the categories of the _khana_ (momentary) present. The nature of formation of the _khana_- present **_khananibbatti_**.

4. Furthermore, Commentary on _Visuddhimagga_ recommended that contemplation

must be made of the appearance again and again of _kammajarūpa_, derived from _kamma_, from birth*khana*. This is **_kammatanibbatti_**. Similarly the formation of thought moment due to mind, of physical change, and of food are to be known and visualized by concentration through _vipassanā ñāna_. Characteristic of _nibbatti_ (material body), relentless formation and destruction, and their character formation called _nibbattilakkhana_ (character of rising) should be cultured by _vipassanā_ method of concen- tration (_Visuddhi_ -2-249-252).

5. Again, through the _kamma_ (action) of the long past life from rebirth mid to the

originof the phenomenon of mind, the features of _nibbatti_ during formation, coincidence of mind doors, the causes due to which phenomena of mind start to appear—the features of _nibbatti_—are to be contemplated by _vipassanā_ method (_Visuddhi_ -2: 252-253).

**A Brief Instruction to Meditation**

... _kālena rūpam sammatitabbam, kālena arūpam. Rūpam sammasantena rūpassa nibbatti passitabbā. Seyathidam--idam rūpam nāma kammādivasena catūhi kāranehi nibbatti. Tattha sabbesam sattānam rūpam nibbattamānam patthamam kammato_

_nibbatti. Patisandhikkhaneyeva hi gabbhaseyakānam tāva tisantivasena vatthu-kāya-_

_bhāvadassakasankhātāni temsarūpāni nibbattanti, tāni ca kho patisandhicittassa uppādakkhaneyeva. Yathā ca uppādakkhane, tathā thitikkhanepi bhangakkhanepi ..._ (_Visuddhi_ 2: 248-249)\*

_Yathā ca rūpam sammasantena rūpassa, evum arūoam sammasantenapi arūpassa nibbatti passitabbā. Sā ca kho ekāsīti lokiyacittuppādavasena. Seyathidam -- idahñi arūpam nāma pūrimabheva āyūhitakammavasena patisamdhiyam tāva ekūnavīsati- cittuppādappabhedam nibbatti_ (*Visuddhi-*2: 252).

_Nibbatti passitabbā_ — from the time of rebirth to throughout life time formation material and mind called the nature of _nibbatti_ is to be contemplated — means contem- plation should be made by always following the doctrines by knowledge of _anumāna_ = inference should be contemplated. Following such an incessant concentration, meditation becomes impinged on the mind = concentration may also become fruitful by contemplat- ing practical knowledge (_Mahātī_-2: 399).

This knowledge of inference is the one formed during the past. A disciple should not be contended with this knowledge only. In fact contemplation should be made to

 attain the next step, _paccakkha ñāna_ (the practical knowledge).

This means that if a meditator, who has attained _sammā ditthi_ (the right understanding), starts to exercise concentration on the material body, the nature of each of the Four Great Elements are to be concentrated

1. The nature of hardness of the Earth-element.
1. The nature of flowing and cohesion of the Water-element.
1. The nature of the hotness of the Fire-element.
1. The nature of the support of the Air-element.

Suppose natural phenomena of the Four Great Elements are cultured to start with. As soon as they are cultivated, it will be very hard to concentrate and culture on the material features and the natural phenomena of each element of the Four Great Element by penetrative mental quality. These individual phenomena, called the nature of ultimate reality can, however, be cultured if the meditator is of the status of _Ariyas_ (the Noble Ones) like the Venerable _Sariputtara_ and the Venerable _Bahiyadārūciriya_.

Within each group of _rūpakalāpa_ (a combination of material bodies) are the natural phenomena of their own of the Four Great Elements. Following the instructions given by the doctrines, the natural phenomena, such as the nature of hardness, flowing, hotness and support are to be exercised and cultured by the knowledge. In doing so, the meditator, whose ñāna (knowledge) has not as yet arrived at knowing the natural phenomena of the Four Great Element called the _paramatta_ (the ultimate truth) could still not split the bulk of such _rūpa_ or the aggregates of material bodies (referred to as _santatighana_ = continuity of the solid mass, _samūhaghana_ = obligatory solid mass, _kiccaghana_ = aggregated solid mass etc.). Therefore, his _bhavanā ñāna_ (knowledge of meditation) can only be exercised in the field of _santatipaññatti_ (notion of continuity of solid mass), _samūhapaññatti_ (notion of obligatory solid mass) and _kiccapaññatti_ (notion of aggregated solid mass).

These concepts (or notions), however, are the ones from which the _paramatta_, called the essence of element, can be derived. It is a concept of _pathavī kasin_. _a_ (circle of earth) perception derived from concentration on the circles of earth dispersed in the 10

directions, and it is not the _paññatti_ (notion) from which the ultimate reality of the element cannot be attained. Nor it is the space-circle from which the ultimate reality of the elements cannot be derived.

Since the perception of duration of the _santatipaññatti_ are still lingering on him, the meditator has to be exercising on the nature of the Four Great Element, such as hardness, flowing, hotness and support. While concentrating in this way, the knowledge of the mental culture is completely attained. Only then are the material character of the individual groups of the Four Great Element, called the ultimate real element can pene-

 tratively be cultured. (see Meditation on _Rūpa_ for detail).

Similarly when contemplation is made on the _nibbattilakkhanā_ (phenomenon of formation) too, the meditator should concentrate on the material and mental formation of rebirth due to the _kamma_ of the past, also due to the past _kamma_ the material and mental formations, included in _vipākavatta_, occurring throughout the life time, the nature of arising of material and mental formation of rebirth (nature of _nibbatti_), if the _bhāvanā ñāna_ is still immature, the meditator could not cultivate at once. According the Buddha’s desanā — there are 30 classes of _rūpa_ during the period of rebirth, 34 if it is _tihissomanassa_ (three-fold mental case) — by power of _anumāna_ knowledge which follows instructions in the doctrines, and the concentration is made by imagination. But the exercise should be continued until _paccakkhan ñāna_ (practical knowledge) is acquired.

In practicing by _anumāna_ (inference), at a time when _bhāvanā ñāna_ is till immature, _rūpa-nāma_ are cultivated in sequence directed towards the rebirth phenomenon. Because much emphasis was made on mental exercise in the field of _paññatta_ all along the _sansarā_. In such consciousness are included the mind-door impressions called conceptual attention, due to culture of which images of these conceptions sometimes appear in a practicing _yogi_ (_yogāvacara_). These aggregates are

due to present still of the concept of duration of compactness an..d. the configuration. These, however, are the ones from which the concept of essence of the element, referred to as the ultimate reality, can be derived. Since the meditator still has this conceptual knowledge of the compactness, massive, etc., he has to continue exercise on the Four Great Element. If successful, culture of mind and material qualities further can be made. Every time the image of the concept appears, this method has to be applied. If the exercise along this trend and mental culture matured, then the phenomenon of form from its origin to mind and material of rebirth will penetratively be visualized by mean of the _sammāditthi ñāna_, called the practical knowledge.

If the concentration is continued in this way, and the maturity of mental culture acquired surrounded by _avijjā, tahnā,_ and _upādam_ and be cultivated by means of these _avijjā, tahnā, upādam_ and _sankhāra_, mind and material of the rebirth, and the respective results of actions of mind and material, and the phenomena of _nibbatti_ will be visualized.

 (see section _Paticca samuppāda_ for more details).

In this meditation by penetrative practical knowledge appearance of the respective results of mind and material of rebirth _avijjā, tahnā, upādam_ and _sankhāra_ are the respective causes are _Paccayato udayadassana_ = method of contemplation on cause- result phenomenon of appearance of the mind and material formation, the phenomena of _upāda_ by penetrative knowledge is the _khanato udayadassana_ = contemplation on the momentary formation. (see section on _Udayabbayañāna_ for more detail).

**What Kind of Action Is It**

In concentrating so _Samyotta_, Commentary scriptures which describe _Upanisa suttan_ (*Sam.-Tha.-*2-49; *Sam.Tī.-*2-63) expounded as a man sees different kinds of _rūpāyon_ (visible material factors) by means of _cakkhu ñāna_ (knowledge of sight), so should a practicing yogi see mental and material causes, _pacñcānakkhandhā_ (the Five Corporeality), initiation of material body formation, phenomenon of the nature of _nibbatti_, due to the causes such as _avijjā, tahnā, upādam_ and _sankhāra_ etc., difference of respective results of mental and material form of rebirth, the nature of _samudaya_ should

 be seen penetratively by _sammāditthi ñāna_ called _paccekkha ñāna._

Only if one knows and sees this way and only he who knows and sees this way, can _Magga Ñāna_ (Path-Knowledge), where all the phenomena of _āsava_ (the fetters) have ceased, be attained is what the Buddha has expatiated in _Upani_ _Suttan_.

Again in the Commentary of _Visuddhi Magga_ (_Visuddhi_ 2-237) it has been indicated that an individual exercising on the _vipassanā_ insight should try to penetratively know, in part the formation and results of the mind and material forms, by means of the

 _paccekkha ñāna_ (practical knowledge).

Therefore, a Noble one, when culturing the causes of the Past, should concentrate in such a way that as different visual forms are recognized by the consciousness of visual perception so should _avijjā, tahnā, upādam_ and _sankhāra_ of the Past _kamma_ be acquired by the light of _vipassanā_ knowledge.

Among the sentient beings, one is different from another with regard to the _avijjā, tahnā, upādam_, the _sankhāra kamma_ also is different among individual beings.

Some wish to be a monk and so performed _karma_-formation in the Past to be reborn as a male. Such an action is surrounded by wrong-knowing as a “male” is _avijjā_ (ignorance), attachment to a male’s life _tahnā_ (craving), holding on to it mentally _upādan_ (grasping). Some wish to be female. Some wish to be a female and so performed _karma_-formation in the Past to be reborn as a female. Such an action is surrounded by wrong-knowing as a “female” is _avijjā_ (ignorance), attachment to a female’s life _tahnā_ (craving), holding on to it mentally _upādan_ (grasping).

In the same way, individuals are usually dissimilar in action of mind. Some meditating individuals enjoy more benefit from the action of alms offering, some from exercise in _sīla_ (virtue), and some from _bhāvanā_ (mental culture). In the alms offering action again, some benefit from donation of food, some from offering of flowers, and some from donation of robe. Similarly in the action of _sīla_, some are benefited from the

Five Precepts, some from Eight Precepts, and some from Ten Precepts. In mental culture too, some are benefited by _Ãnāpāna_ (in-breath and out-breath mental culture), some by _mettā bhāvanā_ (cultivation by mind of love to all living beings), and some by _kasinabhāvanā_ (mental cultivation of hypnotic circles). {Here special reference is made to _upācāra_ (approach), _kāmāvacara_ (world of pleasures), and _sammādhijo_ (concentra- tion)}.

In this way _kamma_ may differ among each other in the _yogāvacara_ (meditating individuals). They should concentrate and culture on the fact that _avijjā_ (ignorance), _tahnā_ (craving) and _upādan_ (grasping) differ, that due to such differences as the _avijjā, tahnā, upādam_ and _sankhāra_, the five aggregates of male, female, celestial being, brahma etc., arise. As such results with different forms are recognized by the sense of physical eye, so should they be mentally visualized and cultured by _sammāditthiñānacakkhu_ (the right understanding eye of wisdom) called the _paccakkhañānacakkhu_ (eye of practical knowledge). Only known and seen this way, then — _itirūpam samudayo_. R. _Itiviññānassa_ _samudayo_ — _Samudaya_ as the object of contemplation will be acquired, as given in _Upanisa Suttan_.

**Stop a While and Ponder**

Suppose you the noble one are at the age of 60. Your mind and matter of rebirth are the mind and matter of the five aggregates of the object of grasping when you began as a conceptus within your mother 60 years ago. Initiation of these mind and matter of rebirth, the nature of _nibbatti_ = nature of the causes are to be cultured by the

 _paccakkhanñāna_, as instructed in the Commentaries and Subcommentaries.

Again these mind and matter of rebirth etc. of the five aggregates, grasping which are functions of the effect of your action caused by _avijjā, tahnā, upādam_ and _sankhāra_, and _kamma_, are also —

_Purimakammabhavassamim_ .... (_Patisam_.-50).

**\*Purimakammabhavassamen**ti purime kammabhave atītajātiyam kammabhave kariyamāneti attho* (*Abhi. ttha.-*2-182; *Visuddhi*-2-214).*

Such are the collections of _dhamma_ formed during the cultivation of _kammabhava_ in the Past, the Commentary and Subcommentary instructed.

The Lord in _Upanisasuttan_ preached that ....

Because of such conspicuous causes as _avijjā, tahnā, upādam_ and _sankhāra_, _dhamma_ respectively, the nature of formation of the five corporeality, initiation of the five material quality of rebirth, the _nibbattilakkhanā_ (the character of the formation) = nature of arising.

He who sees and knows by _paccakkhañāna_ can _Ariya Magga Phala_ (the Noble Path and Fruition), where all āsava factors no more exist, can be attained. He who does not see and know by the _paccakhhañāna_ cannot attain _Ariya Magga Phala_ (the Noble Path and Fruition), where all factors of _āsava_ have ceased. The nature of the formation of future result due to the present cause, the formation of such a cause, the nature of formation of the future results, called the nature of formation, should be concentrated in a similar way as above. {The Method of Contemplation is treated in detail in section on

_Paticca samuppāda, Vipassanā_ and _Udayabbaya Ñāna_}.

So you the noble one should consider whether or not the factors of the Past and Future or the causes and results involved in your Past and Future life be concentrated so

 as to know and see penetratively by _sammāditthi ñāna_.

**Mental Culture of the Past and Future by means of**

**_Anvaya Ñāna_**

_Anamataggoyam_. _bhikkhave sansāro, pubbā kot_._i_ _na paññāyati_ .... (_Sam_.-2: 121).

In accordance with these doctrines, a living being can recollect his past _sansarā_ journey sequentially by means of _ñāna_. But it is too long a journey to know the point of initiation. The formation (or arising) and disappearance throughout this journey of _rūpa- nāma sankhāra_ (the material and mental qualities), and their causes and results cannot be completely concentrated nor cultivated nor analyzed via _ñāna_ by a _sāvaka_ (a disciple).

_Dogho balāna sansāro, saddhammam_.\* _avijānatam_. (_Khu_.-1: 22; _Dhammapada_).

So long too is the future sansarā journey for humans without moral sense (foolish humans in short) who are still ignorant of the _dhamma_ of the nobles called the Four Noble Truth. The arising and disappearance throughout this journey of the _rūpanāma sankhāra_, and causes and results cannot be completely concentrated nor cultured nor analyzed, via _ñāna_, by a _sāvaka_.

Again during a life time _addhāpaccupanna_ (the long present) extending from the start of rebirth to death, _rūpanāma sankhāra_ that have been formed, and the causes and results cannot be completely concentrated nor cultured nor analyzed via ñāna by a _sāvaka_. This is because only _ekadesa_ = concentration, culture and analysis via ñāna can partly be made by the _sāvakas_.

Once again let me explain a little further. Along a life time from rebirth to death, a multitude of material bodies, that have been formed, forming and to be formed, are too many in the existence of a sentient being. Let alone those formed, in the forming and be formed, the material bodies during the continued existence as arising, static and perishing away states, all the material bodies of medium-sized human are, assumed on the basis of

knowledge, would be atom-sized particles of **_don_**. **_amattā_ = a quarter** of a unit in weight (_Visuddhi_-1-361). In each of these minute particles there always are the Four Element. But sāvakas cannot concentrate on each and every element contained in each particle. Only some element in some particles can be concentrated. Some _pathavī_ _dhātu_ (earth- element) can be captured in the concentration, but some are left out of it. Note that so also will be the _āpo dhātu_ (water-element), and _upādārūpa_ (the derived material bodies).

Similarly in a life time there will be a number of c*akkhuviññāna* = a number of _cakkhuviññānavīthi_ (process of _cakkhuviññāna_), and from among these a number of _cak_- _khuviññā_ = a number of _cakkhuviññānavīthi_ could have been collected by a _sāvaka_. A number of _cakkhuviññā_ = a number of _cakkhuviññānavīthi_ could have escaped a _sāvaka_’s collection. It should be noted that a similar phenomena occur in _sotaviññāna_ = _sotaviññānavīthi_.

In exercising _vipassanā_ on _nāma-rūpa_ called _addhāpaccuppanna_ (the long-period present), only a fraction of the whole can be cultivated, a larger fraction escaped the exercise and being cultivated.

In exercising _vipassanā_ on _nāma-rūpa_ called _addhāpaccuppanna_ (the long-period present), only a fraction of the whole can be cultivated by a meditator. Other fraction escaped the meditation. So also in concentrating on the Past and Future, some will be collected, but others escaped the collection. The _nāma-rūpa_ left uncollected become more and more in magnitude.

In the same way, in exercising on the cause-effect factors, only a small fraction will be collected. That which escaped collection becomes more and more. It is because the _sāvaka_ (disciple) can collect only a small fraction of _kamma-kamma_ results during

 that moment.

The Buddha is endowed with 12 _vipākas_ (consequences of action). For each vipāka a particular _kamma_ is present. Similarly, each _sāvaka_ during his life time must naturally have encountered many kinds of agreeable and disagreeable objects (_Itthārammana_ and _Anitthārammana_ respectively). Encountering agreeable objects is due to _kusalakamma_ (meritorious actions) of many a kind in the past. Encountering disagreeable objects is due to _akusalakamma_ (non-meritorious actions) of many kinds in the past. The objects _kamma_ and _kamma_ resultants cannot be completely concentrated by a _sāvaka_, because it is not their affair. The _kamma_-_kamma_ resultant which has been con- templated and cultured is very few. That on which no _vipassanā_ exercise and cultivation have been made have become a lot more and more.

The causes and results of the _rūpa_ and _nāma_ objects called _sankhāra_ objects that have been cultivated by _vipassanā ñāna_ (insight knowledge) and those which have been concentrated are referred to as **_dit_**.**_t_**.**_h_** **\*a** sankhāra dhamma* (*dhamma\* that have been seen). Those that have escaped collection are referred to as **_adit_**.**_t_**.**_h_** **\*a** sankhāra dhamma* (*dhamma\* that have not been seen), as used by Visuddhi Magga.

_Paccekkhato ditthassa ārammanassa_ .... (_Visuddhi_-2: 280).

When _sankhāra_ object is concentrated and visualized by _vipassanāsammādi_._t_._t_ _hi_ (right understanding insight) called _paccakkhan ñāna_ .... so was it explained in this.

_Visuddhi Magga_ Commentator Sayādaw also has explained this _di_._t_._t_ _ha dhamma_

as _sampatidi_._t_._t_ _ha_ = **_sampatiupa_**.**_t_**.**_t_** **\*hita** sankhāra dhamma\*, **_adit_**.**_t_**.**_h_** **_a dhamma_** as **_sampati_** **_adit_**.**_t_**.**_h_** **_a_** = **_sampati anupat_**..**_t_** **\*hita** sankhāra dhamma* (*Mahātī\*.-2: 442).

_Sampatiditthi_ (presently seen) = _sampatiupatthita sankhāra_ are the _sankhāra_ _dhamma_ which has bee.n. collected by _paccekkhana ñāna_ called _vipassanā ñāna_ (insight knowledge). _Sampati adittha_ = _sampati anupatthita_ (appeared after now) _sankhāra_ are groups of _sankhāra_ _dhamma_ which have escaped collection, and are not concentrated by _paccekkha ñāna_ called _vipassanā ñāna_. Such _sampati adittha_ = _sampati anupadittha_ _sankhāra dhamma_ which have escaped concentration are collected by _anvaya ñāna_. Contemplation by means of _anvaya ñāna_ of cause-result factors called _paccaya pariggaha_ _ñāna_ (knowledge founded on acquisition), has been explained in the Com-

mentary of _Visuddhi Magga_ as follows.

_So evum paccayato nāmarūpassa pavattem disvā yatthā idam etarahi, evum atītepi addhāne paccayo pavattittha, anāgatepi paccayato pavvattissatīti samnupassati_ (_Visuddhi_- 2-234-235).

_Sampaditthi_ (p..r esently seen) = _sampatiupatthita san_.._k_ _hāra_ are the _sankhāra_ _dhamma_ which have been collected by _paccekkha ñāna_ called _vipassanā ñāna_ (insight

knowledge). _Sampati aditthi_ (not seen presently) = _sampati anupatthita_ (appeared after now) are the groups of _sankhāra dhamma_ which have escaped collection, and not cultivated, by _paccekkha ñāna_ called _vipassanā ñāna_. Such _Sampati aditthi_ = _sampati anupatthita sankhāra dhamma_ which have escaped collection are concentrated by _anvaya_ _ñāna_. Contemplation by _anvaya ñāna_ of cause-results factors called _paccaya_ _pariggaha_

(_ñāna_ formation by acquisition) has been explained in the _Visuddhi Magga_ as

_So evum paccayato nāmarūpassa pavattem disvā yatthā idam etarahi_, _evum atītepi addhāne paccayo pavattitta_, _anāgatepi paccayato pavattissattīti samnupassati (Visuddhi-_ 2: 234-235).

_Pavattem disvāti etarahi pavattem disvā evumti iminā na kelanam sappaccaya bhavamattameva paccāma_._t_._t_ _ham, yādisehi paccayeti, tādisehi avijjādi paccayeheva atītepi pavatta_._t_._t_ _hati paccayasadisetāpi paccayāma_._t_._t_ _hāti da_._t_._t_ _habbam (Mahā_._t_ *ī-*2-313).

When the meditating monk penetratively knows and sees by _sammāditthi ñāna_ called the _paccakkha ñāna_ that _nāma-rūpa dhamma_ of the present are the results of _avijjā_, _tahnā, upādan, sankhāra, kamma_ etc.— “Just as the appearance of the present _nāma-rūpa_ are due to the cause like _avijjā_, etc.— in the past period too this _nāma-rūpa_ has come into being due to the causes of _avijjā_.” In the future also due to the causes like _avijjā_ etc. the _nāma-rūpa_ will appear. Contemplation has to be made repeatedly in this

 way by _anvaya_ _ñāna_ (_Visud_._d_ _hi_-2: 243; _Mahātī_-2: 237)

Because of past causes the present results are formed. Because of the present causes will the future results be formed. Only when such cause-effect relations have been concentrated by _paccakkha ñāna_, then those that have escaped the concentration are collected by methods based on _anvaya ñāna_. It should be noted that because of the past cause the present result is formed; because of the present cause the future result will be formed. And if these _dhamma_ are still unknown, unseen, and not concentrated at all via _paccakkha ñāna_, and so too is in the past-future contemplation. These are not the affairs of _anumāna_ (a guesswork). (For clearer and more information, see _Visuddhi_-2: 233, 235).

**An Insistence to a Meditator**

You noble one also—_paccaya pariggaha ñāna_ = a knowledge that can analyze and maintain the incidence of the result due to the cause, and when the knowledge has been cultivated, maintain the above causes and results of the past and future by means of anvaya ñāna. (Way of cultivation of the cause-result _dhamma_ is given in detail in

section on _Pa_._t_ _icca samuppāda_. Refer to that section if need be).

Concentration of _vipassanā_ by means of _anvaya ñāna_ will be described in the section on _vipassanā_. But before going to it the concept of the present as given in _Udayabbaya ñāna_ (knowledge of arising and disappearing) will be discussed.

In this _desanā_ from _avijjā_ to _pattibhava_ called birth (birth-rebirth existence), the characters of _paticca samupāda_ are all equally the present.

If the present life is analyzed by periods with characters of _paticca samupāda_ in the middle, then _avijjā sankhāra_ are _dhamma_ groups of former period. _Viññāna_, _nāma_- _rūpa_, _sa_._l_ _āyatana_, _phassa_, _vedanā_, _upādan_ and _bhava_ (_kammabhava_) are the _dhamma_ groups of the present period. _Upapattibhava_ termed _jāti_ are the _dhamma_ groups of the

 future.* These *dhamma\* are all equally included in the present.

As mentioned above — it must be noted that, in accordance with the opening of _Mahā_._t_ _īkā_ — _paccuppannarūpam nāma jātam khanattayapariyāpannanti attho_ (_Mahātī_.- 2: 419), reference is made to the period when the three _khanas_ (moments) are inclusive.

What it means is that it is true that this _avijjā_ (mentioned above) is the past period that has occurred in the past. {it refers only to the _avijjā_, the basic cause of _vipākavatta_ _dhamma_ of the _paccuppannabhava_ (the present life)}. This _avijjā_, however, when formed in the past was distinct as upāda-thī-bhin moments. At that duration, when the _avijjā_ was apparently occurring, it is only the present _dhamma_. The formation and disap- pearance of this present _avijjā_ must be contemplated by _udayabbaya ñāna_. This _ñāna_

is the _paccakkha ñāna_.

In the same way, due to causes such as _avijjā, tahnā, and upādan. sankhāra_, and _kamma_ cultivated in the present life (or due to _aparapariyavedaniya kamma_ cultivated during the past life, _upapattibhava_ termed _jāti_ (birth) that is to appear is the dhamma of the future period. This _upapattibhava_ is going to appear distinctly as _upāda-thī-bhin_ in the future. This _bhava_, in arising and static states, is also the present. The arising and perishing away of the present life is concentrated by the _udayabbayānussaya ñāna_.

It must be realized that the remaining _dhamma_ from _sankhāra_ to _upādan_ have been instructed to be taken as the present period.

**To Note What the Real Meaning Is**

In whichever period, the past, future or present, the _dhamma_ might have existed, still existing or going to exist, if _vipassanā_ is exercised on these to arrive at the _khanpaccuppanna_ (momentary present), the _dhamma_ you are concentrating at, _upāda_ (contibued formation), _bhin_ (continued perishing), the three characters are alternately

 concentrated to see through the _udayabbaya ñāna_.

 are to be contemplated as **_anicca_** (impermanence).

 “Corporeality of past ended in the past, never reaching the present as a continuation.

 Since it has the nature of ending and destruction, it is _anicca_.”

In the ways as above the past, future and present _dhamma_ are divisible by means of the long period, and it has been instructed to contemplate these by _kalapasammesa_

 (grasping groupwise) _ñāna_ named as _vipassanā_ (insight) (see _Visuddhi_-2-245).

As so instructed, the five _upādanakkhandhā_ = _āyatana_ (12 classes) = 18 _dhatu_, 12 characters of _paticca samuppāda_ etc., the ultimate reality of elements, are cultivated by a meditator as the past, future and present periods by means of _sammāsana ñāna_.

As the meditator is able to exercise _vipassanā_ by the power of _addhā_ of the period, _udaya_ (formation), (destruction = _vaya_) will already be seen by _Sammāsana ñāna_. Visualized this way, when a meditator has successfully acquired _sammāsana ñāna_ and reacged _udayabbaya ñāna_ stage, a series of _rūpasantati_ and _nāmasantati_, called a

series of _santati_, by the power of which arising (and disappearance) of _rūpa_ and _nāma_ are concentrated by _udayabbayanupassana ñāna_. Always by the power of _khana_ (moment)

-   _vipassanā_ is exercised arrived at _khanapaccuppanna._ These _sankhāra dhamma_ which are cultivated this way by the _vipassanā ñāna_ to arrive at the _khanapaccuppanna_ are the

_sampatiddhi_._t_._t_ _ha sankhāra_. The past and future _dhamma_ that have been left uncollected by the _vipassanā ñāna_ are the _sampatiadit_._t_. _ha sankhāra_ (_Visuddhi_-2-280; _Mahā_._t_ _ī_.-2-442).

When the meditator has completely concentrated the arising and disappearance _dhamma_ of the _santatidittha sankhāra_ by means of _udayabbayanupassanā ñāna_ referred to as the **_paccakkha ñāna_**, the past and future called _sampatidittha sankhāra_ are con-

 templated in continuation by _anvaya ñāna_ as instructed by the Commentary of

_Visuddhi Magga_.

What the above Commemtary and Subcommentary mean is as follows.

**The Five _Udaya Ñāna_ at _Rūpakkhandhā_**

(**The Rise in the Five Kinds Knowledge on Material Body**)

1. _Avijjā samudayā rūpasamudayo_,
1. _Tahnā samudayo rūpasamudayo_,
1. _Kamma samudayo rūpasamudayo_,
1. _Ãhāra samudayo rūpasamudayo_,
1. _Nibbattilakkhanam_ .... (_Patisam_.-53-54; _Visuddhi_-2-266).
1. Becasue of _avijjā_, the material body born of _kamma_ is formed,
1. Becasue of _Tahnā_, the material body born of _kamma_ is formed,
1. Becasue of _Kamma_, the material body born of _kamma_ is formed,
1. Becasue of _Ãhāra_, the material body born of _kamma_ is formed,
1. The nature of the formation of _rūpa_ (corporeality).

**The Five _Vaya Ñāna_ at _Rūpakkhandhā_**

**(The Fall in the Five Kinds of Knowledge on Material Body)**

1. _Avijjā nirodha rūpanirodha_,
1. _Tahnā nirodha rūpanirodha_,
1. _Kamma nirodha rūpanirodha_,
1. _Ãhāra nirodha rūpanirodha_,
1. _Viparināma lakkhanam_ .... (_Patisam_.-53-54; _Visuddhi_-2-266).
1. Because of cessation of _avijjā_, material body born of _kamma_ ceased,
1. Because of cessation of _Tahnā_, material body born of _kamma_ ceased,
1. Because of cessation of _kamma_, material body born of _kamma_ ceased,
1. Because of cessation of _Ãhāra_, material body born of _kamma_ ceased,
1. The nature of cessation of _rūpa_ = the nature of destruction.

In this way there are five kinds of _udayañāna_, five of _vaya ñāna_, which added to a total of 10 kinds of _udayabbaya ñāna_. In the five corporeality, therefore, there will be 50 kinds. (see Section on _Udayabbaya Ñāna_ of _Vipassanā_).

As the nature of each _udaya_ and _vaya_ are concentrated by _udayabbayanupassanā_ _ñāna_, 50 characters 10 for each corporeality, are indicated in _Patisamdāmagga_. In accordance with the method of cencentration described broadly above as —

“This is the cause of which the _rūpa_ is formed, This is the cause of which the _rūpa_ ceased,

So is the _rūpa_ formed,

And so the _rūpa_ is destructed, —

**_Paccayato udayabbayadassana_** = concentration on the fact that because of the nature of the cause, the result is formed, because of cessation of cause, the result ceases, _Khanato udayabbayadassana_ = concentration on the nature of cessation and destruction by the nature of the _upāda-thī-bhiñ_ called _paccuppannakhana_ of the _rūpa_-_nāma_. By these two methods of _udayabbaya_ on a broad base the arising and perishing away are concentrated and taken to heart.

“In this way this _dhamma_ which was not there formerly, may suddendly appear, arises and disappears.” To a practicing yogi, thsi knowledge will become espcially clear.

Therefore, in the concentration of practicing yogi who is exercising with the knowledge of _udayabbayadassana, paccayatoudayabbayadassana_, _khanatoudayabbaya_- _dassana_, by thess two phenomena, arising and perishing away of the five corporealty will become clear as

1. The Four Ultimate Truth,
1. The _Paticca_ _samuppāda dhamma_, the _paticca samuppanna dhamma_,
1. The four methods called _Ekatta_ method,
1. The Five _Aniccalakkhanā_ (The Five Impermanent characters etc. of the five characters (Visuddhi-2-267).

**A Note by Venerable Pye Sayadaw**

In a meditator, taking to heart this much, _udayabbaya ñāna_ cannot be attained yet. As that much of _udayabbaya_ are inconspicuous, they are vaguely guessed by _anumāna_. Because of this condition, it was comparatively indicated by “_Iti kirime dhammā_. R.

_Pa_._t_ _ivanti_” stated with reference not to _paccakkha_ but to _anumāna kira-saddā_ (presumptive faith).

In other words, by _nayadassana_ (for the purpose of seeing), the meaning was given this way. Firstly _udayabbaya_ of _paccuppanna dhamma_ (_dhamma_ of the present) are accomplished by _paccakkha_, and later this method is employed for the past and future (_Pye Visuddhimagga nissaya_, 5: 165).

This note by Venerable Pye Sayādaw is the translation of the the part contained in _Mahā_._t_ _īkā_ Vol. II (_Mahā_._t_ _ī_.-2: 423).

In this expression — In a meditator, taking to heart this much, _udayabbaya ñāna_ cannot be attained yet. As that much of _udayabbaya_ are inconspicuous, they are vaguely guessed by _anumāna_. Because of this condition, it was comparatively indicated by “_Iti_

_kir_._i_ _me dhammā_. R. _Pativanti_” stated with reference not to _paccakkha_ but to _anumāna kira-saddā_ (presumptive faith) — it was asserted that once the _udayabbaya_ of the _sankhāra dhamma_ have been seen by _paccakkha ñāna_, then these _dhamma_ are no more required to be concentrated presumptively by _anumāna ñāna_. This assertion was not satisfactory and, therefore, SubCommentator Sayādaw added a second method. The

 Venerable Pye Sayādaw explained the second method as:

In other words, by _nayadassana_ (for the purpose of seeing), the meaning was given this way. “Firstly _udayabbaya_ of _paccuppanna dhamma_ (_dhamma_ of the present)

are accomplished by _paccakkha_, and later this method is employed for past and future” .

According to this explanation, a meditator must first have cultivated as causes:

1. All the Five _Paccuppannakkhandhā_ (the Present Five Corporeality) are results of the causes such as _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādan_, _sankhāra_, _kamma_ etc..
1. The causes of _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādan_, _sankhāra_, _kamma_ etc. (when at the duration of _Arahattamagga_, the 4th Path), cessation which would never ever be formed again, the _anuppādanirodha_, due to which the five corporeality cease never ever forming again, the nature of _anuppādaniriodha_ (giving rise to cessation),
1. The arising and perishing away of the Five Present Corporeality, the _udayabbaya_ =

_nibbatti lakkhan_. _ā_, _viprin_. _āmalakkha_._n_ _ā_ —

are to have been cultivated by the _udayabbayanupassanā ñāna_ called _paccakhha ñāna_. Only after cultivation by the _paccakkha ñāna_, then the method of _anvaya ñāna_ is accepted as the method for exercising on the past and future _dhamma_. This _anvaya ñāna_ is the one that always follows _vipassanā ñàna_.

**To be Noted Carefully**

The opening of _Mahātīk_. _ā_ (Commentary) runs as — _Paccuppannadhammānam_. _udayabbayam_. _disvā_ .... (_Mahā_._t_ _ī_.-2: 423)

In the passage ‘After seeing the _udayabbaya_ of _paccuppanna dhamma_ —

1. Because of the distinct formation of the causes like _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _sankhāra_, _kamma_ etc. distinctly arise,
1. The cessation of the causes like _avijjā_, etc., by the nature of law of cessation, the

 resultant five corporeality cease,

(These two are phenomena of _paccayto udayabbaya_)

3. The arising of the _paccuppanna dhamma_ = _nibbatti lakkhanā_ = destruction = _viprināma lakkhanā_ (character subject to change)

(These two are phenomena of _khanato udayabbaya_)

_Paccuppannadhammānam_. _udayabbayam_. _disvā_ .... (_Mahā_._t_ _ī_.-2: 423)

In this passage remember that both the _paccayato udayabbaya_ and the _khanato_ _udayabbaya_ of the _udayabbaya_ are inclusive. Only when the two kinds _of udayabbaya_, have been cultivated by _paccakkha ñāna_ referred to as _udayabbayanupassanā_, then concentrate on the past and future by the same old method of _anvaya ñāna_. It is the traditional law in practice which has to be taken with respect.

Again _Visuddhimagga atthaka_._t_._t_ _hā_ (_Visuddhi_-2-249). In _rūpa nibbattipassa ākāra_ was instructed due to _sankhāradhamma_ cultured surrounded by _avijjā, tahnā, upādan_ etc. during the previous life, formation of mental properties of rebirth, along one’s lifetime, respective causes which result in mental properties of _bhava_ together with those of the

 six-door are concentrated by _vipassanā ñāna_.

Therefore, with reference to _paccuppannnadhamma_ note that from the material quality of rebirth, relevent properties of the five corporeality, are involved.

Therefore. when _vipassanā_ is exercised with the knowledge of the two kinds of _udayabbayadassana_ on the _paccuppannadhamma_, start is made from the Five Material Quality of rebirth. (see _Udayabbaya Ñāna_, Section on _Vipassanā_).

Now again concentration by _Anvaya ñāna_ in _Bhanganupassanā ñāna_ will be

described.

**How Contemplation is made by _Anvaya Ñāna_ in _Bhanganupassanā Ñāna_**

-   . .

_Attha vā so evum viratto yatthādi_._t_._t_ _ham sankhāragatam, tathā adi_._t_._t_ _hampi anvayañān_. _avasena nirodheti, no samudeti. Nirodhatova manasikaroti. Nirodhamevassa passati, nosamudayanti at_.._t_ _ho_ (_Visuddhi_-2:279).

**\*Evum viratto**ti evum bhangānupassārenā viratto. Yatthā dittham sampati upatthitam sankhāragatam nirodheti nirodham manasikaroti. Aditthampi atīnāgatam anvayañāna- vasena yatthā idam etarahi, etam itarepīti anuminanto nirodheti mansikatassāpi nirodham karoti, **no samudhetī**ti itthāpi eseva nayo, no samudayam manasikarotīti attho*.*

(_Mahāt_._ī_ .-2: 442).

_Attha vā_ = in a way. _Evum_. = this _bhanganupassanā_ is followed (= always follow this knowledge of _bhanganupassanā_), _viratto_ = lack of attachment. _So yogāvacara_ = that

m*ni*e*ro*d*d*it*h*a*a*to*m*r. .\* _m_ _Dainttahsaikma_ _r_=_o_ *t*s*i*e *y*e*a*n*t* *t*b*h*y*ā\*\* o=w ans siefl fc, e*s*s*a*s*n*a*k*ti*h*o*ā*n*r\* *a*w*g*a*a*s*t* *a*t*m*ak e=n _s_ t*a*o*n* *k*h*h*e*ā*a*r*rt*a*.\* _d_ _Thaatmthmāa_ =. *N*si*i*m*ro*il*d*a*h*rl*e*y*ti*.\* _Aditthampi_ = past, future and _sankhāra dhamma_ which are not seen. . _Anvaya ñān_. _a_

.

.

.

.

vasena = by power of analytical knowledge. (_Etarahi_ = at present. _Idam yatthā =_ just as this present and _sankhāra_ are seen). _Evum tatthā_ = in the same way. _Tampi_ = that past, future and _sankhāra dhamma_ that are not seen. _Evum sabhāvameva_ = so there is nature of cessation, destruction. _Iti_ = in this way. _Anuminanto_ = by comparison). _Nirodheti_ = _nirodham manasikaroti_ = _nirodha_ (cessation) is taken to heart. _No samudeti_ = no _samudayam manmasikaroti_ = _samudaya_ (passion) is not taken to jeart. _Nirodhatova_ = only by means of cesation. _Manasikaroti_ = taken to heart. _Asankhāragatassa_ = of that _sankhāradhamma. Nirodhameva_ = on only the cessation. _Passati_ = concentrated. _Samudayam_ = on _samudaya_. _No passati_ = not concentrated (_Pye Visuddhimagga_ _Nissaya_-5-207-208).

In other words, as the meditator who is free from evil influence, _raga_-free (lust free) is always directed towards the _bhanganupassanā ñāna_, not clinging on to the _sankhāra dhamma_ {by dissociating himself from _rāga_ for a considerably long period of time by _vikkhambhanapa_ (way of withdrawal from lust)}. Then cessation of all _dhamma_, that should be known and seen by _bhanganupassanā ñāna_, and the cessation taken to heart.

The past, future and _sankhāra dhamma_ are taken expectantly by power of _anvaya_ _ñāna_. As the present _bhanganupassanā ñāna_ called the present called _paccakhañāna_ enables the meditator to know and see the _sankhāra dhamma_, so also the past, future and the _sankhāra dhamma_ that have not yet been seen by the _bhanganupassanā ñāna_ called _vipassanā ñāna_ (insight knowledge) are to be taken to cease in the coming period. In this way the nature of cessation, the _nirodha dhamma_, whatever the case may, is taken to heart. The arising _samudaya_ is not taken to heart. By way of cessation = the cessation only is taken to heart. The cessation of the sum total of _sankhāra dhamma_ alone are

concentrated, but not the arising _samudaya_. All this is what the above _Pa_._t_ _isambhidā_ _Magga_ really means (_Visuddhi_-2:279; _Mahā_._t_ _ī_.-2: 442).

**_Ãrammananvāyena, ubho ekavavatthanā._** . _Nirodha adhimottatā_._,_ _vayalakkhan_. _avipassanā (Patisam._-55).

_Ãramma_._n_ _anvayena_ = as the object really seen presently is always followed. _Ubho_

-   the object presently seen and unseen. _Ekavavatthanā_ = division by means of the only nature of of arrested moment. _Nirodhe_ = at relentless cessation of the _sankhāradhamma_ called _khan_. _ikanirodha_ (momentary cessation). _Adhimottatā_ = being inclined to. _Esā_ = This is. _Vayalakkhana vipassana_ = mental exercise on the nature of destruction of the

 _sankhāradhamma_, or character of this destruction.

_Ñātanca ñānanca ubhoppi vipassati_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 278).

_Ãrammananvayena atto ekavavatthnā_ = _dhamma named ñāta, dukkha saccā, samudaya saccā,_ which have been prenetratively seen and known, _vipassanā ñāna_ named _ñāna_ (knowledge) {the socalled _lokīmagga saccā_ (the Right Path _Dhamma_ of ordinary world)}. As this _sankhāra_ object, known as _ñāta ñāna dhamma_, was always followed, and as one knows the perishing of the _paccuppannadhamma_ and the _sankhāra dhamma_ which is definitely seen by the knowledge of _anubanga ñāna_ so also the _sankhāra_ _dhamma_ of the past has perished. In future too they will perish. Concentration should well be made with the notion that these objects, the _dittha_ (seen) and _adittha_ (not seen) object, by _vipassanā ñāna_, are constinuously perishing away. This is the essence of the

 above descriptions. Indeed, the commentators of the early days have expounded as —

_Samvijjāmānahmī_. R. _Uggate_. (Vide supra)

_Samvijjāmānahmī_ = by means of _paccakkha_, by _paccakkha ñāna_ cultivated, the whole _paccupanna sankkhāra dhamma_ (= means the _dhamma_ that are seen). _Visuddha_- _dassano_ = especially clean, that which concentrate on the destruction of the _sankhāra dhamma_, the meditator who has the _bhanganupassanā ñāna_. _Tadanvayam_ = the _vipassanā ñāna_ which always follows _bhanganupassana ñāna_ directed at _paccuppanna_ of the perishing of _sankhāra dhamma_. Atīte = _sankhāra dhamma_ of the past, _anāgate_ = _sankhāra dhamma_ of the future. _Neti_ = reflects = makes it happen. _Sabbepi_ = entirely. _Sankhāraggatā_ = _sankhāra_ of the past, future and present. _Palokino_ = possesses the nature of perishing. _Kiniva_ = as to how it all happens = _suriye_ = As the sun. _Uggate_ = rises. _Ussavabandu_ = the now. _Palokatiiva_ = disappear (_Visuddhi_-2-280).

When a meditator, who especially has the clean _anubhangā ñāna_, concentrating on the perishing away of all the _paccuppannadhamma sankhāra_ by means of _paccakkhā ñān_. _a_ acquired through _paccakkha_ (practice), always following the _bhanganupassanā ñān_. _a_ for which _viassanā ñān_. _a_ is formed — as this _sankhāra_ object known as _ñāta ñān_. _a_ _dhamma_ was always followed, and as one knows the perishing away of _paccuppanna_

_dhamma_, the _sankhāradhamma_, which is definitely seen by the knowledge of _anubhanga ñān_. _a_, so also the _sankhāradhamma_ of the past perished. The all complete past,, future and present _sankhāra dhamma_ have the nature of perishing away. These happen in a way similar the disappearance of snow when exposed to sunlight (_Visuddhi_-2-280; _Mahāt_. _ī_.-2- 433).

**_Nirodhe Adhimuttā_ = Inclination to _Khananirodha_**

-   . . .

_sankhāra_ and _adit_.._t_ _ha san_.._k_ _hāra_, the two objects of the _vipassanā ñān_. _a_, by virtue. . of incessantly perishing moments, are similar — classified and emphasized only in the

momentary cessation referred to as cessation momentarily of the perishing of these

_sankhāra dhamma_. Taking to heart these phenomena of inclination only to that _khananirodha_, and of the respect to _khananirodha_ are _nirodha adimut_.._t_ _atā_ = cessation is taken to heart. Thus concentrated by _paccakkha_ = following _sankhāra_ object by

concentration with _paccakkha ñā_._n_ _a dit_._t_. _ha_ and _adit_.._t_ _ha_ objects are considered to be similar by way of _khanabhanga_ means concentrtation on the perishing called _vayakhanānupassa_-

_n_. _ā_ = _bhanganupassanā_ (_Visuddhi_-2-280; _Mahāt_. *ī.-*2: 443).

**Objects of Concentration by _Bhangānupassanā Ñāna_**

_Dhamma_ on how to concentrate on these _vipassanā_ by _bhangānupassanā_ via _paccakkha_ have been expatiated in _Pa_._t_ _isambhidāmagga_ in this way.

_Katham ārammanam patisankhā bhangānupassane paññā vipassane ñānam — rūpārammanata cittam uppajjitvā bijjati, tam arammanam patisankhātassa cittassa bañgam anupassati_. R.

_Vedanārammanatā._ R*. Sankhāramma*. _Viññānārammanatā. Cakkhu_. R. _Jarā- maranārammanatā citamm uppajjitvā abhijjati_, _tam ārammanam patisankhā tassa citassa bhañgam anupassati_ (*Patisam.-*55).

-   _Rūpā_, _vedanā_, _saññā_, _sankhāra, viñañ_ etc. of _sankhāra_ object are to be concen-

trated with the notion of their nature of their _khaya-vaya_ (to be liable to extinction and perishing) = cultivated by _vipassanā_ way. The knowledge that recognizes the nature of the incessant perishing away of the _vipassanā_ on which concentration is being made do exist. Such a knowledge is the _vipassanā_ _ñāna_ (insight knowledge) = should be recog- nized as _bhangānupassanā ñāna_. How does that knowledge then come into existence?

_Vipassanā citta_ (the insight mid), the only object of which is on _rūpa_ (material) _dhamma_, can arise and perish. That material object is visualized by the nature of _khaya_- _vaya_, and the knolwdge of the nature of the _khaya-vaya_ which is the cause of perishing of _vipassanā citta_ is repeatedly concentratd by the _vipassanā citta_ in the wake of the previous one. R. (_Patisam_.-55).

**_Ñāta dhamma_ and _Ñāna Dhamma Dhamma_ of Realization and of Knowledge**

In this field of _bhangānupassanā_, the objects of meditation by _vipassanā ñāna_ (insight knowledge), because they are the _dhamma_ known penetratively by _vipassanā_ ñāna, are the _Ñāta dhamma_. These _ñāta dhamma_ including the five _khandhās_ (corporealities), 12 classes of _āyatana_, 18 of _dhātu_ (elements) and the 12 classes of _paticca samuppāda_ from _avijjā_ (ignorance) to _jarā_ (decay) and _marana_ (death). The _vipassanā_ knowledge that concentrates on the nature of perishing of these _sankhara_ _dhamma_ is the _Ñāna dhamma_.

Meditation has to be made alternately on the three properties of the existing things, taking the nature of the perishing away of these _ñāta dhamma_ as object of concentration. This knowledge of _vipassanā_ concentration = _vipassanā_ meditating _citta_ and its nature of perishing away is taken as the object for _vipassanā citta_ that follows and concentrated on the three properties of the existing things alternately. Therefore, the commentators of the early days had instructed as

_Ñātañca ñānañca ubhopi vipassati_ (_Visuddhi_-2-278; _Pa_._t_ _isam_. *.-tha.-*1-239).

Meditate on both _ñāta_ and _ñāna dhamma_. These _ñāta_ and _ñāna_ are the objects of concentration of the _bhangānupassanā ñāna_. The _dit_.._t_ _ha sankhāra dhamma_ are to be discerned by the _paccakkha ñāna_ called _bhangānupassanā ñāna_. Remember that these

_di_._t_._t_ _ha sankhāra dhamma_ include the 12 classes of _paticca samuppāda_ from _avijjā_ to _jarā_ _marana_.

At this point, according to _jāti_, _jarā_ and _marana —_ _Jātijarāmaranavuntānam khandhānam vasena pariyāyena vuttāni_ (*Patisam.-tha.-*1-222). _Jarāmaranasīsena cittha jarāmaranavuntava dhammā gahitā_ (_Sam._- _tī._-2-78). This refers to material bodies that possess the distinct nature of _jāti, jarā, maranā dhamma_.

**\*Cittan**ti cittha sasampayttacitam adhippetam* (*Patisam.*-*tha.\*-1-239).

Here instruction is given to discern on the perishing of previous _vipassanā citta_ by the later _vipassanā citta_. In instructing so, _vipassanā citta_ together with contemporary _sasampayttacetacika dhamma_ on the basis of _citta_ (mind) is required. The _vipassanā_ _citta_ together with contemporary _sasampayuttacetacika dhamma_ based on mind means series of _mahākuso_ (meritorious), _manodvārika_ (mind door) and process of _viapssanā_

 _jhāna_ occurring in the mind of practising noble ones (_ariyas_) and noble humans.

Therefore, if practisng individual (the meditator) would like to exercise on these characters of _paticca samuppāda_ by knowledge of _hangānupassanā ñāna_, both _ñāta_ and _ñāna_ factors must be concentrated on.

The features of _paticca samuppāda_ from _avijjā_ through _jarā_ to _marana_, classified by the three periods, are groups of _ñāta dhamma_. The _vipassanā ñāna_, the insight knowledge, (= _bhavangānupassanā ñāna_), by which the destruction these _ñāta dhamma_, taken as object of concentration,* are (= the process of the *jhanic* state *vipassanā* via mind door for the worldling and practising individuals) *ñāna dhamma*. The *vipassanā ñāna*, insight knowledge (= *bhavangānupassanā ñāna*), by which the nature of destruction of these *ñāta dhamma* are taken as the object in the concentration, are (= the process of the *jhanic* state *vipassanā* via mind door for the worldlings and practising individuals) *ñāna dhamma*. Only when these *ditthasanklhāra dhamma* have successfully been discerned penetratively by *bhangānupassanā ñāna*, referred to as *paccekkha ñāna*, then by means of *anvaya ñāna* that always follows *bhangānupassanā ñāna*, the past and future *sankhāra\* _dhamma_, which are not presently seen, are concentrated by the same method. This

 _anvaya ñāna_ is that knowledge which always follows the insight knowledge.

The object of contemplation _iti rūpassa atthañgamo_ etc., as exposed in the **_Upanissasuttan_,** indicated above, will again be presented in continuation.

In concord with these _desanās_, meditation in brief are. as follows. .

1. Because of cessation of _avijjā_ the _rūpa_ ceases, (_Anuppādhanirodha_)
1. Because of cessation of _tahnā_ the _rūpa_ ceases, (_Anuppādhanirodha_)
1. Because of cessation of _kamma_ the _rūpa_ ceases, (_Anuppādhanirodha_)
1. Because of cessation of _āhāra_ the _rūpa_ ceases, (_Anuppādhanirodha_)

\2. The nature of cessation of _rūpa_ the _rūpa_ ceases, (_Uppādhanirodha_).

**_ANUPPÃDANIRODHA_**

**\*Avijjānirodho rūpanirodho**ti anāgatabhavassa paccayabhūtāya imassamim bhave avijjāya arahattamaggañānena nirodhe kate paccayābhāvā anāgatassa rūpassa\*

_anuppādo nirodho hotīti attho. **Paccayanirodhatthenā**ti paccayassa niruddhabhāvenāti attho. Norodho cittha anāgatapatissandhipaccayānam idha avijjātahnākammānamyeva_

_nirodho_ (_Ptisam.-Tha._-1: 236).

**\*Avijjānirodho rūpanirodho**ti eggamaggañānena avijjāya anuppādanirodhato anāgatassa rūpassa anuppādanirodho hoti paccayābhāve abhāvato. **Paccayanirodhatthenā**ti avijjāsankhātassa anāgate uppajjanakarūpapaccayassa niruddhabhāvena. **Tahnānirodho kammanirodho**ti itthāpi eseva nayo* (*Mahātī\*-2: 421).

Throughout the rounds of rebirth the _rūpa_ and _nāma dhammas_ come to their end after going through arising-static-perishing away trend. This cessation, if the causes still remain, has a chance to make a reappearance in future. Perishing and cessation at the

 end (_bhañga_) of these _sankhāra dhammas_ are called _uppādhanirodha_ (cessation, but reappearable).

When _arahatthamagga_ (the 4th Path) is achieved, _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _sankhāra_ and _kamma_, which are completely eradicated due to, and by _arahatthamagga_ via virtue of _samucchedapa_. They cease in such a way they never reappear. This is the _anuppāda_- _nirodha_ (cessation, but reappearable). If the _arahatthamagga ñāna_ (the knowledge of the 4th Path), however, has not been acquired and these _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādana_, _sankhāra_ and _kamma_ have not ceased, these very _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādana_, _sankhāra_ and _kamma_ are

 the causative factors for the next life called the future rebirth.

But if a noble meditator tried to arrive at _arahattamagga_ then, due to _arahatta_- _magga_, the _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādana_, _sankhāra_ and _kamma_ cease in a way that they will never be formed once again. This is the _uppādanirodha_. In this way when _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādana_, _sankhāra_ and _kamma_ by nature of _auppādanirodha_, the future rebirth, called _rūpa_ and _nāma_ (mind and matter) ceases by non-reappearable cessation. This is the _anuppādanirodha_.

Similarly, _citta_ (mind), _utu_ (physical change), _āhāra_ (nutrition) etc., named _pavat_- _tipaccaya_ (cause-derived forms) cease once and for all, and never formed again in future. When they cease by nature of _anuppādanirodha,_ future material phenomena of mind, of physical change and the material quality born of nutrition (each of which has a chance to reappear if respective causes still prevail) of future also cease. This is _anuppādanirodha_.

The _yogāvacara_ individual should discern, by _udayabbayanupassanā ñāna_, called _paccakkha ñāna_, the cessation of mind and material of the future rebirth etc. of the Resultant Five Corporeality by way of _anuppādanirodha_ nature. This cessation occurs due to cessation of the factors of the 4th Path of _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādana_, _sankhāra_ and _kamma_. Continuous perishing of the Five Aggregates by _bhañkhana_ called _uppādana_- _nirodha_, and it should be discerned in the same way.

If the _yogāvacara_ individual attempting to acquire, by _udayabbayānupassanāñānāna_ called _paccakkha ñāna_, is still at _puthujana_ (worldling) stage, then the attainment of the _arahatthamagga_ (the 4th Path) may occur in the life future to the present one, or it may

be in the future life just as _Ghatibhyamā_ did. If the attainment certainly of the 4th Path is at the _Pacchimabhavika_ (later past) of the present life, then that period of the acquirement of the 4th Path will be the future of the present existence. If the attainment of the 4th

Path certainly is in one of the later lives, the the period of the acquirement of 4th Path is a future life.

At the time of acquirement of the _arahattamagga_ in future, when such causes as _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādana_, _sankhāta_ and _kamma_ cease, because of the 4th Path, by nature of _anuppādanirodha_, discernment should made of the cessation of mind and matter of the Five Corporeality of the future, following death, by nature of _anuppādanirodha_. Should

 it be contemplated by _paccakkha ñāna_ or _anvaya ñāna_? Answer to this is as follows.

_Ñānasamañgi puggato cakkhunā viya c_._a_ _kkhunā rūpāni, ñā_._n_ _ena viva_._t_ _te dhamme passati_ (_Sam_.-_Th_._a_ .-2: 49).

_dassanti vibhāveton_ “**_passato_”\***ti attanti evum vā ittha attho* (*Sam*.-*Tī\*.-2: 63).

As a man with physical eye sees a variety of mental objects by consciousness by way of sight, a meditator possessed of _vipassana_ insight referred to as _udayabbaya ñāna_, must discern by light of wisdom emitted by the _vipassanā ñāna_ being exercised upon, the following.

_Na jhānam_. _anussavākāraparivitakkamattavasena idhippetam_. (_Sam_. .-*Tī.-*2-63).

.

_Anussaya_ understanding, knowledge handed down from the teachers, such as “This may be it. This is what probably is.”, thinking on the basis of environmental

 factors = _ākāraparivitakka_ = knowledge acquired by mere thinking are not relevent here. However, _pat_._t_._h_ _amahñi paccuppanadhammānam_. _udayabbayam_. _disvā a_._t_._t_ _a atīnāgtāte nayam_. _neti_ (_Mahā_._t_ _ī_.-2-423), as stated in _Mahā_._t_ _īkā_, the _upādānakkhandhā_ (the factor of

five-fold clinging to the existence) which are the _paccuppannadhammas_ (the present _dhammas_), the nature of their formation (_sankhāra_) and their dissolution (_atthangama_) are to be discerned by the _udayabbaya ñāna_ referred to as _paccakkha ñāna_ (practical knowledge). Once discerned successfully by _paccakkha ñāna_, the _sankhāra dhammas_ (the factors of the formation) of the past and future can be discerned in the same way. It should, however, be noted that

1. The five _upādānakkhandhā_, which are the _dhammas_ of the present,
1. The nature of their _samudaya_,
1. The nature of their dissolution,

when discerned by _udayabbaya ñāna_ called _paccakkhan ñāna_, are not free from the past and future.

Though these two structurally different terms bear the same essence, the term **_jhānato_** indicates the individual, on the basis of character of his ability to know penetratively the true nature of the objection question. Indeed, _Samādithi ñāna_ (the knowledge of right understanding) possesses the character of knowing penetratively the true nature of the object.

The term _passato_ refers to an individual who is capable of seeing the true nature of the object by means of power of knowledge. Indeed. _Sammāditthi ñāna_ ( the knowledge of right understanding) is endowed with the power of seeing the object in its true nature. As an individual could see the material being (_rūpa_) by physical eye, so a meditator with competent _sammāditthi ñāna_ could see the true nature of the Four Noble Truth by the light of wisdom having property of brilliance (_Itivuttaka-Tha_.-311).

In the _santāna_ (life continuum) _vipassanā_ exercising monk, who is a worldling, before arriving at _Ariyamagga_ (Noble Path), attaining the knowledge of the Noble truth of Suffering and the Noble Truth of Formation is a priority. In these two are

1. _Uggahap_. _ativedha_ = penetratively understanding by learning the relation

between the truth of suffering and of formation.

2. _Paripucchāpa_._t_ _ivedha_ = penetratively understanding by repetitive requisition of

the meaning regarding the relationship between the truth of suffering and of formation.

 The knowledge of truth (_sacca ñān_. _a_), which penetratively knows the Four Noble Truth, is of two kinds: _lokīsacca ñān_. _a_ (knowledge of truth of mundane) and _lokuttarāsacca ñān_._a_ (the knowledge of truth of supra-mundane). Again the _lokīsacca- ñāna_ can be of _anubodha ñān_. _a_ (knowledge acquired from the predecessors) and _paccavekkhana ñān_._a_ (reviewing knowledge). In the mind of a worldling who has just gained momentum in the practice of meditation (a beginner in meditation in short), the truth of the supra-mundane, such as _asankhatadhātu_ (non-dynamic element), the knowledge of peacefulness, called _nibbāna dhamma_) which is the Truth of Cessation, and _Ariya Magga_ (Noble Path) which can concentrate on the Noble Truth of Cessation, and the Noble Eight Path. These appear in the meditator by three means, viz., by following the conception acquired by

1. _Anussava_ = knowledge acquired from the teachers.
1. _Ãkāraparivitakka_ = knowledge acquired by presumption that: if there is such a

_dhamma_ as death, then there must be one where there is no death.”

3. _Dothinijjhānakkhantianugata_ = by concentration, by being satisfied = satisfaction

on the conception by thinking.

Such a knowledge acquired via the above three means is also called _**anubodha**- **ñān**_**. _a_**, the _anubodha_ knowledge (It is the **_Anumāma_**, the knowledge acquired through the guesswork. This **_anubodha_** knowledge appears in one by concentrating on _dukkha_- _saccā_ and _samudayasaccā_ (the Truth of suffering and of formation) as the object of concentration. (It is the knowledge from personal experience, the _paccakkhañāna_). .T he _paccavekkhañāna_ (.r eviewing knowledge) appears in the Noble Ones, who have penetratively concentrated and cultured the Four Noble Truth by power of concentration on each and every one of the Four Noble Truth. _Pativedhañān_. _a_ (penetrative knowledge), the _lokottarasaccāñān_. _a_ and element of peacefulness, or the _Nibbā_._n_ _a dham- ma_ called the _dhamma_ of Truth of Cessation is concent.r ated as the object and penetra- tively knows the Noble Truth (_Visuddhi_-1: 142; _Patisam_.-_Tha_.-1: 342).

In the life continuum (_santāna_) of a monk, a worldling, who has just gaine momentum in the practice of meditation, before arriving at _Ariya Magga_, which is the Noble Truth of Suffering and Noble Truth of Cause, knowledge has to be attained by
