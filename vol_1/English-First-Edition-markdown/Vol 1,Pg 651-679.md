2. ***Kammasamuṭṭhāna* *Pāli-Quotation* (Vs-2-249)** 

Both four mental aggregates consisting in every resultant mind moment of cognitive processes, including ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness, life-continuum and death consciousness and corporealities produced by ***kamma***, such as eye-decad, vital nonad etc, totally (70) kinds, are called the ***dhammas*** produced by ***kamma***. 

3. ***Kamma paccaya*** 

***Pāli-Quotation* (*Vs*-2-249) (*Mahāṭī*-2-400)** 

Above mentioned resultant four mental aggregates and (70) kinds of corporealities produced by ***kamma*** are also known as ***kamma paccaya***, (= ***dhamma*** which is supported by ***kamma***).  It  is  right.  The ***kamma***  is  not  only  the primary  cause  of  resultant  four  mental aggregates  and  corporealities  produced  by  ***kamma***  but  also  the  secondary  cause, ***upatthambhaka*** (= supporting cause) of those ***dhammas***. It means that the ***kamma*** is a factor of great dependence condition (***upanissaya paccaya***) of those ***dhammas***. (***Mahāṭī*-2-400**). 

The ***kamma*** is also a protective cause (***paripālaka***) of those mental and corporeal ***dhammas***.  Why  is  it?  The  life-faculty  of  corporeality  (***rūpa  jhīvitindriya***)  protects corporealities  produced  by  ***kamma***  of  same  corporeal  unit  until  perishing  phase  as  a maintaining  factor.  The  resultant  life-faculty  of  mentality  also  protects  resultant  mental concomitants similarly. The heat consisting in vital nonad, which is produced by ***kamma***, also protects corporealities produced by ***kamma***, by digestibility of it’s heat, called ***udaraggi***. Both the life-faculty and the heat produced by ***kamma*** (***kammajaggi***), always protects for some persons of superior noble ones who are able to attain four requisites very easily. Thus the ***kamma*** supports to attain easily four requisites as a supporting factor. Therefore, the commentator  explained  that  “the ***kamma***  is  not  only  the primary  cause  of  resultant  four mental  aggregates  and  corporealities produced  by ***kamma***, but  also  the  secondary  cause, ***upatthambhaka*** (= supporting cause) of those ***dhammas***. It should be known the fact that the supporting  factor  of  that  ***kamma***  is  naturally  able  to  benefit  as  efficiency  of  relation  of determinative dependence (***upanissaya satti***) for the ***dhamma*** produced by ***kamma***, indeed. **(*Mahāṭī*-2-400)** 

**PAGE-652** 

Great  attributes  and  knowledge  of  ***bodhisatta***,  ***paccekabodhisatta***  and  ***sāvaka- bodhisatta*** are due to potentialities of their previous great perfections (***pāramita***) along with their uncountable lives through million millions worlds times and then their ***kamma*** are not only benefittable for their ***dhammas*** produced by ***kamma*** primarily, but also benefittable by secondary  cause  as  supporting  factors  (***upatthambhaka  paccaya***).  Indeed,  great  worldly gains,  high  attributes  and  great  wise  are  apparent  resultant  ***dhammas***  caused  by  the supporting factor of previous ***kamma***. 

4. ***Kammapaccaya cittasamuṭṭhāna*** 
* ***Kamma paccaya samuṭṭhānam nāma vipāka cittasamuṭṭhānam rūpam*. (*Vs*-2-249)** 

In  those  beings  with  five  aggregates  (***pañcavokāra***),  every  mind  moment  called ***manodhātu*** or ***manoviññāṇadhātu***, has ability to produce corporeality called ***cittaja rūpa***. Those minds which are able to produce corporeality, include ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness and life-continuum  called  ***vīthimutta  citta***,  and  receiving  consciousness  (***sampaṭicchana***), investigating consciousness (***santīra a***), registering consciousness (***tad-ārammaṇa***), which are resultant mental ***dhammas*** (***vipāka ñāma***). The arising phase of those resultant mental ***dhammas*** are also able to produce corporeality. The corporealities produced by resultant mind moments are called ***kammapaccaya citta-samuṭṭhāra***. (***Vs*-2-249**). 

***Pāli Quotation*. (*Mahāṭī*-2-400)** 

It should be known the fact the resultant mental concomitants, associating with the resultant  consciousness  in  the  same  mind  moment  are  also  caused  by  the  resultant consciousness  which  is  supported  by  ***kamma***.  (Sub-commentator  Sayadaw  said  this explanation because consciousness and mental concomitants are mutually benefited to each other  by  means  of  compatibility  (***sahajāta***),  mutually  (***aññamañña***)  and  dependence (***nissaya***).]  In  other  words,  due  to  mental  concomitants  belongs  to  ***kamma  samuṭṭhāna dhamma***, ***kamma paccaya dhamma*** and it is well understood, whereby it should not say again that the resultant mental concomitants are also included in the latter. (***Mahāṭī*-2-400**)

**4.47.5. *Kamma paccaya āhāra samuṭṭhāna* *Pāli Quotation* (*Vs*-2-249-250) (*Mahāṭī*-2-401)** 

Every  corporeal  unit  produced  by  ***kamma***,  such  as  eye-decad,  etc..,  consists  of nutriment called ***kammaja ojā***. The corporeal ***dhamma*** usually become strong at the static phase. Thus that ***kammaja ojā***, when it reaches to static phase, produces new corporeal units called ***ojaṭṭhamaka kalāpa*** which consists of eighth factor, nutriment (***ojā***). 

The ingested foods, which may be one of any kinds, before ingested or newly ingested food inside the stomach as a part of body (***koṭṭhāsa***), or undigested food in colon and rectum as  faeces,  are  a  group  of  corporeal  units  called  ***utuja  ojaṭṭhamaka  kalāpa***  produced  by temperature. If four great elements on those foods, or ingested foods, or undigested foods, are discerned, it can be found only four great elements as a clear block. If the space element (***ākāsa  dhātu***)  between  that  clear  block  can  be  discerned,  it  will  be  found  a  group  of corporeal  units.  Those  corporeal  units  are  new  generation  of  corporeal  units  which  are produced by the fire-element consisting in previous corporeal units successively. 

Thus the state of edible foods before ingestion or after ingestion or undigested one, faeces, are corporealities produced by temperature, indeed. The foods, before ingestion, are called ***Kabalīkāra āhāra***. 

Every  corporeal  unit  called  ***kabalīkāra  āhāra***  consists  of  nutriment  (***ojā***).  That nutriment, inside mouth, pharynx, stomach, intestine, rectum, before spreading throughout body, is called ***utuja ojā***, it is produced by temperature. When it gets supporting factor of temperature consisting inside the vital nonads which are situating around stomach, it become new corporeal units with eighth factor, nutriments, called ***ojaṭṭhamaka kalāpa***. The nutriment consisting in those corporeal units are new generation of ***utujhaojā***, and are called ***āhāraja ojā***.  

**PAGE-654** 

Notes : It is generally said the fact that “when it gets supporting factor of temperature, consisting  inside  the  vital  nonad  which  are  situating  around  stomach,  it  becomes  new corporeal units with eighth factor, nutriment, called ***ojaṭṭhamaka kalāpa***. Indeed, the ingested food can be spread out not only inside the stomach but also inside the mouth, pharynx, intestine etc., where into vital nonads are present and if the temperature consisting in vital nonads are able to support those nutriments, new generation of ***āhārajaojaṭṭhamaka kalāpa*** can be produced and spread out the whole body from those parts. 

***Āhāraja ojā*** = It should be recognized the fact that the nutriments consisting in the new generation of corporeal units which become from original ***utujaojaṭṭhamaka kalāpa***, depending upon the supporting factor of temperature within vital nonad, are called ***āhāraja ojā*** (nutriment produced by nutriment). 

**Union of *Kammajaojā* and *āhāraja ojā*** 

The nutriments, consisting in those corporeal units produced by ***kamma***, such as, eye- decad, ear-decad etc…, are called ***kammajaojā***. If ***kammajaojā*** is supported by spreading  ***āhārajaojā*** inside the eye, new generation of corporeal units, called ***ojaṭṭhamaka kalāpa*** with eighth factor nutriment, can be produced. When new corporeal unit reaches to static phase, the nutriment within that unit can produce new generation of corporeal units successively. In this way, (4) to (5) generations of new corporeal units can be produced by means of the same continuity  of  corporeality  (***sadisa  santati***).  It  means  the  fact  that  if  it  is  supported  by ***āhārajaojā***, the nutriment inside the corporeal unit produced by ***kamma***, can produce (4) to (5) generations of new corporeal units successively. 

**Short Notes** 

The nutriment consisting in each corporeal unit produced by temperature, if it has got supporting factor of temperature of vital nonad, is able to produce new corporeal units called ***ojaṭṭhamaka  kalāpa***.  Those  corporeal  units  are  caused  by  nutriment  and  called  ***āhāraja ojaṭṭhamaka kalāpa***. If the nutriments within corporeal units produced by ***kamma*** have got supporting factor of ***āhārajaojā*** in turn, the former are able to produce (4) to (5) generations of new corporeal units successively. Therefore the commentator explained the fact that when it reaches to static phase, ***kammaja ojā*** produces new corporeal units called ***ojaṭṭhamaka kalāpa*** which consists of eighth factor, nutriment (***ojā***). Ancient noble teachers explained that if an extrinsic factor like ***deva’s*** nutriment is available, different processes of continuity of corporealities will be continued as a result.

**4.47.6 *Kammapaccaya utusamuṭṭhāna***   

**The corporeality produced by temperature which is supported by *kamma*** 

***Pāli-Quotation* (Vs-2-250)** 

Every corporeal unit produced by ***kamma*** consists of fire-element called temperature (***utu***). When that fire-element (***utu***) reaches to static phase, it produces new ***ojaṭṭhamaka kalāpa*** with eighth factor, nutriment. That corporeal unit is produced by temperature (***utu***) and called ***utujasamuṭṭhāna rūpa*** (corporeality produced by temperature). Then that first generation of octad produced by temperature also consists of the fire-element (= temperature or ***utu***), when it reaches to static phase, it produces the second generation of pure octad called ***ojaṭṭhamaka kalāpa*** again. Thus, (4) to (5) generations of new corporeal units arise in the same  continuity  of  corporeality.  This  kind  of  corporeality  is  caused  by  the  fire-element (temperature  = ***utu***)  which  is  supported by ***kamma***  and  it  is  known  as ***kamma paccaya utusamuṭṭhāna rūpa*** (= the corporeality produced by temperature which is supported by ***kamma***). **(*Vs*-2-250)** 

Every  gentleman  who  wants  to  attain  ***nibbāna***  must  endeavour  to  fulfil  that responsibility by which those processes are essential to be seen by insight knowledge. 

48. **The arising of *cittaja rūpa* (corporeality produced by mind)** 

It should be known (5) modes of the arising of corporeality produced by mind as 

follows. 

1. ***citta*** = mind 
1. ***citta samuṭṭhāna*** = the ***dhamma*** produced by mind 
1. ***citta paccaya*** = the ***dhamma*** supported by mind 
1. ***citta  paccaya  āhārasamuṭṭhāna***  =  the  corporeality  produced  by  nutriment  which  is supported by mind 
1. ***citta  paccaya  utusamuṭṭhāna***  =  the  corporeality  produced  by  temperature  which  is supported by mind. 
1. ***Citta* = consciousness** 

One deficit of ninety (90), i.e., (89) kinds of consciousness are called consciousness (***citta***). **(*Vs*-2-250)**. 

***Pāli Quotation* (*Abhi dhammattha sangaha*)** 

- Among  (89)  kinds  of  consciousness,  except  (14)  kinds,  i.e.,  (4)  resultant 

consciousness of formless world and (10) ***dvipañca-viññā a***, the remaining (75) kinds of consciousness, are able to produce corporeality called ***cittaja rūpa***, at the arising phase of the first consciousness of life-continuum (***bhavanga***), just after ***patisandhi*** consciousness. Only one consciousness is able to produce many corporealities as one kind of ***kamma*** which is able to produce various kinds of corporeal units. 

**PAGE-656** 

1. ***Cittajarūpa, iriyāpatha, viññatti rūpa*** 

These (32) kinds of consciousness, i.e 

1. great wholesome consciousness    …  8 
1. unwholesome consciousness  … 12  
1. genesis of mirth of ***arahant*** (***hasituppāda citta***) and great mere functioning consciousness (***mahākriyācitta***)   …   9 
1. determining = mind-door-adverting  …   1 
1. wholesome ***abhiññāṇa*** and mere functioning ***abhiññāṇa*** (***kriyāabhiññāṇa***)  …   2 

total      32 

are able to produce, both 

1. ordinary ***cittaja rūpa***, 
1. deportments (***iriyāpatha***), i.e, walking, standing, sitting, reclining and  
1. special expression corporeality (***viññatti-rūpa***). 
2. **Deportments (*iriyāpatha*) *Pāli Quotation* (*Mahāṭī*-2-401)** 

Due to the  cause of occurrence of bodily expression (***kāyaviññati***), four  kinds of deportments, i.e, walking, standing, sitting, reclining, are called ***iriyāpatha***. According to the aspect  of  ultimate  reality,  it  is  the  nature  of  arising  of  corporealities  during  moment  of walking .. etc. It means that the nature of arising of corporealities by means of walking, of standing, of sitting, of reclining are called ***iriyāpatha***. **(*Mahāṭī*-2.401)** 

Is it true that there is neither ***iriyāpatha*** nor ***viññatti*** free from corporeal ***dhamma***? It is  a  question  that  why  can  either  ***iriyāpatha***  or  ***viññatti***  be  taken  out  from  corporeal ***dhammas***, separately? The answer is as follows. 

In  this  case,  there  is  actually,  neither ***iriyāpatha***  nor ***viññatti***  free  from  corporeal ***dhammas***. Although it is true, all consciousnesses which are able to produce corporeality, are able to bring forth neither supporting for long lasting stability of ***iriyāpatha*** nor special bodily expression.  Actually  a  such  consciousness  is  able  to  occur  special  bodily  expression (***viññatti***), those all kinds of consciousness are able to bring forth both supporting for long lasting stability of ***iriyāpatha*** and arising of ***cittaja rūpa*** (ordinary corporeality produced by mind). Due to inseparable condition of special bodily expression (***viññatti***), ***iriyāpatha*** and ***cittaja rūpa***, every mind which can produce special bodily expression corporeality (***viññatti rūpa***)  can  produce  ***iriyāpatha***  and  ***cittaja  rūpa***  (as  natural  fixed  law).  (It  means ***cittajaojaṭṭhamaka rūpa***, excluding ***viññatti*** and ***iriyāpatha***, are called ordinary ***cittaja rūpa.***) 

**PAGE-657** 

Similarly a such consciousness which is able to supporting for long lasting stability of ***iriyāpatha***, can produce ordinary ***cittaja rūpa***. It is because no ***iriyāpatha rūpa*** can  arise without ***cittaja ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa***. The commentator, in order to express this kind of special note, used the term “both … and” (= ***Ca***) in the phrase, “these (32) kinds of consciousness … R … are able to produce, both … R … and special expression corporeality (***viññatti rūpa***). 

3. ***Cittajarūpa* and Deportments (*iriyāpatha*)** 

The following (26) kinds of consciousness of full concentration impulsions, 

1. lofty wholesome impulsion (***mahaggata***)    …   9 
1. lofty mere functioning impulsion (***mahaggatakriya***)  …   9 
1. supra mundane consciousness (***lokuttara***)    …   8 

totally    … 26 

are able to produce both 

1. ordinary ***cittaja rūpa*** .. and  
1. deportments (***iriyāpatha***), but not able to produce special bodily expression corporeality (***viññatti rūpa***). (Among these full concentration impulsions, it should be recognized that impulsions of Super-psychic Knowledge (***abhiññāṇa***) are excluded). 

The reason why these (26) kinds of consciousness of full concentration impulsions are unable  to produce ***viññatti  rūpa***  is that \_\_\_  due  to  calmness  and  lack  of  expansion and moving of those lofty wholesome impulsions etc. It is true. \_\_\_ Impulsions of sensuous world and psychic knowledge, which have expansion and moving, are able to produce ***viññatti rūpa***. Although those consciousness of full concentration impulsions are unable to produce ***viññatti rūpa***, they are able to maintain and support for long lasting stability of deportments (***iriyāpatha***), because of the presence of effort (***ussāha***) with the help of absorption (***jhāna***). Due to presence of apparent effort, those (26) kinds of consciousness have the function of impulsions by which lofty impulsions are able to feel taste of object of either ***samatha***, such as ***paṭibhāga nimitta*** of ***kasi a*** etc., or bliss of tranquility of ***nibbāna*** continuously. 

**PAGE-658** 

***Pāli Quotation* (*Mūlaṭī*-1-151)** 

Due to unable to produce ***viññatti rūpa***, those (26) kinds of consciousness of lofty wholesome impulsions, etc., are unable to produce new deportment (***iriyāpatha***) for which ***viññatti  rūpa***  is  essential.  However,  deportments  which  are  produced  by  determining (***vuṭṭhāpana***), impulsion of sensuous world and super-psychic Knowledge, can be supported for long lasting stability in it’s position by those kinds of consciousness. The meaning of “supported”  (***upatthambhinti***)  means  “it  is  able  to  maintain  original  deportment  to  be continued, walking, standing, sitting or reclining”. 

4. **Ordinary *cittajarūpa*** 

The following (19) kinds of consciousness,  

1.(a) Rootless neutral investigating (***ahetuka upekkhā santīraṇa***)     …  2 

(b) Great consequence consciousness called consciousness of life-continuum of … 

`      `sensuous world (It refers performing function of life-continuum)     …  8 

2. Fine-material consequence called Fine-material life-continuum consciousness    …  5 
2. five adverting and two kinds of receiving     …  3 
2. Rootless wholesome consequence joyful investigating ***ahetuka kusala vipāka*** 

`    `***somanassa santīraṇa***)    …  1 total ……   19 

are able to produce only ordinary ***cittaja rūpa*** (without ***iriyāpatha*** and ***viññatti rūpa***), but are unable to produce ***iriyāpatha***, ***viññatti***. **(*Vs*-2-402)** 

***Pāli Quotation* (*Mahāṭī*-2-402)** 

- Due to lack of diligent effort, presence of calmness and weakness, (19) kinds of 

these consciousnesses are able to produce only ordinary ***cittaja rūpa***, but not ***iriyāpatha***, ***viññatti rūpa***. **(*Mahāṭī*-2-402)** 

5. **Efficiency of consciousness** 

***Pāli Quotation* (*Mulaṭī*-1-151) (*Anuṭī*-1-164) (*Mahāṭī*-2-402) PAGE-659** 

Above  mentioned  (32)  kinds,  and  (26)  kinds  of  consciousness  are  called  vigilant consciousness (***jāgaraṇa citta***) or ***kriyāmaya citta*** (the consciousness which is able to achieve process of behavioural expression). While the consciousness of life-continuums are arising continuously, it is able to maintain the whole body without moving of any bodily parts, such as shoulder etc. **(*Mahāṭī*-2-402)** 

It is right. \_\_\_ Although the bodily parts, such as .. shoulder, seems to be contracted while the consciousness of life-continuums are arising continuously, those parts do not fall back  and  contract  while  vigilant  consciousness  and  ***kriyāmaya  citta***  are  arising.  While vigilant consciousness and ***kriyāmaya citta*** are arising, the bodily parts, such as shoulder etc., become strong, resulting in continuous positions of walking, standing, sitting or reclining. It should be recognized in this way. 

6. **Only impulsion of mind-door-cognitive process (*manodvārika javana*) *Pali Quotation* (*Abhi*-A-2-388)** 

Among above mentioned determining, impulsions of sensuous world, impulsions of Super-psychic Knowledge, which are able to produce both ordinary ***cittaja rūpa***, ***iriyapatha*** and ***viññatti rūpa***, impulsions of Super-psychic Knowledge are only impulsions of mind- door-cognitive process, indeed. The determining and impulsions of sensuous world, however, are both ***pañca dvārika*** (five-doors-cognitive processes) and mind-door-cognitive process. In this case, it should be recognized mind-door-advertence (= determining) and impulsions of sensuous  world  of  mind-door  cognitive  process  are  intended  to  be  meant.  Five-doors- cognitive processes are very weak and then determining and impulsions which are included in five-doors-cognitive processes can produce neither ***viññatti rūpa*** nor ***iriyāpatha rūpa***. 

7. **Various kinds of consciousness which are unable to produce *cittaja rūpa*** 

The following (16) kinds of consciousness, 

1. Fivefold-consciousness (***dve pañca viññāṇa***) i.e, seeing-consciousness etc.,   …  10 
1. ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness of all beings   …    1 
1. death consciousness of ***arahants***    …    1 
1. Immaterial consequence consciousness    …    4 total  ……       16 

`   `are unable to produce any kind of  

1. ordinary ***cittaja rūpa***, 
1. ***iriyāpatha*** (deportments) 
1. ***viññatti rūpa*** (special expressions). **(*Vs*-2-250)** 

**PAGE-660** 

8. **The reason of inability to produce *cittaja rūpa* through *paṭisandhi* consciousness** 

Due to the following reasons, 

1. weakness of dependence factor called heart-base (***hyadaya vatthu***), 
1. lack of stable foot-hold, 
1. lack of supporting factors, such as pre-compatibility (***purejāta***) etc., 
1. just after arriving as a guest of newly existence,  
1. ***kammaja rūpa*** have already got occupation which is the cause of existing of ***cittaja rūpa***, every ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness is unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa***. 
1. At arising phase, corporealities are weak but they become strong at the static phase. This is the natural fixed law of corporeality. Either while ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness is arising or  during  life  (***pavatti***)  it  is  the  fixed  law  of  corporeality,  that  the  arising  stage  of corporeality is weak, due to lack of supporting factors of relation of post-compatibility (***pacchājāta***) and nourishment (***āhāra***) etc. The ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness, which occurs depending on weak physical base of mind, is unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa***. **(*Abhi*-*A*-2- 22)** 
1. Due to not only weakness of physical base of mind but also lack of stable foot-hold of just newly existence, as a such man who reaches to edge of chasm, is unable to resist dependence of others, similarly the  ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness is unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa*** by means of compatibility (***sahajāta***) and dependence (***nissaya***). **(*Abhi*-*A*-2-22).** 
3. The consciousness of first life-continuum, etc, just after ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness, are also lack of stability in newly existence because previous ***kamma*** produces that resultant mind. However, ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness supports it by means of efficiency of relation of contiguity (***anantara paccaya***) and the heart-base which arises simultaneously with ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness, is strong in static phase in order to support it by means of efficiency of relation of pre-compatibility (***purejāta***). The consciousness of the first life- continuum … etc, therefore, are able to produce ***cittaja rūpa***. 

The ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness, on the other hand, arises depending upon the heart- base simultaneously. That physical base of mind called heart-base is unable to support by means of efficiency of relation of pre-compatibility. If it is able to arise previously and to support the ***paṭisandhi***-consciousness through efficiency of relation of pre-compatibility, the ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness is also able to produce ***cittaja rūpa***. 

The heart-base which arose previously for such mind moment will be able to support through  relations  of  base-pre  compatibility-  dependence  (***vatthupurejātanissaya***)  for depending consciousness of such kind. For instance while the eye-clear-sensitivity etc … is present  as  corporeal  continuity,  those  other  heart-bases  are  also  continuous  arising  and passing away but those corporealities are adjacent to each others and joined by means of corporeal  continuity.  It  is  different  from  interval  of  heart-base  of  death-consciousness  of previous life and heart-base of ***paṭisandhi***-consciousness of new life, at which the corporeal continuity is discontinuous. 

**PAGE-661** 

[An example\_\_\_\_\_ let us suppose (17th) mind moment after ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness as  an  example.  ***Kammaja  rūpa***  which  arise  simultaneously  with  the  ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness, were passed away, due to expiry  of its life-span, i.e., (17) times of mind 

moments. At the arising, static and perishing phases of (17th) mind moment, ***kammaja rūpa*** are  produced  and  still  present  at  that  moment.  Suitable  numbers  of  ***cittaja  rūpa***  and ***utujarūpa*** are also present at that moment. Then the consciousness of first life-continuum and second life-continuum after ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness had also produced ***kammajarūpa*** and ***cittaja rūpa*** at all three-time-phases respectively. Those corporealities are still present at the 

time of (17th) mind moment after ***paṭisandhi***-consciousness, due to presence of its life span. Thus by the time 17th mind moment after the ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness, some corporealities are  perishing  away,  while  some  are  arising  and  static  phases  respectively,  resulting  in continuity  of  corporealities  successively.  It  should  be  understood  the  remaining  mind moments similarly.] 

While the consciousness is getting opportunity to depend heart-base which is able to support  by  means  of  relation  of  base-precompatible  dependence  (***vatthu  purejātanissaya satti***),  only  when  factors  of  absorption,  such  as  initial  application  (***vitakka***),  sustained application (***vicāra***) etc.., factors of eight-fold paths, such as right view (***sammādiṭṭhi***), right thought (***sammāsankappa***) etc… and mental concomitants, such as contact (*phassa*), volition (***cetanā***) etc… are not deficit but are completely available, that consciousness can produce ***cittaja  rūpa***  at  that  moment.  Due  to  deficiency  of  those  factors,  the  five  consciousness (***pañcaviññāṇa***),  such  as.,  seeing-consciousness  etc..  are  unable  to  produce  ***cittaja  rūpa***. **(*Abhi*-*A*-2-22)** **(*Mūlaṭī*-2-18)** 

It is one reasonable complaint. The heart-base, which arises simultaneously with the arising phase of ***paṭisandhi***-consciousness, is previously compared with the static phase and perishing phase of ***paṭisandhi***-consciousness. If it is said the fact that “due to presence of 

efficiency of relation of precompatibility, the static phase and perishing phase of ***paṭisandhi***- consciousness are able to produce ***cittaja rūpa***”, the commentator explained the following facts in order to prohibit that kind of opinion. **(*Mūlaṭī*-2-18)** 

If the consciousness, either at the static phase or at the perishing phase, can produce ***cittaja  rūpa***,  the  ***paṭisandhi***-consciousness  can  also  produce  ***cittaja  rūpa***.  But  every consciousness,  is  unable  to produce ***cittaja  rūpa***  at  the both  static  and perishing phases. **(*Abhi*-*A*-2-22)** 

**PAGE-662** 

In  that  words,  it  should  not  be  said  the  fact  that  the  heart-base  which  arises simultaneously with the arising phase of ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness is available as relation of precompatibility (***purejāta***) of the static and perishing phases of the latter. If one says like this, it shows apparently it’s fault. If those sub-moments, the static and perishing phases of such consciousness are also able to produce ***cittaja rūpa***, the ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness is also able to produce ***cittaja rūpa***. But the static or perishing phase of every consciousness is unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa***. Every consciousness, due to very rapid rate of perishing, is unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa***, at the perishing phase of itself. At the static phase, due to presence of nature of bending to perish, it is leading to perish away and is unable to produce ***cittaja  rūpa***.  At  such  phase,  due  to  presence  of  availability  of  relations  of  contiguity (***anantara***), pre-compatibility, etc., the consciousness become strong and ***cittaja rūpa*** can be arisen at that arising phase of consciousness. That kind of complaint, therefore, is deficient in factors  called precompatible dependence (***purejāta nissaya***) for ***paṭisnadhi***-consciousness. Thus, it should be recognized the fact that ***paṭisandhi***-consciousness is unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa***. **(*Mūlaṭī*-2-18)** 

Mushroom  spawn  usually  arises  together  with  soil  dusts  on  it’s  top  on  the  earth surface. Similarly, at the arising phase of consciousness, through depending upon heart-base which has arisen previously, the mind arises together with (8) kinds of ***ojaṭṭhambhaka rūpa***. [It is due to presence of strong power of the consciousness, just at the arising phase at which it is supported by efficiency of relation of contiguity (***anantara***). **(*Mūlaṭī*-2-19)**] Due to lack of relation of base-precompatible-dependence of heart-base, the ***paṭisandhi***-consciousness is unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa***. (***Abhi*-*A*-2-22**) 

4. Due to lack of authority of new comer in such place, he is unable to say others with hospitality in that place. Similarly, the ***paṭisandhi***-consciousness is also a guest of newly existence with the result that it is unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa***. **(*Abhi*-*A*-2-22)**. 
4. During life (***pavatti***), the mind and mental concomitants benefit for arising of ***cittajarūpa*** through efficiency of relations of compatibility (***sahajāta***), dependence. (***Paṭṭhāna*-1-5**). The ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness also benefits for arising of (30) kinds of ***kammaja rūpa*** with those kinds of supporting factors similarly. Those (30) kinds of ***kammajarūpa*** are substitutional corporealities of ***cittajarūpa***. The ***paṭisandhi*** consciousness, therefore, is unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa***. **(*Abhi*-*A*-2-22)**. 

**PAGE-663** 

9. **Death consciousness of *arahants*  *Pāli-Quotation* (*Abhi*-*A*-2-22-23)** 

Death  consciousness  of  arahant,  due  to  cessation  and  extinguishment  of  roots  of cycles called ignorance and craving, is unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa***. It is right- In the continuum  of  mind  of  that  arahant,  roots  of  cycles  called  ignorance  and  craving  to  all existences had been extinguished, resulting in deserving to non-reappear again. There is no continuity of corporeality for new existence. (***Abhi*-*A*-2-22,23**) 

10. **Scrutinize and bear in mind on this fact *Pāli-Quotation* (*Mūlaṭī*-2-19)** 

***Mūlaṭīkā  Sayadaw***  dissatisfied  on  explanation  of  commentator,  that  “death consciousness  of  arahant,  due  to  cessation  and  extinguishment  of  roots  of  cycles  called ignorance and craving, is unable to produce ***cittajarūpa***”. The reason why he dissatisfied on commentator’s  explanation  is  that  he  (***ṭīkā  Sayadaw***)  reasoned  that  “the  commentator Sayadaw seems to be suggested if death-consciousness of arahant is able to produce ***cittaja rūpa***, that corporeality will be continuous for next existence”. Then ***ṭīkā Sayadaw*** reasoned the  fact  that  “the  corporeality  produced  by  death-consciousness,  similar  to  corporeality produced by mind which is previous before death-consciousness, never arise again in the next existence”. Thus it should be reasoned and discussed the fact that inability to produce ***cittaja rūpa*** of the death-consciousness of arahant, due to cessation and extinguishment of cycle called ignorance and craving, explained by ***Mūlaṭīkā Sayadaw***. 

However, ***Madhuṭīkā Sayadaw*** rebutted on misinterpretation of ***Mūlaṭīkā Sayadaw*** and explained on the intention of commentator Sayadaw as follows. 

“If there are roots of cycles called ignorance and craving, new ***paṭisandhi***  will be arisen after death. In order to benefit that new consciousness, (if it is able to produce ***cittaja rūpa***), the death-consciousness of arahant is also worth reaching into availability to efficiency of  relation  of  contiguity  (***anantara  satti***).  Indeed,  death-consciousness  of  arahant  has  no efficiency of relation of contiguity. Due to lack roots of  cycles, ***cittaja rūpa*** can not be produced”, explained by ***Madhuṭīkā Sayadaw***. (But ***Mūlaṭīkā Sayadaw*** assumed the fact that every death-consciousness of all beings is unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa***. It will be clear in later.) 

11. **Opinions on death-consciousness  *Pāli-Quotation* (*Mūlaṭī*-1-151-152) (*Mahāṭī*-2-402) PAGE-664** 

Above ***Pāli Text*** called ***Sankhāra Yamaka*** (***Abhi*-6-28,29**) explains about persons who will cease ***vacīsankhāra*** called ***vitakka***, ***vicāra*** only but not ***kāyasankhāra*** called in- breath and out-breath (***assāsa passāsa***). Those persons who will not cease in-breath and out- breath means persons who never bring forth in-breath and out-breath in future, who might have to continue journey of rounds rebirth (***samsāra***) or who might not have to continue journey of rounds of rebirth. Those persons who will not cease in-breath and out-breath are as follows. \_\_\_\_\_ 

1. The  ***Arahant***  who  never  into  absorption  (***jhāna***)  but  enters  into  Sensual  Fruition- Absorption of ***Arahant*** who can be said “the person with arising phase (***uppādakkhaṇa samangī***) of (4) kinds of death consciousness and (33) mental concomitants. 
1. The ***Arahant*** who never enter into absorption (***jhāna***) but enters into Sensual Fruition- Absorption of ***Arahant*** 
1) until second registering (opportunity of death consciousness after registering) 
2) until  fifth  impulsion  adjacent  to  death  (opportunity  of  death  consciousness  after impulsion) 
2) until life-continuum (opportunity of death consciousness after life-continuum) 

which is contiguous mind of final death-consciousness, from the consciousness which ceases together with last in-breath and out-breath. 

3. if  he  will  enter  into  the  Eternal  Peace  called  ***nibbāna***  (will  extinguish)  with  ***vitakka vicāra***; if he will enter into the Eternal Peace without ***vitakka vicāra***, for whom from the ***paṭisandhi***-consciousness to arising of last (death) consciousness; if he who enters or not enter into absorption till arising phase of fifth impulsions adjacent to death, those kinds of persons who have final existences in the world of form and formless world; 
3. if he will rebirth in the world of form and formless world after death of seven planes of sensuous world and enter into the Eternal Peace, the person who is still dead in sensuous world (***kāmāvacaracavanta***) during the period from cessation of consciousness together with in-breath and out-breath till death-consciousness, 
3. if he who is opportunity to become the same plane of either world of form or formless world, will enter into the Eternal Peace, those persons of world of form and formless world, except mindless beings and the highest plane of pure-abode (***akaniṭṭha***), for whom the period from birth-consciousness to death-consciousness. 

These five kinds of persons have no ability to bring forth in-breath and out-breath (***kāyasankhāra***) in future but availability to cease ***vacīsankhāra***. 

* ***assāsa passāsā cittasamuṭṭhānāva***. **(*Vs*-1-362)** 

The in-breath and out-breath are only corporealities produced by mind. 

**PAGE-665** 

According  to  above  ***Sankhāra  Yamaka  Pali***,  ***Mūlaṭīkā   Sayadaw***  explained  that “death-consciousness of all beings is unable to produce either in-breath and out-breath or other ***cittaja rūpa*** which are similar to in-breath and out-breath. It is right. \_\_\_ If inhibitting factors for arising of in-breath and out-breath, i.e., foetal stage in womb, submerging, coma, dying, entering into the fourth absorption, during existence of world of form and formless world, entering into the Cessation-Absorption (***nirodha samāpatti***), are absent for such mind which is able to produce ***cittaja rūpa***, it will be certainty of absent for inability to arise in- breath and out-breath. 

The following contradict pairs should not be occurred simultaneously, 

\1.  by the time the moment of death-consciousness. 2. those corporealities produced by mind is still arising. 

There is no ***Pali Text*** for the fact “the death consciousness is able to produce ***cittaja rūpa***”.  The  commentator  Sayadaw  emphasized  and  explained  the  death-consciousness  of ***arahant,*** which is to be intended the fact that the ***arahants*** who never reappear in future without any junction of new life and it is quite apparent in inability to produce ***cittaja rūpa*** by their final death-consciousness. This is the suggestion of ***Mulāṭīka Sayadaw*** and ***Mahāṭīkā Sayadaw***. 

12. **Complaint of *Madhuṭīkā Sayadaw*** 

***Madhuṭīkā Sayadaw*** complained that “The death-consciousness is very weak but in- breath and out-breath are very apparent. “Although the ***Buddha*** preached inability of death- consciousness to produce ***cittaja rūpa*** in ***Sankhāra Yamaka***, one should not suggest on the fact “that death-consciousness is unable to other kinds of ***cittaja rūpa***”. ***Mūlaṭīkā Sayadaw*** 

explained the fact that “there is no ***Pali Text*** for the fact “**the death-consciousness is able to produce *cittaja rūpa***”. Similarly, there is no ***Pāli Text*** for the fact “**the death-consciousness is unable to produce *cittaja rūpa***”, complained by ***Madhuṭīkā Sayadaw***. 

13. **Inability to produce *cittajarūpa* by *pañcaviññāṇa* (five fold consciousness)** 

In the consciousness of ***dve pañcaviññāṇa***, i.e, seeing-consciousness etc., only (7) mental  concomitants,  i.e,  ***phassa***,  ***vedanā***,  ***saññā***,  ***cetanā***,  ***ekaggatā***,  ***jīvita***,  ***manasikāra***, associated  with  those  consciousnesses.  There  are  no  ***dhammas***  which  are  deserving  to become factors of absorption such as ***vitakka***, ***vicāra***, ***pīti***, ***sukha***, ***ekaggatā*** etc, in those consciousnesses. There are no ***dhammas*** which are deserving to become factors of eight fold path in those consciousnesses. There are also no rooted ***dhammas***, i.e, ***lobha***, ***dosa***, ***moha***, ***alobha***, ***adosa***, ***amoha*** in those consciousnesses. Thus due to lack of association with factors of absorption, factors of Eight-fold Path, and rooted ***dhammas***, ***devepañca viññāṇa*** are very weak and unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa***. (***Abhi*-*A*-2-23**) 

***Pāli-Quotation* (*Paṭṭhāna*-1-1; 1-8; 1-8) PAGE-666** 

Thus ***the Buddha*** preached that factors of absorptions, Eight-fold Paths and rooted ***dhammas*** are able to produce both associated ***dhammas*** of absorptions, that of Eight-fold Paths, that of rooted ***dhammas*** and ***cittaja rūpa***. Among those ***dhammas***, due to ability of absorption  of ***vitakka,  vicāra***  etc.,  the  consciousness  takes  the  object profoundly but  not superficially.  The  consciousness  which  associates  with  absorption,  therefore,  becomes stronger  in  power.  Factors  of  absorptions  plays  very  important  role  in  strong  power  of consciousness  while  factors  of  Eight-fold  Paths  and  rooted ***dhammas***  support  to become strong power of consciousness. 

With the help of faith (***saddhā***), effort (***vīriya***), mindfulness (***sati***), when the mind is concentrated on the object of either ***samatha*** or ***vipassanā*** in order to fix steadfastly on those objects, a factor of Eight-fold Path, called ***Samādhi*** (concentration), arises in him. When that concentration called ***samādhi*** becomes strong a kind of ability called ***paññā*** (knowledge) which is able to know real ultimate ***dhammas*** as they really are, will be arisen in him in accordance with the Buddha’s teaching that  “***samāhito yathābhūtam jānāti passati***” (the person with concentration knows and sees really (***Ang*-3-259**). The consciousness which is fulfilled with faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, knowledge, is very powerful and able to control the way of noble Eight-fold Path in order to reach other bank of ***nibbāna***. Factors of absorption, factors of Eight-fold Path and rooted ***dhamma*** plays vital important role in improvement of the powerful mind. Any consciousness without those factors is defective mind, resulting inability to produce ***cittaja rūpa***, as a disable person is unable to carry out various works compared with normal one (***Abhi*-*A*-2-23**) 

***Pāli Quotation*. (*Abhi*-*A*-2-23) (*Mūlaṭī*-2-18)** 

14. **Inability  to  produce  *cittaja  rūpa*  by  *arūpa  vipāka*  (consequence  consciousness  of formless world**)** 

***Pāli-Quotation*. (*Abhi*-*A*-2-23)** 

Four kinds of immaterial consequence consciousness (***arūpa vipāka***) arise to carry out functions of ***paṭisandhi***, life-continuum and death of formless world only. Due to lack of corporealities which are deserving to arise by consequence consciousness of formless world, the  latter  is  unable  to  produce  ***cittaja  rūpa***.  In  other  words,  there  are  no  fundamental corporealities in formless world originally. Due to presence of corporeality in world of form, it  is  apparent  to  occur  corporeality  by  causal  ***dhammas***  which  are  able  to  produce corporeality. But in the formless world, due to lack of fundamental corporealities, four kinds of consequence consciousness are unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa***. 

**PAGE-667** 

Then the following (42) kinds of consciousness of the formless world, i.e.,  

1. sensual great wholesome consciousness    …..    8 
1. unwholesome consciousnesses, except two rooted in hate   …..  10 
1. adverting and ***mahākriyā citta*** (great mere functioning consciousness)   …..    9 
1. wholesome consciousness of formless world   …..    4 
1. mere functioning consciousness of formless world  …..    4 
1. three kinds of Supra-mundane consciousness, i.e, the second, third and fourth 

`    `Path-Knowledge  …..    3 

7. Four kinds of consciousness of Fruit-Knowledge   …..    4 Total          42 

are also unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa***, due to absence of  corporealities in the formless world. **(*Abhi*-*A*-2-23, *Mulaṭī*-2-19)** 

Those formless world is the realm of brahmas who are disgusting with corporealities. The  absorption  of  the  formless  world  which  is  brought  forth  by  practice  of  disgust  on corporeality (***rūpa virāga***) disgusts not only on the corporeal ***dhamma*** but also on ***kasiṇa rūpa*** and absorptions of world of form which takes the object of ***kasiṇa rūpa***. The Fine- material consciousness, therefore, can not arise in the immaterial sphere. 

These are decisions found in commentaries and sub-commentaries, related with the consciousness which are able or unable to produce ***cittaja rūpa***, deportment (***iriyāpatha***), bodily expression (***viññatti***). 

15. **The consciousness is able to produce corporeality at arising phase (*ṭhiti*) only *Pāli-Quotation* (*Vs*-2-250) (*Mahāṭī*-2-402)** 

Among those consciousness, such kind is able to produce ***cittaja rūpa*** where as that consciousness  is  unable  to  produce  ***cittajarūpa***  at  either  the  static  phase  (***ṭhiti***)  or  the perishing phase (***bhanga***). It is right. \_\_\_\_\_ 

Neither static phase nor perishing phase of consciousness is strong.  

Actually,  the  arising  phase  (***uppāda***)  of  consciousness  has  strong  power,  due  to presence of supporting factors, such as efficiency of relation of contiguity (***anantara***) etc… That consciousness, therefore, produce ***cittaja rūpa***, by the time arising of itself, depending on heart-base which is able to support through efficiency of relations of precompatibility and dependence (***purejāta, nissaya***). (***Vs*-2-250**) (***Mahāṭī*-2-402**). 

**PAGE-668 P. Consciousness and mental concomitants** 

***Pāli-Quotation* (*Abhi*-*A*-3-355)** 

Although it is called ***cittaja rūpa*** (corporeality produced by mind), it is not produced by only consciousness alone but by the union of consciousness and all mental concomitants. However, it is called ***citta samuṭṭhāna rūpa*** because the consciousness is the fundamental factor to produce corporeality as a preaching methodology in mundane world. The Buddha, therefore, preached in ***sahajāta paccaya***, ***Paṭṭhāna***, that …. 

“***Cittacetasikā  dhammā  cittasamuṭṭhānanam  rūpānam  sahajāta  paccayena paccayo***” 

- Those ***dhamma*** called mind and mental concomitants are able to benefit for arising 

of ***citta samuṭṭhāna rūpa*** (***cittaja rūpa***) by efficiency of relation of compatibility (***sahajāta***). (***Paṭṭhāna*-1-5**). 

**q. Efficiency of one mind moment *Pāli-Quotation* (*Paṭṭhāna*-1-2, 1-5)** 

According to ***Paṭṭhāna***, it should be recognized the fact that one mind moment is able to  produce  numerous  corporeal  units  because  the  resultant  ***cittaja  rūpa***  are  preached  as pleural form, i.e., “***tamsamuṭṭhānānañca rūpānam***”. It can be reasoned, in the aspect of conventional reality (***samuti sacca***), the fact that only one corporeal unit is unable to carry the whole body of a person from here to there but numerous corporeal units produced by one mind moment and mental concomitants are able to carry it, hypothetically. In the aspect of ultimate reality (***paramattha sacca***), the ultimate corporeality is unable to move from here to there, due to perishing away itself just after arising in such place. Detailed explanation can be found in later, way of practice of ***iriyāpatha***, ***sampajañña***. 

**PAGE-669** 

2. ***Citta samuṭṭhāna* = the *dhamma* produced by mind** 
1. Three  mental  aggregates,  i.e.,  feeling-aggregate,  perception-aggregate,  formation- aggregate; 
1. vital nonad which consists of sound as 9th factor, plus basic 8 factors, 
1. bodily expression corporeality, verbal expression corporeality, space-element, physical agility,  physical  plasticity,  physical  adaptability,  ***upacaya***  (the  occurrence  of  real corporeality from beginning of birth to maturity of controlling faculties, i.e., eye, ear … etc), and ***santati*** (continuity of corporeality, i.e., the occurrence of real corporeality from maturity of controlling faculties to death), 

thus,  three  mental  aggregates  and  (17)  kinds  of  corporealities  are  called  ***dhamma*** produced by mind **(*cittasamuṭṭhāna*) (*Vs*-2-250)** 

Among those corporeal ***dhamma***, (8) kinds of corporealities from bodily expression corporeality  to  ***santati***,  are  called  ***citta  samuṭṭhāna***  as  a  indirect  way  of  preaching methodology  by  the  Buddha.  This  is  because  those  corporealities  are  ***anipphanna  rūpa*** which are not produced directly by cause. (***Anipphanna rūpa*** are only recognition mark produced by real corporealities but not real ultimate corporealities. Thus those are called ***cittaja rūpa*** by indirect way.) 

3. ***Citta paccaya* = the *dhamma* supported by mind** 
* ***pacchājātā  cittasetasikā  dhammā  purejātassa  imassa  kāyassa  pacchājata  paccayena paccayo*. (*Paṭṭhāna*.)** 
- The  succeeding  mind  and  mental  concomitants benefit  for  arising  of preceding 

corporealities by efficiency of relation of post compatibility. (***pacchājāta paccaya***). 

According to this preaching of the Buddha in Conditional Relations (***Paṭṭhāna***), all preceding  corporealities  produced  by  ***kamma***,  mind,  temperature,  nutriment  called ***atusamuṭṭhāna rūpa*** are called the ***dhamma*** supported by mind (***citta paccaya***). 

This  kind  of  conditional  relation  occurs  between  the  resultant  ***dhamma***,  i.e.,  the corporealities which arises previously and during its static phase and the causal ***dhammas***, mind  and  mental  concomitants,  which  arise  later, before perishing  away  of  the  resultant corporealities.  Duration  of  static  phase  of  corporeality  is  longer  than  mind  and  mental concomitants and it lasts (49) three-time-phases of mind during which the mind and mental concomitants arise and benefit for maintenance of corporealities before they perish away. That kind of benefit of mind and mental concomitants is called ***pacchājāta paccaya***. The resultant ***dhamma*** consist of all kind of ***catusamuṭṭhāna rūpa*** (corporealities produced by ***kamma***, mind, temperature, nutriment). Among these corporealities, ***cittaja rūpa*** are also included.  These  ***cittaja  rūpa***  are  not  produced  by  mind  which  is  a  causal  relation  as ***pacchājāta***, but produced by previous mind and it is still reaching in static phase. Thus the causal relation called ***pacchājāta***, means the ***dhamma*** which is benefittable for (***Ekajakāya***, ***dvijakāya***, ***Tijakāya***) ***Catujakāya*** which have been arisen previously by efficiency of relation of  post-compatibility.  Those  ***dhammas***  includes  (85)  kinds  of  consciousnesses  in ***pañcāvokāra bhūmi*** and (52) kinds of mental concomitants which arise succeedingly after arising of the resultant corporeal ***dhammas***.  

**PAGE-670** 

***Ekajakāya*** means ***kammaja rūpa*** which arises simultaneously with the arising phase of  ***paṭisandhi***  consciousness;  and  these  are  supported  by  efficiency  of  relation  of  post- compatibility of mental aggregates of the first life-continuum. 

***Dvijakāya***  means  two  kinds  of  corporealities,  i.e.,  ***kammaja  rūpa***  and  ***utujarūpa*** which arise simultaneously with static phase of the ***paṭisandhi***-consciousness; and these are supported by efficiency of relation of post-compatibility of mental aggregates of the first life- continuum.  

***Tijakāya***  menas  three  kinds  of  corporealities,  i.e.,  ***kammaja  rūpa***,  ***utujarūpa***  and ***cittaja rūpa*** which is produced by the consciousness of the first-life-continuum; these are supported by efficiency of relation of post-compatibility of mental aggregates of the second life-continuum. 

***Catujakāya*** means four kinds of corporealities, i.e., ***kammajarūpa***, ***cittajarūpa***, ***utuja rūpa*** and ***āhārajarūpa*** which arise in such time of newly existence; and these all ***catujakāya*** are supported by efficiency of relation of post-compatibility of succeeding mental aggregates.  

In  the  commentary,  ***Visuddhi  magga***,  **(*Vs*-2-249)**  it  is  explained  that  ***kamma samuṭṭhāna dhamma*** is also called ***kammapaccaya dhamma***, but not explained the fact that ***cittasamuṭṭhāna dhamma*** can be called ***cittapaccaya dhamma***. It explained ***cittapaccaya dhamma*** by means of ***pacchājāta*** only. The resultant ***dhamma*** are explained by means of ***catusamuṭṭhāna  rūpa***.  It  is  a  question  that  “why  is  it  explained  in  order  to  show  what significant factor?” The answer is as follows. 

The succeeding mind and mental concomitants benefit only ***cittaja rūpa*** which are produced  by  preceding  mind  and  mental  concomitants  but  not  ***cittaja  rūpa***  which  are produced by itself. In order to show efficiency of succeeding mind and mental concomitants by  means  of  efficiency  of  relation  of  post-compatibility  (***pacchājāta  satti***)  like  this,  the commentary explained difference between ***citta samuṭṭhāna*** and ***citta paccaya dhamma***. 

If it is suggested the fact that ***citta samuṭṭhāna dhamma*** and ***citta paccaya dhamma*** are the same as in ***kamma samuṭṭhjāna dhamma*** and ***kamma paccaya dhamma***, the mind will support by means of ***pacchājāta satti*** for both. 

1. ***citta samuṭṭhāna rūpa*** (=***cittaja rūpa***) produced by that mind and 
1. ***vedanā*, *saññā***, ***sankhāra*** which arise simultaneously with that mind. 

If should be recognized ***citta paccaya dhamma*** should be explained separately by means of ***pacchājāta***, in order to differentiate ***cittasamuṭṭhāna dhamma*** and ***citta paccaya dhamma*** respectively. **(*Mahāṭī*-2-402-403)** 

**PAGE-671** 

4. ***Cittapaccaya āhārasamuṭṭhāna* = the corporeality produced by nutriment which is supported by mind** 

***Pāli Quotation* (*Vs*-2-250, 251)** 

The nutriment (***ojā***) consisting in the corporeal unit produced by mind, while it is still reaching to static phase, is capable of producing new corporeal unit with nutriment as (8)th factor so called ***ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa***. Thus two to three successive generations of corporeal units are brought forth connection continuously. This kind of ***ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa*** is called ***cittapaccaya āhārasamuṭṭhāna*** (= the corporeality produced by nutriment which is supported by mind.). 

5. ***Cittapaccaya utusamuṭṭhāna* = the corporeality produced by temperature which is supported by mind.** 

***Pāli Quotation* (*Vs*-2-251)** 

The fire-element (= temperature) consisting in the corporeal unit produced by mind, while it is still reaching to static phase, is capable of producing new corporeal unit with nutriment as 8th factor, so called ***ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa***. Thus two to three successive generations of corporeal units are brought forth connection continuously. This kind of ***ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa*** is called ***cittapaccaya utusamuṭṭhāna*** ( = the corporeality produced by temperature which is supported by mind). (***Vs*-2-251**) 

**Efficiency of temperature, nutriment and efficiency of mind *Pāli – Quotation* (*Mahāṭī*-2-403)** 

Due  to presence  of  greater  efficiency  of  temperature  and  nutriment,  consisting  in corporeal unit produced by ***kamma*** (***kamma samuṭṭhāna rūpa***), than that of temperature and nutriment,  consisting  in  corporeal  unit  produced  by  mind  (***citta  samuṭṭhāna  rūpa***),  the commentator explained that four to five successive new generations of corporeal units arise continuously; it can be compared with two to three successive new generations of corporeal units can arise in the later kind (***citta samuṭṭhāna rūpa***). Actually it is explained for ***citta samuṭṭhāna rūpa*** by means of normal consciousness of sensuous world only (***kāmā vacara citta***).  However,  many  successive  new  generations  of  corporeal  units  can  be  arisen  by ***cittasamuṭṭhāna  rūpa***  which  are  produced  by  ***mahaggata***  (lofty)  and  ***lokuttara  citta*** (consciousness  of  ***jhānic***  state  and  supra-mundane).  It  can  be  accepted  this  fact  because ***cittaja  rūpa***  produced  by  ***mahaggata  citta***  and  ***lokuttara  citta***  are  great  superior  kinds, indeed. **(*Mahāṭī*-2-403)**

In previous section, explanation on light, it is detailed explained about nature of light produced by minds of ***samatha*** practice and mind of ***vipassanā*** practice. The light produced by ***vipassanā*** practice is caused by bright colour of corporeal units produced by mind and bright  colour  of  corporeal  units  produced  by  temperature  which  is  supported  by  mind, internally. The shining light externally is caused by bright colour of corporeal units spreading out external to the body successively, which are striking each other continuously. Therefore it should be accepted these facts that both many generations of corporeal units can be brought forth by ***cittasamuṭṭhāna rūpa*** during ***vipassanā*** practice and many generations of corporeal units can be brought forth not only internally but also externally by ***utujarūpa*** which is produced by temperature (= fire-element) consisting in ***citta samuṭṭhāna kalāpa***. **(*Mahāṭī*-2- 428, 429)** 

* ***Evam cittaja rūpassa nibbatti passitabbā*, (*Vs*-2-251).** 

Thus the arising nature of ***cittaja rūpa*** must be discerned in order to see penetratively. **(*Vs*-2-251)**.  According  to  this  explanation,  every ***meditator***  who  wants  to  attain ***nibbāna*** should be recognized to discern the arising nature of ***cittaja rūpa*** by penetrative knowledge. 

49. **The nature of arising of *āhārajaūpa* (corporeality produced by nutriment)** 

It should be known (5) modes of the nature of arising of corporeality produced by nutriment as follows. 

1. ***āhāra*** = nutriment 
1. ***āhārasamuṭṭhāna*** = the corporeality produced by nutriment 
1. ***āhāra paccaya*** = the corporeality supported by nutriment 
1. ***āhārapaccaya  āhārasamuṭṭhāna***  =  the  corporeality  produced  by  nutriment  which  is supported by nutriment 
1. ***āhārapaccaya  utusamuṭṭhāna***  =  the  corporeality  produced  by  temperature  which  is supported by nutriment 
1. ***Āhāra* = nutriment** 

***Pāli Quotation* (*Visuddhi*-2-251) (*Abhi*-*A*-3-377) (*Mahāṭī*-1-455) PAGE-673** 

***Kabaļīkāra āhāra*** (= the nutriment which is not really mouthed as much as mouthful food but assumed like this) is the nutriment (***āhāra***). 

***Kablīkāra āhāra*** means (4) types of nutriments, i.e, 

1. ***kammaja ojā*** = the nutriment consisting in the corporeal unit produced by ***kamma***; 
2. ***cittaja ojā*** = the nutriment consisting in the corporeal unit produced by mind; 
2. ***utuja ojā*** = the nutriment consisting in the corporeal unit produced by temperature; 
2. ***āhāraja ojā*** = the nutriment consisting in the corporeal unit produced by nutriment. 

Although those (4)  kinds of nutriments consisting in ***catusantatisamuṭṭhāna rūpa*** (=continuity of corporealities produced by (4) origins) are called ***āhāra***, it is able to carry out it’s function after ingestion as mouthful part, but not able to carry out it’s function as put in bowl, dish, etc. 

The function of nutriment (to produce new ***āhāraja rūpa***) can be accomplished only after it is ingested and due to this reason, the Buddha preached combination with ***kabaļīkāra*** as a prefix of ***āhāra***. **(*Abhi-A-3-377*)**. 

***Pāli Quotation* (*Mūlaṭī*-3-190) (*Anuṭī*-3-258).** 

The meaning of the phrase “it is able to carry out it’s function after it is ingested as mouthful part”,  is  as  follows.  The  ingestable  nutriment  is  only  corporeality produced by temperature, while it is being put in the bowl, dish, etc … These are a group of corporeal units produced by temperature. Every corporeal unit consists of nutriment called ***utuja ojā*** which is impossible to be ingested singly because those corporealities, i.e., (8) factors in every corporeal unit, are inseparable corporealities (***avinibbhoga rūpa***). Thus the function of nutriment can be carried out after it is ingested bulk of corporealities as ingestable food and drink. 

**PAGE-674** 

It  is  right.  \_\_\_\_\_  Such  juice  which  is  deserving  to  drink,  such  powder  which  is deserving to lap, are also included in terms of mouthful part. It should be recognized the fact that “only after it is ingested mouthful part of any food or drink, can the function of nutriment be carried out generally. **(*Mūlaṭī*-3-190, *Anuṭī*-3-258)**. 

In  other  words,  ***Kabaļīkāra***  is  called  ***catusamuṭṭhānika  ojā***,  due  to  presence  of situation of the latter in food which is deserving to ingest as mouthful part. **(*Abhi*-*A*-3-377)**. 

According to explanation found in ***Abhi*-A-3-377**, the word “***ijjoharitabbavatthuka***” means ***catusamuṭṭhānika ojā*** which is consisting in every corporeal unit produced by four origins, i.e., ***kamma***, mind, temperature, nutriment; which is situated in ingestable food and drink. The term, ***catusamuṭṭhānika ojā*** can be known as ***Kabalīkāra*** because the name of dweller  can  be  called  similarly  on  that  of  situation  by  means  of  metaphor  called ***ṭhānūpacāra***. 

1. ***Ijjoharitabba vatthuka*** 

The meaning of ***ijjoharitabbavatthuka*** (= ***catusamuṭṭhānika ojā*** which is situated in ingestable food and drink) is as follows. 

***Pāli Quotation* (*Vs*-2-223)** 

According to above explanation of ***Visuddhimagga***, the ingested food of beings is only ***utuja ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa*** (= corporeality produced by temperature). It is only ***utuja rūpa*** whatever condition it might be, either in the bowl or dish, or in the stomach before digestion take place or before physiological processes of absorption and assimilation take place. It should be discerned on newly ingested food as four great elements. It can be seen a group of corporeal units for sharp wisdom ***meditator*** in this stage. The fire-element within a corporeal units, when it is reaching to static phase, is able to produce new corporeal units successively. 

Those mass of corporeal units produced by temperature, called ***kabaļīkāra āhāra***, is ingested and reached into pharynx, stomach, intestine etc. Before physiological processes of absorption and assimilation take place, it is only ***utuja rūpa***. When it is supported by the fire- element consisting in the vital nonad (***jīvitanavaka kalāpa***) situating around stomach and intestine,  it  becomes  new  corporeal  units  called  ***Ojaṭṭhamaka  Kalāpa***  (pure  octads  with nutriment as 8th factor). 

It is made up of nutriment consisting in ***Kabaļīkāra āhāra*** with the help of fire-element of vital  nonad  and  then  it  is  called  ***Āhāraja  ojaṭṭhamaka  rūpa***.  Those  corporealities  are spreading throughout body called (6) doors, i.e, eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and heart as a base of mind-door. 

When the nutriments consisting in those corporeal units called ***āhārajaojaṭṭhamaka*** supports the nutriments consisting in … 

1. every corporeal units produced by ***kamma***, 
1. every corporeal units produced by mind, 
1. every corporeal units produced by temperature, 
1. every corporeal units produced by nutrient  

which exist in preceding ***āhārajarūpakalāpa***, the supported nutriments are able to produce new generation of corporeal units called ***ojaṭṭhamaka kalāpa*** with nutriment as 8th factor. 

Thus  the  function  of  nutriment  of  ***catusamuṭṭhānika***  depends  on  nutriment  consisting  in ***kabaļīkāra āhāra***, in order to achieve it’s function. The commentator Sayadaw, therefore, explained as follows. 

***Pāli Quotation* (*Abhi*-*A*-3-377)** 

- ***Kabaļīkāra*** is called ***catusamuṭṭhānika ojā***, due to presence of situation of the latter 

in food which is deserving to ingest as mouthful part. **(*Abhi*-*A*-3-377)**. 

***Pāli Quotation* (*Vs*-2-251)** 

- The  nutriment  of  one-day  ingested  food  can  support  maintenance  of  the  body 

throughout (7) days. (***Vs*-2-25**1) 

When  the  nutriment  of  preceding  corporeal  units  produced  by  nutriment  get supporting factor of the nutriment of succeeding corporeal units produced by nutriment, the former  are  able  to  produce  new  corporeal  units  called  ***āhārajaojaṭṭhamaka***.  It  should, therefore, be recognized that “***āhārajaojā*** is not only primary cause (***janaka paccaya***) but also secondary cause (***upatthmbhaka paccaya***)of the arising of new ***āhāraja rūpa***”. However it should not be misunderstood the fact that one nutriment within one corporeal unit is both primary and secondary cause. It means that the nutriment of preceding one is the primary cause, while that of succeeding one the secondary cause, indeed. 

**PAGE-676** 

According  to  above  explanations,  because  intrinsic  factor  of  nutriment  is  able  to produce ***āhārajarūpa*** but extrinsic factor of nutriment which is situating in bowl, dish etc., is unable to produce ***āhārajarūpa***, ***Mahāṭījkā Sayadaw*** explained on ***āhāra*** as follows. 

* ***Āhāroti ijjattiko rūpuppādaka āhāro*. (*Mahāṭī*-1-455)** 
- Four kinds of nutriments consisting in corporeal units produced by four origins 

(***catusamuṭṭhānika ojā***) of internal continuum of corporeality, which are able to produce ***ahārajarūpa*** is called ***āhāra*** (nutriment). (***Mahāṭī*-1-455**). 

The Knowledge of Omniscience of the Buddha, which is able to instruct to arise very profound knowledge of disciples, is very wonderful, very delightful, and it is deserving to worship exceedingly. Similarly, both commentators and sub-commentators are also deserving to acknowledge exceedingly. 

2. **General notes** 

***Pāli Quotation* (*Abhidhammattha sangaha*)** 

Although food and drink which are deserving to ingest are called nutriment only the nutriment consisting in corporeal unit called ***utuja ojaṭṭhamaka*** must be inferred as nutriment (***āhāraja  rūpa***).  In  order  to  know  this  point  Venerable  ***Anuruddha***  explained  that ***ajāsankhāto āhāro*** (***āhāra*** called nutriment) which is similar to explanation found in ***Mūla paṇṇāsa aṭṭhakathā***. 

***Pāli Quotation* (*M*-*A*-1-211)** 

Then  the  function  of  nutriment  and  it’s  procedure  to  produce  ***āhāraja  rūpa***,  are explained in commentaries as follows. 

***Pāli Quotation* (*Vs*-2-251) (*M*-*A*-1-213)** 

Venerable  ***Anuruddha***  explained  generally  in  accordance  with  common commentaries that “***ijjoharaṇakāle samuṭṭhāpeti***” = ***Āhāra*** called nutriment, while it is still reaching to the static phase, produce ***āhāra samuṭṭhāna rūpa*** after it is ingested”. 

**PAGE-677** 

Indeed, according to explanations found in above commentaries, before it is ingested, just reaching on the tongue, nutriments with ***ojaṭṭhamaka kalpa*** of some foods spread inside the body. The better the quality of nourishment the higher rate of spreading of nutriment and ***ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa***. The low grade nourishment, however, after it is ground by teeth and ingested, is able to spread out it’s nutriment and ***ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa***. Wherever it spreads inside body, it gets supporting factor of fire-element of vital nonads which are spreading out the whole body. Thus it should be recognized that ***ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa*** called digested food spreads throughout body from the tongue at which vital nonads are present and those are able to support the function of nutriment. After it is ingested and reached into the stomach, ***utuja kalāpa*** are digested by the  help of fire-element of vital nonads and digested nutriment spread out the whole body through blood vessels called ***rasaharaṇī***. The nutriment consisting in ***ojaṭṭhamaka kalāpa*** is able to produce new ***ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa*** in everywhere it spread by the help of the fire-element of vital nonads. 

Therefore,  neither  ingestion  nor  non-ingestion  is  significant  but  spreading  out  of corporeal units called ***ojaṭṭhamaka*** is main factor. For instance, when ***Isisiñga***, a virtuous hermit, had unconscious about three years, ***āhārajarūpa*** arose continuously in him, due to insertion of nutriments made by heavenly being through the pits of bodily hairs. 

Recent days, patients who are not able to take food normally, are survival, due to insertion of nutriments through either vessel or nasal feeding and ***āhāraja ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa*** can be brought forth in them. 

A foetus in the womb is able to produce ***āhāraja ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa***, due to supporting of nourishment through umbilical cord. Some kinds of nutriments which are rubbing on the skin, are absorbed through skin and able to produce ***āhāraja ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa***. 

Nutriment of one-day ingested food can support about (7) days for man while about one  to  two  months  for  heavenly  beings,  due  to  successive  production  of  ***āhāraja  rūpa*** generation by generation. (***Vs*-2-251,** ***M-A-*1-213**) 

It is explained that “***ṭhānapattova samuṭṭhāpeti***.” (= the nutriment, only when it is reaching  to  static  phase,  produces  ***āhāraja  rūpa***),  due  to  nature  of  corporeality  which becomes strong at the moment of static phase. Although it seems to be original water in the cup,  preceding  corporeal  units  produced  by  temperature  always  perishing  away  and succeeding corporeal units of the same kind are produced and they replace previous ones successively. Similarly preceding nutriments which are spreading throughout body always perish away and succeeding nutriment are also newly formed continuously indeed. In other words, in the aspect of ultimate reality,  

**PAGE-678** 

preceding corporeal units consisting of nutriments are always perishing away and succeeding corporeal  units  consisting  of  nutriments  are  always  substituted  for  previous  ones continuously. During producing new generations of corporeal units, when newly produced corporeal unit reaches to static phase, if it is supported by the fire-element of vital nonads spreading throughout body, the nutriment consisting in that newly produced corporeal unit is able to produce successive generation of corporeal units again. (Detailed explanation can be found in **page 86-94, Volume IV**.) 

2. ***Āhāra samuṭṭhāna* = the corporeality produced by nutriment *Pāli Quotation* (*Vs*-2-251, *Mahāṭī*-2-403)** 

***Ojaṭṭhamaka  rūpa***  with  nutriment  as  8th  factor,  which  is  produced  by  nutriment consisting in corporeal unit produced by ***kamma***, when it reaches to static phase, it consists of (8)  kinds of  corporealities, i.e, earth-element, water-element, fire-element, air-element, colour, smell, taste, nutriment. Then (14) kinds of corporealities, resulting from those (8) kinds plus space-element, physical agility, physical plasticity, physical adaptibility, ***upacaya***, and continuity (***santati***) are called ***āhārasamuṭṭhāna rūpa*** (= the corporeality produced by nutriment). 

According to the phrase, “***upādinnam kammaja rūpam paccayam labittvā***” (= due to presence of supporting factor of ***kammaja rūpa*** which is ***upādinna***), it shows the fact that the nutriment consisting in inanimate world (***anupādinna ojā***) is unable to carry out the function of ***ahāraja  rūpa***.  Then  external  nourishments  are  only  a  group  of  corporeal  units  called ***utujaojaṭṭhamaka***  which  contains  only  ***anupādinna  ojā***  (the  nutriment  produced  by temperature). That kind of nutriment depends on the four great elements produced by ***kamma*** in  order  to  produce  ***āhāraja  rūpa***.  The  commentator,  therefore,  explained  that  “***tattha patiṭṭhāya***” (= through depending on the four great elements produced by ***kamma***”).
