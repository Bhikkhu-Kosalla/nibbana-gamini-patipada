_Kiccāna_ .... All the santient beings mostly are clinging to the fact that (the belief that self always remains as self) one's form is everlasting, and that (self has a limit) there is a time when self exists not any more ( a view called _sassatadittihi ucchedaditthti_).

_Kiccāna_ .... He who sees, by _vipassanā ñāna_ and _magga ñāna_, the nature of the cause of arising and of resultant formation in its true perspective of the _sankhāra loka_, there does occur such a thing as non-existance in such a person (a clinging to the belief that the self lost its existance one the living being died).

_Kiccāna_ .... In _sankhāra dhammas_ the clinging such as "mine, mine", attachment by craving = _tahnupaya_, attachment to the view of "the assume I" = _ditthupaya_, strong attachment = _upādana_ (clinging), deep rootedness = _abhinivesa_ (adherence to one's belief) factors mostly wrapped the santeint beings around.

This Noble One, my disciple, do not adhere to, clings to nor cultivate in his citta these adherence = _upaya_, the strong clinging = _upādan_, as the the assume I.

He does not have wrong belief nor wrong thought such as "**_Dukkhameva uppajjamānam uppajjati_, _dukkham nirujjhamānam nirujjhati =_ If something formed, it the suffering that is formed, if cessation occurs, then it is the dukkha which does cease".**

**\*Aparapaccayā ñāmamevassa ettha hoti** =\* This disciple does not depend upon others to have acquired such belief. He knows by him self by virtue of the **_Attapaccekkha ñāna_.** _Kiccāna_ ....\** This much will suffice to have the right view = *sammāditthi\*

(_Sam_.-1: 257-258).

**_Lokasamudaya_** — **_Lokanirodha_**

Arising and Cessation of Mundane

Formation of _sankhāra_ due to _avijjā_ and of _viññāna_ due to _sankhāra_ called the process of formation of called the mundane _sankhāra_ = _anulomapaccayākāra_ = _anuloma_- _paticca_ _samuppāda dhamma_ is called **_Lokasamudaya_**. _Nibbattilakkhanā_ called _upāda_ (arising) of the characters of the _paticca samuppāda_, such as _avijjā_, _sankhāra_ - etc. is also called the **_Lokasamudaya_**.

Absolute dissolution (by way of _asesavirāga_ and _anuppādanirodha_) of _avijjā_ is due to _arahattamagga_. Because of this dissolution, by means of the non-reappearing cessation, the resultant _sankhāra_ ceases (by way of _asesavirāga_ and _anuppādanirodha_) completely by non-reappearing cessation which is the process of dissolution of _sankhāra_

-   _patilomapaccayākāra dhamma_ = _patilomapaticca samuppāda dhamma_ is also referrd to as **_Lokanirodha_**. The dissolution of _avijjā_, _sankhāra_, etc., which are the characters of _paticca samuppāda_ and which are subject to change called _viparināma lakkhanā_, are also termed **_Lokanirodha_**.

If stated with reference to Patisambhidā Pāli, _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādana_, _sankhāra_, _kamma dhammas_ etc. for which _sanmudaya saccā dhamma_ as their cause clearly arises = clearly present. Due to this the cause _viññāna_, _nāma_-_rūpa_, _salāyatana_, _phassa_, _vedana_ etc. referred to as the resultant five clinging aggregates, the _dukkha saccā_ (the truth of suffering), has clearly formed. These are all called the **_Lokasamudaya_**.

_Avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādana_, _sankhāra_, _kamma_ etc., with _samudaya saccā_ _dhammas_ as the cause, ceased absolutely because of the _arahattamagga_ (via the _asesavirāga_, _anuppā- danirodha_), by means of a non-reappearable dissolution. Due to such a cessation the resultant _viññāna_, _nāma_-_rūpa_, _salāyatana_, _phassa_, _vedana_ etc. called the five clinging aggregates which are the truth of suffering ceased (via the _asesavirāga_, _anuppādaniro- dha_) through a process of non-reappearable cessation, are also called **_Lokanirodha_.** The dissolution of the five clinging (or dissolution of the cause and consequences) by means of _viparināma lakkhanā_ is also the **_Lokanirodha_.**

When the noble disciple, the follower of the Buddha, discerns on the formation and process of formation, of cessation and its process by _vipassanāsammāditthi ñāna_, he would know that —

**_Dukkhameva uppajjamānam uppajjati_, _dukkham nirujjhamānam nirujjhati_** = If it arises, then it is the _dukkha_ which arises; if it ceases, then it is the _dukkha_ which ceases. In him there is no doubt, no scepticism.

As explained above _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādana_ called the _kilesavatta dhamma_ (the factors of recurrent of defilements) are just the _upādānakkhandhā_ (clinging aggregates). The _sankhāra_ – _kamma_, referred to as _kamma vatta_ (recyle of action), are also just the _upādānakkhandhā_. So are the _viññāna_, _nāma_-_rūpa_, _salāyatana_, _phassa_, _vedana_ etc., which are the _vipākavatta dhammas_. These _upādānakkhandhas_ are — _sankhittena_ _pañcuppādānakkhandha dukkhā_ (_Dī_.-2:243; _Ma_.-1: 82; _Ma_.-3: 292; _Abhi_.-2” 105), in accordance with _desanās_, only the _dukkha dhammas_ which are being tortured by the phenomena of arising and perishing all the time.

It is expatiated as “if it arises, it is the _dukkha_ which arises; if it ceases, it is the _dukkha_ which ceases” and the meditator understands this arising and the process of arising, and ceasing and the process of ceasing of the _sankhāraloka_ by _sammāditthi ñāna_ and _maggasammāditthi ñāna_. In understanding the arising and its process, dissolution and its process of the _dukkha_ referred to as _lokasamudaya_ and _lokanirodha_, which kind of knowledge is involved, the _paccekkha ñāna_ or _anvaya ñāna_? See the following for the answer.

_Aparapaccayā ñānamevassa ettha hoti_ (_Sam_.-2: 32).

**\*Aparapaccayā**ti na parappacayena*, *aññassa apattiyāyetvā attapaccekkhaññānamevassa ettha hotīti* (*Sam*.-*Tha\*.-2: 32).

In accordance with the opening of the Pāli text, this is not the kind of knowledge that ends up in individuals who acquired it by words of mouth from his predecessors. The Buddha expounded that, in fact, “In this case the disciple does not depend on others, he understands it by his self via _attapaccekkha ñāna_ (practical knowledge). Therefore, this understanding is the knowledge of _attapaccekkha ñāna_.

In this Suttana, the Buddha has expatiated with reference to the combination of these _lokī_ and _lokuttara sammāditthi_ which are the _vipassanāsammāditthi_ called the _lokī_- _samāditthi_ and _lokuttarasammāditthi_ called _maggasammāditthi_.

_Nāma-rūpaparicchedato patthāya sammāditthiyā vattattā lokiyalokuttaramissakam sammāditthim avoca_ (_Sam_.-_Tī_.-2: 38).

As the Buddha has sermoned _sammāditthi ñāna_ (knowledge of right understan- ding) starting from _nāmapariccheda ñāna_ (knowledge that discerns the corporeality and mentality as two separate groups), the _sammāditthi_, the combined _lokīlokuttara_, has been said to have indicated in this suttana (_Sam_.-_Tī_.-2: 38).

This _sammāditthi_ is the _catusaccasammāditthi_ (the right understanding of 4-fold noble truth). These are the right understanding of the truth of suffering, the right understanding of the truth of origin of suffering, the right understanding of the truth of the cessartion of suffering, and the right understanding of the truth of Path. The Buddha has instructed this knowledge of right understanding as **_attapaccekkha ñāna_** in Kiccāna- gutta Suttan. The same explanation has been given in the Atthakatthā (book of meaning). That the Buddha has expounded from the _nāma_-_rūpapariccheda ñāna_ to _catusaccaditthi_ called the _attapaccekhha ñāna_ has again been indicated by the teachers.

In _Nibbānagāminipati_._p_ _dā_ also, the followings have been written in accordance with the instructions given by the Buddha’s doctrines, Atthakathā and Tīkā.

1. Concentration on corporeality called _rūpakkhandhā_ by _attapaccekkha ñāna_ to discern penetratively until _paramatta_ is attained has been described in section on Rūpakammatthāna. (Vol. I).
1. Concentration on corporeality called _rūpakkhandhā_ by _attapaccekkha ñāna_ to discern penetratively until _paramatta_ is attained has been described in section on Nāmakammatthāna. (Vol. II).
1. The process of origin of _sankhāra loka_, called the _lokasamudaya_, which is the _anulomapaccayākāra_ = _anuloma paticcasamuppāda_ _dhammas_, and concentration on these made by _attapaccekkha ñāna_ to discern penetratively until _paramatta_ is attained has been described in section on Paticcasamuppāda. (Vol. III).
1. Culturing of the _sankhāra dhammas_ by way of their _lakkhana_ (character), _rasa_ (taste), _paccuppatthāna_ (manifestation), and _padatthāna_ (proximate cause) has been described in section on Paticcasamuppāda. (Vol. IV).
1. Discerning penetratively of formation and its process, cessation and its process of these lokasamudaya and lokanirodha is has been described in section on Vipassanā. Especially in Udayabbayānupassanā ñāna section, they are given under the names **_Samudayadhammānupassī_ Section*, Vayadhammānupassī* Section** and **_Samudayavayadhammānupassī_ Section.** (Vol V).
1. _Vipassanā_ exercise on the _adittha_ past and future _sankhāra_ (which do not belong to the present) _anvaya ñāna_ has been described in section on Udayabbayānupassanā. (Vol. VI).

**What _Anvaya Ñāna_ Is**

Included in the knowledge of _catusaccasammāditthi ñāna_ is _dukkha saccā_ named the five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_ which are meditated so as to attain _paramatta_ which understands penetratively by means of _sammāditthi_, which understand the _samudaya_ _saccā_ penetratively = _sammāditthi_ which penetratively understands the formation of _dukkha saccā_ because of _samudaya saccā_. _Vipassanā ditthi_ penetratively knows the true facts of the impermanence, of the suffering and of arising to a stage of _khanikanirodha_ (momentary cessation). The dissolution of the _samudaya saccā dhammas_ by means of _anuppādanirodha_ due to which _dukkha saccā dhammas_ cease by way of _anuppāda- nirodha_ is understood penetratively by _vipassanāditthi_. The discerning _lokīmagga_ _dhamma_ referred to as _vipassanā ñāna_ (insight knowledge); the knowledge of _vipassanāditthi_ that penetratively understands the facts of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of these _lokīmagga dhammas_; the _maggasammāditthi_ which* penetratively understands *asanñkhata dhātu*, *nibbāna dhātu* referred to as *nirodha saccā* by *ārammanapativedha*; the knowledge of *maggasammāditthi* that penetratively understands *dukkha saccā*, *samudaya saccā* and *magga saccā dhammas* by means of *asamohapativedha\* etc. are all sammāditthi ñāna and are instructed by the Buddha to be **_Aparappaccaya ñān_. _a = Attapaccakkha ñān_. _a_.** The Atthakthā, Tīkā also have explained in a similar way. If so a question arises as to whether or not an **\*anvaya**ñā*.*n\* _a_ is involved in these _catusaccasammā_- _ditthi ñān_. _a_. The following will answer this question.

**_Dhammañāna_** — _Ariyamagga ñā_._n_ _a_ penetratively knows, taking the _dhamma_ of _nibbāna_, the _nirodha saccā_, as the object by way of _ārammana pa_._t_ _ivedha_ which bears a meaning as the penetrative knowledge. By annihilation of _moha_ which hinders the understanding of the truths such as _dukkha saccā_, _samudaya saccā_, and _magga saccā_, acquired the penetrative knoweldge by virtue of _asammohapa_._t_ _ivedha_. _Ariyaphala ñān_. _a_ (the Noble Fruit Knowledge) understands these, by taking the _dhamma_ of _nibbāna_, _nirodha saccā_, via a penetrative knowledge of _asammohapativedha_. Seeing and knowing this way, _ariyamagga ñān_. _a_ included in the 4-fold _ariyamagga_ and the _ariyaphala ñā_._n_ _a_, included in the 4-fold _ariyaphala_, are all called the _dhamma ñān_. _a_.

.

**_Anvaya ñāna_** — _Anvaya ñāna_ sees the Four Noble Truths penetratively and presently via _paccekkha ñāna_ (practical knowledge). In a similar way this knowledge knows “in the past as well as in future, only these five _khandhas_ (5-fold clinging aggregates) are the _dukkha saccā_, only the _tahnā_ is the _samudaya saccā_, only the _nirodha_ _nibbāna_ noble _dhamma_ is the _nirodha saccā_, and only the eight _maggañ_ are the _magga_

 _saccā_.”

 In this way _anvaya ñāna_ is the kind of knowledge that always follows the _dhamma ñā_._n_ _a_ (_T_. _ī_.-_Tha_.-3: 202).

_Anvaya ñān_. _a_ is a knowledge which is formed corresponding to _dhamma ñā_._n_ _a_. A knowledge which always follows the _dhamma ñā_._n_ _a_.. The name _anvaya ñā_._n_ _a_ is the name of **_paccavekkhana ñān_. _a_** (reflective knowledge) (_Sam_.-_T_. _ha_.-2: 62).

 Therefore, note that **_paccavekkhana ñāna_** which arises corresponding to _dhamma ñān_. _a_ referred to as the _ariyamagga ñā_._n_ _a_, _phala ñā_._n_ _a_ = a reviewing knolwedge is called the **_anvaya ñān_. _a_**. In _lokuttarācattusaccāsammāditthi ñā_._n_ _a_, note that _navaya ñā_._n_ _a_ is not included. This is all about the _anvaya ñān_. _a_, a knowledge that always follows _lokuttarā ariyamagga ñā_._n_ _a_ and _phala ñā_._n_ _a_.

**The _Anvaya Ñāna_ that always follows the _Vipassanā Ñāna_** **_Nāma-rūpaparicchedato pat_**.**_t_** **_hāya sammāditthiy_**.**_ā_** **_vuttattā lokiyalokut_**.**_t_** **_aramissaka_**.**\*m\*\*\*\***

_sammādi_._t_._t_ _hi avoca_ (_Sam_.-_Tī_.2: 38).

As explained above by the teacher, the Buddha has preached the _sammāditthi_ _ñāna_ starting from _nāmaparicche_-_da ñāna_ and because of this there also is _anvaya ñāna_ which always follows _vipassanā ñāna_ named _lokīcatusaccasammāditthi ñāna_. As the _anvaya ñāna_, which always follows the _ariyamagga ñāna_ and _phala ñāna_, is just only the reflective _paccavekkhana ñāna_, and is not included in _lokuttara catusaccasammāditthi ñāna_. Similarly _anvaya ñāna_, which always follows the _vipassanāsammāditthi ñāna_ referred to as _lokīcatusacca sammāditthi_, is just only a kind of _paccavekhhana ñāna_. It is not included in _lokī catusaccasammāditthi ñāna_. It is because _lokī catusaccasammāditthi ñāna_ has been described as _aparappaccaya ñāna_ by the Buddha in Kiccānagutta Suttana, and this **_aparappaccaya ñāna_** explained as **_attapaccekkha ñāna_** by atthakathā.

See Nibbānagāminipatipadā Vol. I in sections on Vipassanā, Udayabbayānupas- sanā for clarity of the Four Noble Truth during period of _lokīvipassanā_. Similarly for discerning on the past and future sankhāra by _anvaya ñāna_ which always follows the _vippasanā sammāditthi ñāna_ is given in section on Vipassanā, Udayabbayānupassanā, Bhañgānupassanā.

**_Lokīcatusaccasammādi_._t_._t_ _hi_**

The Buddha has critically analyzed the Eight Maggañ Dhamma in sections on Dhammānupassanā, Magga saccā of Mahāsatipatthā Suttāna. Among these eight, Sammāditthi has been classed as four groups.

_Katamā ca bhikkave sammāditthi_. _Yam kho bhikkave dukkhe ñānam_, _dukkha- samudaye ñānam_, _dukkhanirodheñānam_, _dukkhanirodhagāminiyā ñānam_. _Ayam vuccati_ _bhikkhave sammāditthi_ (_Ma_.1: 88).

Bbikkhus …. What is _sammāditthi_? Bhikkhus … The following four knowledges are the _sammāditthi_ (_Ma_.1: 88).

1. The knowledge that recognizes the _dukkha saccā_.
1. The knowledge that recognizes the _samudaya saccā_ which is the cause of _dukkha_.
1. The knowledge that recognizes the _nirodha saccā_ of _dukkha_.
1. The knowledge that recognizes the _magga saccā_ which is leads to _Nibbāna_ where _dukkha_ has been eradicated (the practice laeding to the Path for attainment of Nibbāna).

**Discussion of Early Great Mathera**

In this _satipatthāna desanā_ the Buddha has discussed on eight-fold maggañ and treated each analytically in the section on _magga saccā_. On this fact there had been a discussion, called dhammasākicchā among the great matheras. The discussion on the practice of _satipatthāna_ on the eight _maggañ_ classes in Mahāsatipatthāna Suttana was

 focussed upon as to whether

1. Pubbāsatipathānamagga = is the lokīsatipathāna to be practiced prior to attaining the ariya magga or
1. Has it been sermoned as combined _lokīlokuttara_ called _missakamagga_.

The mathera Tipitkacūlanāga said it is _pubbāgasatipatthāna magga_ = the _satipatthāna_ _magga_ which has to be fulfilled prior to acquring _ariya magga_. The Tipitakacūla _mathera_, the teacher of Tipitakasūlanāga mathera, has indicated _missakamagga_ as the _pubbāgasatipatthāna magga_, a combination of both _lokīsatipatthāna magga_ and _lokut_- _tarasatipatthā magga_. But Tipitakasūlanāga mathera, as a student replied that it is the _pubbāgasatipatthāna magga_, and the teacher repeatedly said it is the _missakamagga_. Because of this repeated sermon by the teacher, the student does not prevent hom from doing so but has to remain quiet.

Later Tipitakacūla _mathera_, in an attempt to find the right answer, recited the Mahāsatipatthāna Pāli and found in its conclusion that the Buddha has admittedly state the right answer.

_Yo hi koci bhikkhave ime cattaro satipatthāne evum bhāveya satta vassāni .._ (_Ma_.-1: 90)

 Bhikkave …. If a certain meditating monk meditated on the 4-fold _satipatthāna_, as I have instructed, for seven years (… he could attain either _arahatta magga_ or, if there still are remnant _kilesā_, _anāgāmi magga_). When he arrived at this stanza, he came to realize what the right answer is.

_Lokuttaramaggo upajjitvā satta vassaāni titthamāno nāma natthi_ (_Ma_.-_Tha_.-1: 235).

_Lokuttarāmagga_ is not going to remain throughtout the seven years’ duration (_Ma_.-_Tha_.-1: 235).

The Buddha decisively expounded as “the _missaka magga_ I have mentioned is not attainable in the Mahāsatipatthāna Suttan, but only the _pubbāgasatipatthāna magga_ is, as Culanāga has realized” (_Ma_.-_Tha_.-1: 235).

In this pubbabhāsatipatthāna magga are included the four kinds of _sammāditthi ñāna_ too. These four are the kinds of knowledge that a meditator must have exercised

and acquired before arriving at the the _ariya magga_.

1. The five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_, existing as the past, future, present, _ejjatta_,

_bahiddha_, _olārika_, _sukhuma_, _hīna_, _panīta_, _dūra_, _santika_, of 11 kinds, is the _dhammas_ of _dukkha saccā_. The _attapaccakkha ñāna_, which can penetratively visualize this _dukha saccā_, is the _sammāditthi_, which has the ability to understand in the _dukkha saccā_ via the knowledge of _dukkhe ñāna_. The meditator must have acquired this _sammāditthi_ before attaining the _ariya magga_. By acquiring these knowledge in this way, the factors of the _dukkha saccā dhamma_ can be visioned penetratively by virtue of _sammāditthi ñāna_ called **_attapaccakkha ñāna_**. Now the meditator is on the path leading to the _nibbāna_. Note that in this _dukkha saccā_ group are included the past and future five-fold _upādānak_- _khandhās_.

2. The _upādānakkhandha_, _kilesavatta_, _upādānakkhandhā_ and _sankhāra_-_kamma_ called

_kamma vatta upādābakkhandhā_, headed by _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_ and which are the causes of five-fold _paccuppan patisandhekhandhā_ etc. of five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_, are, in accordance with the _dhamma_ – _atīte hetavo pañca_ – etc., the *upādānakkhandhā*s of the past period. Again, _kilesa vatta upādānakkhandhā_, _kammavatta upādādankkhan_- _dhā_ cultivated in the present life, the causes due to which there will appear resultant _upādānakkhandhā_ termed _jāti_ (_jarāmarana_) are the _idāhi hetavo pañca_, _āyatim phalapañca_ _desanā_, and according to which they are just the _upādānakkhandhā_ of the future period.

The conspicuous resultant formation of five-fold _paccuppannavipākavatta_ _vipā_- _ka vatta upādānakkhandhā_ due to the past _upādānakkhandhā_ called _kilesavatta kamma- vatta_ as the cause, and because of culture of _kilesavatta kammavatta upādānakkhandhā_ in the present period has resulted in _vipākavatta upādānakkhandhā_ to come, are to be known penetratively by oneself. **_Attapaccakkha ñāna,_** which penetratively visualizes these, is the _sammāditthi ñāna_ which enables one to see the cause of _dukka saccā_ in accordance with _dukkhasamudaye ñānam_. The meditator must have already acquired this _sammāditthi ñāna_ view before attainment of _ariya magga_.

In such an endeavour should one employ _anvaya ñāna_ which sees by speculation, or by _attapacakkha ñāna_ which sees penetratively oneself? See the following.

_Aparapaccayo ñānamevassa ettha hoti_ (_Sam_.-1: 258).

**\*Aparappaccayā**ti na aparappaccayena*, *aññassa apattiyāyetvā attapaccakkhañāna- mevassa ettha ahotīti* (*Sam.*-*Ttha\*.2: 32).

According to this doctrine, it is not to be tried by _anvaya ñāna_ which sees by _anumāna_ speculative vision. It is not the knowledge handed down from one’s teacher nor that received from others. The endeavour must be made by **_attapaccakkha ñāna_** which is seen penetratively by oneself.

According to **_Ãhārasuttana_** (_Sam_.-1: 253) _desana_ method, the knowledge can be oriented toward the past it is possible to discern on _paticca samuppāda_, the cause-result relationship. (For a detail description see section on Paticca Samuppāda). (It does not necessarily mean to discern on all samsāric circus).

3. _Attapaccakkha ñāna_ which can discern on the formation of resultants _vipākavatta_

_upādānakkhandhā_ from causes _avijja_. _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_, _kamma_ etc. is **_Paccaya- to udayadassana ñāna_**. Because _janaka_ factors, which can directly give rise to the _upā_- _dānakkhandha_, can be dicerned penetratively by the knowledge _paccayato udayadassana ñāna_, **_samudaya saccā_** becomes clear (_Visuddhi_-2: 267).

4. Because of the _arahattamagga_, the causes like _avijja_. _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_,

_kamma_ etc. have ceased by nature of _asesavirāga_ and _anuppādanirodha_ in such a way that they are non-returnable, non-reappearable. Due to this cessation the future _khandhās_ also ceased by non-returnable dissolution after _khandhaparinibbāna_ (passing away of the aggregates). The knowledge that can recognize this kind of cessation is **_paccayato vayadassana ñāna_**. Combination of the _paccayato_ _udayadassan ñāna_ and _paccayato_ _vayadassana ñāna_ is the **_udayabbayadassana ñāna_**.

Here too, for a meditator at worldling stage and when the _udayabbaya ñāna_ is in force the time to attain _ariyamagga_ and to enter _parinibbāna_ will just be the future. This future may either be the future of the present existance, any one life that is to come. A meditator must attempt to acquire the knowledge that understands penetratively, by himself through _attapaccakkha ñāna_, the fact that because of the cessation of causes via _anuppādanirodha_, the resultant aggregates cease by way of _anuppādanirodha_. The meaning of this _anuppādanirodha_ is the **_lokīnirodhasaccā dhamma_**. Because of the penetrative vision of the dissolution of derived resultants due to cessation of the causes by way of the _anuppādanirodha_, the _nirodha saccā dhamma_ becomes clear by virtue of _paccayto_ _vayadassana ñāna_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 267).

The knowledge that can discern the formation of the cause _upādānakkhandha_ and

the resultant _upādānakkhandha_ is the _khanato udayadassana ñāna_. The **_dukkha saccā_** becomes clear because of penetrative vision of _jātidukkha_ (suffering of rebirth), the form- tion of _upādānakkhandhas_ by means of knowledge of _udayadassana ñāna_. The knowledge that can discern the dissolution of these _upādānakkhandhas_ is the _khanato vayadassana ñāna_. As the _khanato vayadassana ñāna_ penetratively understands the _maranadukkha_, the incessant dissolution of _upādānakkhandhas_, even the **_dukkha saccā_** become clear (_Visuddhi_-2: 267). These are the knowledges that understand the formation of _dukkha_ of the _upādānakkhandhas_, called the _dukkha saccā_. The _khanato udayadassana_ _ñāna_ and _khanato udaydassan ñāna_, when combined, become **_khanato udayabbaya dassana ñāna_**.

The above two kinds of _udayabbayadassana ñāna_ vision referred to as _paccayato udayabbayadassana_ and _khanato udayabbaya dassana_ are the _vipassanāditthi_. This _vipassanāditthi_—_paccayato udayabbaya_ and _khanto udayabbaya_, called the two _udayab_- _baya_ of the _sankhāra dhammas_, can momentarily eradicate the _sammoha dhammas_ which hinder visualizing these two. It is, therefore, the _lokīsaccā dhammas_. Because of the knowledge of vision by these two _udayabbaya_ _ñāna_ the **_lokīmagga saccā dhamma_** becomes clear in the continuum of a meditator (_Visuddhi_-2: 268).

By _Arūpasattaka vipassanā_ method of meditation – when the past _manodvārika vipassanājovīthi nāma dhamma_, called pre-_citta_, can be discerned by post-_citta_ called later _vipassanā manodvārika vipassanājovīthi nāma dhamma_, and when _vipassanā ñāna_,

called _ñāna_ = _manodvārika vipassanājovīthi nāma dhamma_ can be discerned again by _bhañgānupassanā_, the _lokīmagga saccā dhamma_ becomes apparent. (For the method of meditation see section on Vipassanā meditation).

This is how four-fold _lokīsaccā_ is acquired by means of _vipassanāditthi_ during exercising the _lokīvipassanā_. This _vipassanāditthi_ called _attapaccakkha ñāna_ is one of the eight-fold _lokīmaggañ dhamma_. In Mahāsatipatthāna Suttana the Buddha has

 instructed to acquire _pubbagasatipatthāna magga_ prior to attaining _ariya magga_.

A meditator might have wondered if there have ever been disciples who have penetratively visioned _lokasamudaya_ and _lokanirodha dhammas_ by _sammāditthi ñāna_, called _paccakkha ñāna_, after exercising along the line of these instructions. If so, then go through the extracts from **_Mahātahnāsañkhaya Suttana_** given below.

Bhikkhus …. Do you ever discern, by _vipassanāsammāditthi ñāna_, that this five- fold _khandhas_ (5-fold aggregates) have appeared clearly?, asked the Buddha.

We do, my Lord, reply the bhikkhus.

Bhikkhus …. Do you ever discern, by _vipassnāsammāditthi ñāna_, that this 5-fold aggregate appear as a result of the causes that clearly exist?, ask the Buddha.

My Lord, we do, reply the bhikkhus.

Bhikkhus …. Do you ever discern that the resultant _khandha_ possesses the nature of cessation by _anuppādanirodha_ because the causes cease by way of _anuppādanirodha_? Ask the Buddha.

We do, my Lord, reply the bhikkhus (_Ma_.-1: 326).

These _bhikkhus_ penetratively know the fact that _sankhāra_ is formed because of _avijjā_ formation, and because of _sankhāra_, _viñāna_ is formed, etc. of the processes of the _sankhāraloka_ referred to as _anuloma paccayākāra_ = _anulomapaticca samuppāda_, the nature of the _lokasamudaya_, because of _arahatta magga_ of _avijjā_ the nature of the _asesavirāga_ = the nature of absolute and non-returnable cessation by way of the nature of _anuppādanirodha_. (For a broader description, see (_Ma_.-1: 327).

With regard to attaining the vision of _vipassanā sammāditthi ñāna_, the Buddha has made many questions to these bhikkhus. From among these question and answers, some which are relevent are given.

**Questions and Answers**

The Bhuddha ask the Bhikkhus …. If you have indeed acquired knowledge and sight this way “ do you say the Buddha, as our teacher, is respectable, and with due respect to the Bhuddha we state this way?”

No, our Lord, we do not state this way, was the answer from the Bhikkhus.

Bhikkhus …. If you have indeed acquired knowledge and sight this way, do you state that “the Buddha as a _samana_ has expatiated this way, and we the _samana_ have said this way?”

No, our Lord, we do not state this way.

Bhikkhus …. If you have indeed acquired knowledge and sight this way, do you relay these to other teachers?

No, our Lord, we do not.

Bhikkhus …. If you have indeed acquired knowledge and sight this way, could these be, in essence, from the discipline and _kotuhala mañgalā_ of many _samana_ and

 _byahmana_ ?

No, our Lord, it could not be.

Bhikkhus …. Do you mean knowing and seeing by your self by means of _Sammāditthipaññā cakkhu_ ( knowlwedge by eye of right understanding) called _attapac- cakkha ñāna_?

Yes, our Lord, we do.

Bhikkhus … _Sadhu_ = good. Bhikkhus …. With this _dhamma_, which you can see by yourself, which can bringforth benefit any time, which is an ideal to demonstrate to others, which should be maintained within your body and mind, which only the learned individuals can know and appreciate, I have directed you, my sons, to the _nibbāna_ (to have approached the _nibbāna_). Bhikkhus …. This is the _dhamma_, which you should discern; it can bring-forth benefit any time; it is demonstrable to others to exercise; it should be maintained with one’s body and mind; only the learned individuals can know and appreciate. In this way I have preached to you. I preach this _dhamma_ with reference to the fact that you have distinctly know by own (_Ma._-1: 332).\*

**_Sampati Dittha Sankhāra, Sampati Adittha Sankhāra_**

After going through various explanations given above, and if the meditator under- stands and contended with, he will also agree with the the division of the past and future _sankhāra dhammas_ into two classes as given below.

Among the characters of the _paticca samuppāda dhammas_ from the _avijjā_ to _jaramarana_ are included the _dhamma_ groups of the past period, of the future and of the present. Similarly among the _samudaya dhamma_ groups are included the past causes called _dhamma_ groups of the past period, of the future and of the present. A meditator should partly acquire the knowledge of the characters of the _paticca samuppāda_ and the nature of interrelationship among these characters relative to meditator’s _pāramī_ _ñāna_. This knowledge is acquired by _vipassanā sammāditthi ñāna_ called the _attapaccakkha ñāna_.

Again according to method of _saccādesanā_ – among the _dukkha saccādhamma_ groups are included resultants of the past, future and the present referred to as _dhamma_ of the past period, of the future period and of the present period. In the same way, among the _samudaya saccā dhamma_ groups are included the past cause referred to as past period _dhammas_, the present cause referred to as the present period _dhammas_, and for those who are still continuing the infinite rounds of rebirth, the future cause referred to as future period _dhammas_.

In the accounts of _lokīnirodhasaccā_ are included the future _dhamma_ groups for the one who is going to pass away in the present life, and later future _dhamma_ for the one who is going to pass away in any one of the future lives. The _lokīmagga saccā dhamma_ is the process of _vipassanā manodvārika jovīthi_ dictated by the practising _vipassanā sammāditthi ñāna_ and is therefore the _dhamma_ groups of the present period. The _sāvakas_ should have tried to discern penetratively the four-fold _lokīmagga saccā_ in part, before arriving at* the *ariamagga* with their corresponding *pārami*s via *attapaccakkha ñāna*, referred to as *vipassanā sammāditthi ñāna*, which occur prior to *ariyamagga\*.

The above mentioned past, future (and present) _sankhāra dhammas_ discerned via the _attapaccakkha ñāna_, referred to as _vipassanā sammāditthi ñāna_, are the **\*sampati dittha sankhāra** dhammas*. The journey through the sasāric circus is too long for a sāvaka to have discenred these *dhammas* completely. Those *dhammas* that have not been discerned by the *attapaccakkha ñāna*, referred to as *vipassanā sammāditthi ñāna\*, are the **\*sampati adittha sankhāra** dhammas*. A meditator who has completed discerning the *sampati dittha sankhāra dhammas*, can do so in a similar way for the past and future *sampati adittha sankhāra dhammas* by knowledge of *anvaya ñāna*. It must be noted that this *anvaya ñāna* is the knowledge not included in *vipassanā sammāditthi ñāna*, called *attapaccakkha ñāna\*, but a kind of **_paccakkhan ñāna_** that always follows the _vipassanā ñāna_.

Only if the past, future and present _sankhāra dhammas_ are taken to be of two classes as _sampti ditthi sankhāra_ and _sampti aditthi sankhāra_, can the solution can be made. If all the past and present _sankhāra dhammas_ are blindly accepted as discernible by _anumāna_ only by _anvaya ñāna_, then the expations in relation to the penetrative knowledge by the _vipassanā sammāditthi ñāna_, called _attapaccakkha ñāna_ of the nature\** of the relationship of the *paticca samuppāda*, and of four-fold *lokīsaccā\*, would be of no meaning. The learned may sometimes have overlooked the fact.

If the division of the past and future *sankhāra*s into the past and future _sampti dittha_ and *sampti adittha sankhāra*s cannot be accepted, then the ofllowing expressions from Patisambhidhā Magga Pāli.

_Jātā avijjā paccuppannā_, _sattā nibbattilakkhanam vayo_, _anupassanā ñānam_. R. _Jāto bhavo paccuppanno_, _tassa nibbattilakkhanam udayo_, _viparināmalakkhanam vayo_, _anupassanā ñānam_ (_Patisam._- 52).

[Even *paramatthadhammasabhāvalakkhanā*, called the material body formation clearly as *upāda*-*thī*-*bhañga*, is said to have attained *patiladdhattabhāva* = *attabho*.]

 The _paramatthadhammasabhāvalakkhanā_ while in its formative stage, called _avijjā_ which is (one’s own form) still attaining is the _paccuppanna dhamma_. The _sañkhatalakkhanā_ which should be taken arising stage of _avijjā_ is the _udaya_ = arising. The _sankhatalakkhanā_ which is taken as deterioration is the perishing away = noted as the _vaya_. The _nupassanā_ knowledge of concentration on the _udaya_ and _vaya_ time and again is the _udayabbayānupassanā ñāna_. R.

The _paramatthadhammasabhāvalakkhanā_ while in its formative stage, the _bhava_

(called _kammabhava_ + _upapattibhava_) still attaining, is the _paccuppanna dhamma_. The _asañkhatalakkhanāI,_ which can be taken as the arsing stage of that _bhava_ is the arising = noted as the _udaya_. The _sankhatalakkhanā_ which is taken as deterioration is the perishing away = noted as the _vaya_. The _nupassanā_ knowledge of concentration on the

_udaya_ and _vaya_ time and again is the _udayabbayānupassanā ñāna_ (_Patisam_.- 52).

If a breakdown is made of the characters of the _paticca samuppāda_ with the _paccuppanna bhava_ in the middle, then _avijjā_, _sañkhāra dhammas_ etc. are the _dhamma_ groups of the past period. _Upapattibhava_ referred to as _jāti_ is the _dhamma_ groups that belong to the future period. The _viññāna_, _nāma_-_rūpa_, _salāyatana_, _phassa_, _vedanā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_ and _kamma bhava_ are all _dhamma_ groups belonging to the preent period.

These _dhammas_, however, are *dhamma*s that have arisen, arising, and still to arise as _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañga_. These _dhammas_ are still included in the three *khana*s of _upāda_-_thī_- _bhañga_ duration, and still staitc in these three *khana*s. And during these three periods the _paramatthadhammasabhāvalakkhanā_ referred to as the _paramattha_ material body, the _attabho_, are momentarily acquired and therefore termed as the _paccuppanna dhamma_.

What it really means is this. It is true that avijjā is the _dhamma_ of past period. It has then existed clearly in the form of _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañga_. While existing so during that period, that _avijjā_ is referred to as the _paccuppanna dhamma_. When the meditator discerns this _avijjā_ via _udayabbayānupassanā ñāna_, he must concentrate on, and acquire, the arising phase _upāda_ and perishing phase _bhañga_ of this _avijjā_. If one can concentrate on the arising and perishing away of the _avijjā_, then that _udayabbayānupassanā ñāna_ is referred to be concentrating on the _avijjā_ of the present period. Note that the same applies the concnetration on the characters of the _paticcasamuppāda_ during remaining three periods. In connection with this _paccuppanna dhamma_ the great teacher of the doctrine opened as follows. It has been translated by Pye Sayādaw.

_Nayadassanavasena vā evum vuttam_. _Pathamahñi paccuppannadhammānam udayabbayam disvā atha atītānāgate nayam neti_ (_Mahātī_.-2: 423).\*

In another way — by nayadassana it means this way. To begin with acquire the _udayabbaya_ by _paccakkha_, and later the same applies for the past and future periods (Pyī.- Visuddhi Nissaya – 5: 165).

**What _Paticcasamuppāda Dhamma_ Is**

This cause-result relationship = _paticca samuppāda dhamma_ was not created by the Buddha himself. Whether or not the Buddhas, named _tathāgata_ (one who has found the truth), have appeared in this _loka_ (world), this causal relationship = _paticca samuppāda dhamma_ will still exist in this world. But only when *sammāsambuddha*s (the perfectly enlightened ones), named _tathāgata_, have appeared in this world expounded the cause-result relationship = _paticca samuppāda dhamma_, the sentient beings have the chance to know it (Sam.-1: 246. See Paccaya Suttan).

Suppose the Buddha has not appeared in this world, or the Buddha has appeared but sentient beings have not the chance to listen to his teaching, or they have did have the chance but were under the influence of such extreme beliefs as _sassataditthi_ and _ucchedaditthi_, then they would not be able to understand the _paticcasamuppādha dhamma_.

This cause-result relationship = _paticcasamuppādha dhamma_ have deep meaning. It is hard to understand. To the Venerable Ãnanda, who expressed _paticcasamuppādha_ to be simple and shallow, was cautioned by the Buddha as “Māhevum Ãnanda māhevum Ãnanda, my young brother Ãnanda do not say this way, Ãnanda do not say this way.” (_Dī_.- _Sam_.- 2: 47; _Sam_.-1: 318).

However hard and deep it may be, the _paticcāsamuppāda dhamma_ will have to be clearly and analytically understood by _attapaccakkha ñāna_ and _sammāditthi ñāna_ etc. of the three _pariññā_. Without penetratively understanding this way escape from vicious rounds of rebirth, ageing, suffering, the death and recurrent of rebirths. Without the knowledge of the cause-result relationship = _paticcasamuppāda dhamma_, no one should be recognized as _samanabyāmana_ (see _Sam_.- 1: 255 – 256).

The Buddhas, who have arisen, arising and going to arise know the this _paticca_ _samuppāda dhamma_ analytically, and that is the reason why they are able to have arisen, still arising and going to arise. As long as the sentient beings are ignorant of the _paticca_ _samuppāda dhamma_, they will be under influence of the _sassataditthi_ and _ucchedaditthi_ and will still be bounded by miserable suffering. Therefore, those who want to escape from various _sansāravatta dukkhas_ must try to penetratively understand the _paticca_ _samuppāda_ via _sammāditthi ñāna_ called _attapaccakkha ñāna_. This has many times been advised in Nidānavaggasamyutta *desana*s (see _Sam_.-1: 257; Kiccānagutta Suttana etc.).

**_Tadanvaya Dhammas in Patisambhidāmagga Pāli_**

_Aniccato manasikaroto adhimokkhabahulassa sandañdariyam ādhipateyam hoti_, _bhāvanā cattārañdariyāni tadanvayā honti_, _sahajātapaccayā honti_, _aññamaññapaccayā_

_honti_, _nissayapaccayā honti_, _sampayuttapaccayā honti_, _ekarasā hoti_, _ekarasatthena bhāvana_, _yo sammāpatipanno_, _so bhāveti_, _natthi micchāpatipannassa idariyabhāvanā_. _Dukkhato mansikaroto passaddhibahulassa samādhiñdariyam ādhipateyam hoti_. R. _Anattato mansikaroto vedabahulassa pañiñdariyam ādhipateyam hoti_. R. (*Patisam.*245-246).

**\*Tadanvāyā hontī**ti tam anugāmini tam anuvattinī honti* (*Patisam\*.-Tha.-2: 161).

The _sankhāra dhammas_ taken to heart as _anicca_, and the determination as _anicca_

-   in individual with high _adhimocka_ (_saddhārimockkha_) determination (deter-mined faith), _saddhindriye_ (faculty of faith) is his principle. In _vipassanā_ meditation the four- fold *indriya*s (controlling principles), such as effort, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom, are always associated with that principle. R.

The _sankhāra dhammas_ taken to heart as _dukkha_ is peacefulness = in one who is fully relaxed _sammādhindre_ (faculty of concentration) is his principle. In the _vipassanā_ meditation the the four-fold *indriya*s (faith, effort, mindfulness, wisdom), are always associated with that principle. R.

In wise individual who takes the _sankhāra dhammas_ to heart as _anatta_, in him _paññindre_ (faculty of widom) is the principle. In the _vipassanā_ meditation the the four- fold *indriya*s (faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration), are always associated with that principle. R. The are _sahajāta_-_paccaya_ (conascence condition), _aññamañña_-_paccaya_ (mutuality condition), _nissaya_-_paccaya_ (dependence condition), _sampayutta_-_paccaya_ (relation of association) and functional similarity. From sense of functional similarity, it is the _bhāvanā_ (mental culture). A meditator practises on good exercise termed _sammā_- _patipanna_ (having the right view). The meditator is taken as practising for maturity of _indre_, referred to as _indriyabhāvana_ (power of mental culture). A certain individual practises concentration on micchāpatipatta procedure. Then he cannot be taken as taken as practising for maturity of _indre_, referred to as _indriyabhāvana_ (*Patisam.*245-246).

There are fve classes of _indre_: _saddhā_ (faith), _vīriya_ (effort), _sati_ (mindfulness), _sammādhi_ (concentration) and _paññā_ (wisdom). Then any one who takes the _sankhāra_ _dhammas_ as _anicca_ and concentrate on it, the _saddhindre_ is his principle. To this are associated the the four-fold _indre_: _vīriya_, _sati_, _sammādhi_ and _paññā_. This _saddhā_ and the four-fold _indre_ arise in association with each other within a _cittakhana_ (thought moment). _Saddhā_ supported these four by force of _sahajāta_, _aññamañña_, _nissaya_ and _sampayutta_. Therefore, these four-fold _indre_ have been expounded to be **_tadanvayadhamma_** which is associated with _sammādhindre_.

In an individual who takes _sankhāra dhammas_ as _anatta_ to heart, the _paññañdre_ is his principle. The _indre_ such as _saddhā_, _vīriya_, _sati_, _sammādhi_ are always associated with the _paññañdre_. This _paññañdre_ supports these four via the forces of _sahajāta_, _aññamñña_, _nissaya_ and _sampayuttapaccaya_. Therefore, these four-fold _indre_ are always associated with the _paññañdre_ and are expatiated as **_tadanvayadhamma_**.

These ***tadanvayadhamma*s** are the _dhammas_ (mental perception of _vipassanā_) formed in association with, and in reciprocal support of each other, by way of _sahajāta_, _aññamñña_, _nissaya_ and _sampayuttapaccaya_, within a _vipassanājo_ and a _cittakhana_.

It is not the kind of _anvaya ñāna_ referred to as analytic _paccavekkhana ñāna_, nor included in the _vipassanāditthi ñāna_, which always arises in associated with _vipassanāsammāditthi_ _ñāna_ called the _attapaccakkha ñāna_ as explained above. It is neither the kind of _anvaya ñāna_, referred to as _paccavekkha ñāna_, always formed in association with _lokuttaramagga ñāna_ and _lokuttaraphala ñāna_ nor is it included in

 _ariyamagga ñāna_ and _ariyaphala ñāna_.

**_Anvaya Ñāna_ that is always associated with _Ariyamagga Ñāna_**

In **Ñanavatthu Suttan** of Nidānavaggasamyutta Pāli the Buddha indicated (44) kinds of *sampatti*s (sustained deep mental absorption) existing termed as _ñānavatthu_ (mental material) knolwedge. The 11 characters of the _paticcasamuppāda_ from _jarāmarana_ through _sankhāra_ have been expatiated to be endowed with four kinds of knowledge. Altogether there will be (11 x 4 = 44) _ñānavatthu_. Here some examples will be presented.

1. _Jarāmarana ñānam_ = the knowledge that understands the _jarāmarana_,
1. _Jarāmaranasamudaye ñānam_ = the knowledge which understands the origin of the _jarāmarana_,
1. _Jarāmarananirodha ñānam_ =* the knowledge that understands the cessation of the *jarāmarana\*,
1. _Jarāmarananirodhagāminiyā patipadāya ñānam_ = the knowledge that understands the _nirodha saccā,_ the truth of cessation of the _jarāmarana_ = the*  
   \*
    knowledge that* understands the practice of attainment of _nibbāna_. R.\*

1. _Sankhāresu ñānam_ = the knowledge that understands the *sankhāra*s,
1. _Sankhārasamudaye ñānam_ = the knowledge that understands the origin of the *sankhāra*s,
1. _Sankhāranirodha ñānam_ = the knowledge that understands the _nirodha saccā_, the truth of cessation, of _sankhāras_,
1. _Sankhāranirodhagāminiya patipadāya ñānam_ = the knowledge that understands the _nirodha_, the cessation, of *sankhāra*s = the knowledge that understands the \*
    practice leading to _nibbāna_.

This is how each character of _paticcasamuppāda_ has the four _saccā_ (truth) giving a total of (44) 11 characters.

1. _Jarāmarana_ refers to the aggregates which have the nature of _jarāmarana_ (ageing, decay and death). The expression that knowledge that understands the _jarāmarana_ refers to the knowledge which understands _dukkha saccā_ (truth of suffering) of _upādānakkhandhā_ (the clinging aggregate), which have the nature of _jarāmarana_.
1. _Samudaya_ which is the cause of _jarāmarana_ is _jāti_. _Jāti_ is the beginning of life which has the nature of _jāti_ or the nature of _upāda_ (arising). The knowledge that understands this _jāti_ is knowledge that understands the _samudaya_ (arising) of the cause of _jarāmarana_.
1. _Jarāmarananirodha dhamma_ is the _nibbāna_. This _nibbāna_ = the knowledge that understands the _nirodha saccā_ is the knowledge that understands the _marananiro_-

 _dha saccā_.

4. _Jarāmarannirodhagāminipatipadā_ is the eight-fold _ariyamagga_ (Noble Eight-fold Path) related _to ariyamagga_ (the Noble Path). The knowledge that understands the Noble Eight-fold Path is the knowledge that understands the practice leading to the _nibbāna_ where _jarāmarana_ has ceased.

The origin of _jāti_ is the _kamma bhava_ (sensual existance); the origin of existance is the _upādāna_ (clinging to existance); the origin of _upādāna_ is _tahnā_ (craving); the origin of _tahnā_ is the _vedanā_ (feeling); the origin of _vedanā_ is _phassa_ (contact); the origin of the _phassa_ is the _sa_._l_ _āyatana_ (sense bases); the origin of _sa_._l_ _āyatana_ is the _nāma_-_rūpa_ (mind and matter); the origin of _nāma_-_rūpa_ is the _viññāna_ (perception); the origin of _viñ_- _ñāna_ is the _sankhāra_; and the origin of _sankhāra_ is the _avijjā_ (ignorance). This is distinct. In this way each of the 11 characters of _paticca samuppāda_ has four factors, making it (44) mental properties altogether. (See _Sam_.-1: 288 - 290 for a broader treatment).

Again in the same Suttana the Buddha has preached on the arising of _anvaya ñāna_

 in this way.

_Yato kho bhikkhave ariyasāvako evum jarāmaranam pajānāti_, _evum jarāmaranasamu- dayam pajānāti_, _evum jarāmarananirodham pajānāti_, _evum jarāmarananirodhagāminin patipadam pajānāti_. _Dhamme ñānam so iminā dhammena viditena akālikena pattena_

 _pariyogāh_._l_ _ena atītānāgate nayam neti_ (_Sam._-1: 289).

_Ettha ca na catusaccadhammena vā sakkā atītānāgate nayam netum_, _catucassena pana maggañānena patividdhe parato paccavekkhañānam nāma hoti_, _tena nayam netīti veditabbā_ (_Sam_.-_Tha_.-2: 62).

Bhikkhus …. An _ariyasāvaka_ (Noble Disciple) knows the following.

1. He understands the _jarāmarana_,
1. He understands the _samudaya_ as the cause of _jarāmarana_,
1. He understands the _nibbāna dhamma_ as the truth of cessation of the _jarāmarana_,
1. He understands the _magga saccā_ which is the practice leading to attainment of

 _nirodhanibbāna_ where _jarāmaran_ has ceased.

 This the **_dhamma ñāna_** of the _ariyasāvaka_ = the _ariyamagga ñāna_ (knowledge of Noble Path) which understands the _catusaccadhamma_ (dhamma of Four Noble Truth). This _ariyasāvaka_, _ariyamagga ñāna cakkhu_ (eye of wisdom for Noble Path) (by nature of _asammohapativedha_), that is sighted by _paccakkha_, that is to be understood by _ariyamagga paññā_, that could result any time (= by one’s own _ariyamagga_ after which ariyaphala could result any time), attaining the Four Noble Truth by means of which the _catusaccadhamma_ is acquired, by this _catusaccādhamma_ contained in it by _ariyamagga_ _ñāna_ or in other words by _ariyamagga ñāna_ which penetratively understands the _catusac_- _cadhamma_, and applicable also in past and future, i.e arrives at the _paccavekkhanā ñāna_ that understands the four-fold _saccādhamma_ of the past and the future (_Sam_.-1: 289).

In the past these *samanabyāmana*s understood the _jarāmarana_, _jarāmaranasamu- daya_, _jarāmarananirodha_, the way of practice leading to _jarāmarananirodha_. They

 understood these the way I do today.

 In future too, these *samanabyāmana*s will understand the _jarāmarana_, _jarāmarana_- _samudaya_, _jarāmarananirodha_, practice leading to _jarāmarananirodha_. These *samana- byāmana*s will understand the way I do today. The same applies to the knowledge in the past and present. This the **_anvaya ñāna_**, which is always associated with _ariayamagga ñāna_.

Bhikkhus …. An _ariyasāvaka_, at a certain time can be taken as one who possesses the _dhamma ñāna_ called _ariyamagga ñāna_ which understands the _ariya sacca dhammas_ by virtue of _asamohapativedha_, the anvaya ñāna called the _paccavekkhana ñāna_ which understands the association with _ariyamagga ñāna_, and these two *ñāna*s are untainted and clean. Bhikkhus …. Then this _sāvaka_ can be taken as one complete with right view, right eye of wisdom, who has acquired the _dhamma_ of morally good people, who has the sight of this dhamma, competant with eye of wisdom and _sikkha ñāna_ still practicing, competant with eye of wisdom and _vijjā ñāna_ still practicing, well attained the peaceful _dhamma_, one with _ariyapaññā_ (Noble Knowledge) which eradicates the mass of _kilesā_, and one at the door to the _nibbāna_ (_Sam_.1: 289).

This _anvaya ñāna_ is the kind of knowledge which is always associated with _ariya_-_magga ñāna_ or _ariyamaggañānaphalañāna_. When you have understood the 4-fold _saccā_, then you can exercise on it as an object.

Among these *ñāna*s, which is the _dhamma ñāna_? The _paññā_ in four-fold _ariya_- _magga_ and four-fold _ariyaphala_ is the _dhamma ñāna_. The ariyasāvaka, by _ariyamagga_ _cakkhu ñāna_ referred to as _dhamma cakkhu_, that is visible and understandable via by nature of _asamohapativedha_, that give rise to result in no time, because of its existance to acquirement of the four-fold Noble Truth, that is to attain _catusaccadhamma_, that reflects _ariyamagga ñāna_, this _catusaccadhamma_ = by _maggañāna dhamma_ that penetratively understands _catusaccadhamma_, applicable to the past and future = aquires the _paccavek_- _khanā ñāna_ which understands the past and future four-fold Noble Truth.

In the past these *samana byāmana*s have penetratively understood the _dukkha_, the _dukkhasamudaya_, the _dukkhanirodha_, and the practice leading to _dukkhanirodha_. With the exception of _tahnā_, they have understood only the _tebhūmaka dhamma_ (_dhamma_ belonging to three stages of being) penetratively as _dukkha_. These *samana*s have understood only the _tahnā_ penetratively as _dukkha samudaya_. All these *samana*s have understood only the _asankhata dhātu_ (the absolute element) penetratively to be peaceful element, the _nibbāna dhamma_, as the _dukkhanirodha_. They all have understood this eight-fold _magga_ (Noble Path of Eight Contituents) _dhamma_ penetratively as the only exercise which could lead to _dukkhanirodha_.

In future too these _sammana byāmanas_ will understand penetratively the _dukkha_, _dukkha samudaya_, _dukkhanirodha_, and exercise leadding to _nirodha saccā_. With the exception of _tahnā_, they will understand only the _tebhūmaka dhamma_ penetratively as _dukkha_. These *samana*s will understand only the _tahnā_ penetratively as _dukkha samudaya_. All these *samana*s will understand only the _asankhata dhātu_ penetratively to be peaceful element, the _nibbāna dhamma_, as the _dukkhanirodha_. They all will understand this eight-fold _magga_ _dhamma_ penetratively as the only exercise which could lead to _dukkhanirodha_. In this case _paññā pajānana_. R. _Amoha dhamma vicaya_ _sammāditthi ñāna_ does appear. This knowledge should be called **_anvaya ñāna_** (_Abhi_.-2: 341-342).

_Yadetam iminā catusaccāgpcram maggañānam adhigatam_, _tena ñānena kāranabhūtena atītānāgate paccavekkhanañāna sankhātam nayam neti_ (*Abhi.-Tha.-*2: 398).

The _ariyamagga dhamma_ penetratively understands, by nature of _arammanapati_- _vedha_, the _nirodhasaccā nibbāna dhamma_ taking it directly as the object of meditation. By eradication of the _moha_ (ignorance), which hinder understanding the four _saccā_, remaining three _saccā_ and be understood penetratively by virtue of _asamhohapativedha_. Therefore, the _ariyamagga ñāna_ understands _nirodha saccā_ taking it as the object, by _kiccasaccā_ understand the remainining three *saccā*s; only the _magga ñāna_ can understand all the four *saccā*s. The _ariyamaggaphala ñāna_ is understands only the _nirodhasaccā_ by virtue of the nature of _arammanapativedha_ which is taken as the object. Referring to this kind of understanding, knowledge of _ariyamagga ñāna_ and of _ariyam_- _maggaphala ñāna_ has been indicated to be the _dhamma ñāna_ (*Abhi.-Tha.-*2: 398).

This meditator have acquired the _ariyamagga ñāna_ which has taken the four-fold _saccā_ as its object. Because of _ariyamagga ñāna_, _anvaya ñāna_, referred to as _paccavek_- _khana ñāna_, appears according to method applicable to concentration on the past and future. With this _anvaya ñāna_, the meditation can be made on both the past and future (*Abhi.- Tha.-*2: 398).

This _anvaya ñāna_ is just a kind of knowledge that is always associated with the _paccavekkhana ñāna_. This _anvaya ñāna_ is the _paccavekkhana ñāna_ which is always associated with _ariyamagga ñāna_ and _ariyaphala ñāna_, but not included in _attapacca- vekkha ñāna_ called _ariyamagga sammāditthi_.

In this way there are two _anvaya ñāna_, one which is associated with _vipassanā ñāna_ and one associated with _lokuttara ariyamagga ñāna_ and _ariyaphala ñāna_. This _anvaya ñāna_, however, is not a kind of _dhamma_ which occurs in association with either _ariyamagga ñāna_ nor _ariyaphala ñāna_ within a _cittakhana_ or a _jovīthi_. It is the kind of _paccavekkhana_ _ñāna_ which appears after arising of _vipassanājo_, _maggajo_, _vīthijo_, with an elapse of many *jovīthi*s.

The **\*anvaya ñāna** dhamma*s** in** the above mentioned Patisambhidāmagga Pāli are are not included in the two kinds of *anvaya ñāna*. The Buddha did not preach as *anvaya ñāna*, but as *tadanvaya dhamma*. These *tadanvaya dhamma*a are forceful *indriyabhāvanā dhamma*s which are formed in association within a *vipassanājo\* _cittakhana_, and in support of each other of the _sahajāta_, _aññamañña_, _nissaya_, _sampa- yutta_, and _paccaya_ forces.

Now extracts from *suttana*s\* such as Aparijānanasuttana will be described. **_Sabbam bhikkhave anbhijānam aparijānam avirājayam appajayam abhabbo dukkhakka-_**

_yāya_. R.

Bhikkhus …. If _rūpa_-_nāma dhamma_ (the five _upādānakkhandhā_ = 12 species of _āyatana_ =) are not understood completely by means of _ñātapariññā_, not analytically understood by _tīranapariññā_, and if the _tahnā_, which is clinging on to the _rūpa_-_nāma dhamma_, has not been eradicated completely by means of _pahānapariññā_, the _dukkha_ cannot be dissolved. R.

Bhikkhus …. If _rūpa_-_nāma dhamma_ (the five _upādānakkhandhā_ = 12 species of _āyatana_ =) are understood completely by means of _ñātapariññā_, analytically understood by _tīranapariññā_, and if the _tahnā_, which is clinging on to the _rūpa_-_nāma dhamma_, has been eradicated completely by means of _pahānapariññā_, then the _dukkha_ can be dissolved (*Sam.-Tha.-*3: 6).

_Paccakkhakaranattena ñātapariññā tīranapariññā ca gatitā hoti_ (_Sam_.-_Tī_.-2:65).

In accordance with this opening and _samvannanā_ (praises) the _pariññā paññā_ (knowledge) are the _attapaccakkhan ñānas_. These *pariññā*s will further be explained. In this case too, the _pariññā_ can be classed as _lokī pariññā_ and _lokuttara pariññā_. Again in the _lokī pariññā_ are _ñātapariññā_, _tīranapariññā_ and _pahānapariññā_ as three classes.

In _lokuttara pariññā_ also are _ñātapariññā_, _tīranapariññā_ and _pahānapariññā_. First the three _lokī pariññā_ will be presented.

**The _Lokī Ñātapariññā_**

_Tattha sankhārapricchedato patthāya yāva paccayapariggahā ñātapariññāya bhūmi_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 241).

Among those three *pariññā*s “_rūpa_ is the _dhamma_ that is subject to change, and _vedanā_ is the _dhamma_ which has the nature of suffering.” By having the ability to analytically understand the ultimate reality of each of the general characters of the five- fold _khandhā_, the knowledge which can analyse the mind and matter called _nāma_- _rūpapariccheda ñān_. _a_ is acquired. This knowledge plus the _paccayapariggaha ñā_._n_ _a_, which can canalyse and culture the causes and results in the past, future and present moments, are called the **_ñātapariññā_** (_Visuddhi_-2: 241).

_So_ “_idam_. _nāma-rūpam_. _na hetu na paccayā nibbattam_. , _sahetu sappaccayā nibbattam_. . _Ko kapmanmaaspsaa chceatyuā_, ,_k āoh pāarnaap apcaccacyaāy oc_”_āt_”_it iu ptaaspsaar pikakchcaanytaom_ .“ _avvaivjjaātpthaacpceatyvāā_,* “*taahtīnteāppia pcaccacyaay, ā\*

The meditator who has cultivated the five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_ = 12 _āyatana_ = _rūpa_-_nāma_ _dhammas_ analytically by means of knowledge to arrive at _paramatthadham_- _masabhāvalakkhan_. _ā_, should note that “it is not that the _nāma_-_rūpa_ is formed as a direct result of _hetu_ (the root) as a cause = _paccaya_ (condition) as a cause, without distinct j*u*a*p*n*a*a*t*k*th*a*a* _m_.( p*b*r*h*o*a*d*k*u*a*c* t(isounp)p, orwt)h aisc ha ccaouuseld.

is _hetu_ which is the direct cause of a result = the present of the d. istinct _janaka_ as a cause,

.

the _paccaya_ as a cause which is supportive = distinct _upatthambhaka_ as a cause. Then what are these causes called _hetu_ = _janaka_? If the supporting cause the _paccaya_ = _upat-_ _thambhaka_ are investigated

1. Because of the cause referred to as _avijjā_,
1. Because of the cause referred to as _tah_._n_ _ā_,
1. Because of the cause referred to as _kamma_,
1. Because of the cause referred to as _āhāra_,

the results appear, and when it is understood by penetrative knowledge, then because of _avijjā_, _kammaja rūpa_ (_rūpa_ produced by _kamma_) has resulted; the _avijjā_ is the cause, the _kammaja rūpa_ the result, ….

The causes and results are analytically recognized in this way—

1. In the past too there were causes and results.
1. In the future too there will be the causes and results.
1. In the present also there are the causes and results.

There is no creator other than the causes and consequences, nor is there any individual who has been created by a creator. The cause and result of _rūpa_-_nāma_ = only the _sankhāra dhamma_ groups are there — determination has been made via _paccakkha ñāna_ for which _vicikicchā_ in the past, future and the present (doubtful state) can be overcome. This is called **_ñātapariññā_** which can analytically recognize the _sankhāra_ _dhammas_ such as

1. _Rūpa dhamma_
1. _Nāma dhamma_
1. The cause
1. The result

 which are objects of concentration for the insight knowledge (_Abhi_.-_Ttha_.2: 241 – 242).

In accordance with the opening of the doctrines, only when the causes and results of the past, the future and the present periods can be cultivated analytically can the

 _ñātapariññā_ be acquired. This fact must be obediently maintained.

**_Lokī Tīranapariññā_**

“_Rūpam aniccam_, _vedanā aniccā_”_tiādinā nayena tesamyeva dhammānam sāmañña- lakkhanam āropetvā pavattā lakkhanārammanikavipassanā paññā **tīranapariññā** nāma._

R. _Kalāpasammasanato pana patthāya yāva udayabbayānupassanā tīranapariññāya bhūmi_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 241).

The nature of the arising and dissolution of the _rūpa_ and _vedanā_ is discerned by knowledge and recognized as _anicca_ (impermanance).” In this way the five-fold _upādā_- _nakkhandhā_ and _rūpa_-_nāma dhammas_ are discerned taking the three general characters such as _aniccalakkhanā_, _dukkhalakkhanā_ and _anattalakkhanā_ are taken as the object. In discerning this way the _vipassanā_ knowledge that recognizes the _aniccalakkhanā_, _dukkhalakkhanā_ and _anattalakkhanā_ as the object is **_tīranapariñña_**. R. The _rūpa_ and _nāma dhammas_ are discerned by

1. Taking _rūpa_ and _nāma_ as individual group, taking it as two individual groups, or
1. By five _khandha_ way, taking these as five individual groups, or
1. By 12 _āyatana_ way, taking these as 12 individual groups, or
1. By 18 element way, taking these as 18 individual groups.

Method meditation on the three general characters of the individuals as groups is called the method of _kalāpasammasana_. From that _kalāpasammasana_ _ñāna_ to the attain- ment of _rūpa_-_nāma_-cause-result = arising and perishing away of the _sankhāra dhammas_ are concentrated until _paccuppanakhanan_ (momentary present) is acquired. The knowledge of mediatation on the three general characters is the _udayabbayānupassanā ñāna_. This is the common abode of the **_tīranapariññā_** (_Visuddhi_-2: 241).

**The Three _Lokuttara Pariññā_**

_Yassamā vā ñātatīranapariññāyopi tadatthāyeva_, _yassamā ca ye dhamme pajahati_, _te niyamato ñāta ceva tīritā ca honti_, _tassmā pariññattayampi iminā pariyāyena magga- ñānassa kiccanti veditabbam_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 335).

_Tassā bhañgānupassanato patthāya yāva bhūmi_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 335). The _pahānapariññā_ is the field ranging from _bhañgānupassanā ñāna_ to _ariyamagga ñāna_.

_Nippariyāyena pahānapariññā nāma maggañānanti_ “_yāva maggañānā bhūmī_”_ti vattam_ (_Mahātī_.-2: 508). Definitely the _pahānapariññā_ is the _ariyamagga ñāna_. That is the reason why _atthakathā sayātaw_ has expounded the field up to the _vipassanā_ to be that of the _pahānapariññā_.

Therefore, if stated in another way, the _ñātapariññā_ and _tīranapariññā_ are for the _pahāna pariññā_ as a result. _Ñātapariññā_ and _tīranapariññā_ are arising for the _ariya- magga ñāna_ as a result. The _kilesā_ clinging on to the five-fold _khandhā nāma_-_rūpa_ _dhamma_ are completely eradicated by _ariyamagga dhamma_ via _samuccheda_. The _ariyamagga dhamma_ has analytically understood these _dhammas_ as the law of constancy. They have been investigated and have been determined to be _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _antta_. It should be noted that all the three *pariññā*s are, taken literally, the function of the _ariyamagga ñāna_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 335).

 What the above book of doctrines means is this. The *ariyamagga dhamma*s possess the force to completely eradicate the *kilesā*s hence definitely named _pahāpariññā_. The *vipassanā ñāna*s possess the force to momentarily eradicate the *kilesā*s, and because of this the _ariyamagga dhammas_ are definitely named _pahānapariññā_ and literally named _ñātapariññā_ and _tīranapariññā_. The reason for such a name is as follow.

Because the _ariyamagga dhamma_ can eradicate the *kilesā*s completely, it gets the name **_pahāna_**. It is also named _pariññā_ as it can understand penetratively, by concen- tration on as object, and analytically, the _asankhata_ element, _element of peacefulness the nibbāna dhamma_. That is why the _ariyamagga dhamma_ is definitely the _pahānapariññā_. As the *vipassanā ñāna*s possess the force which can eradicate the *kilesā*s momentarily, they are literally named as _pahānapariññā_. Furthermore the _ariyamagga dhamma_ is definitely named as _pahānapariññā_, whereas definitely, and literally also as _ñātapariññā_ and _tīranapariññā_. It is so because of the following reasons.

The _ariyamagga dhamma_ which, of necessity, eradicates the *kilesā*s completely, and so is named **_pahāna_**.\** The *asañkhata* element and element of peacefulness, *nibbāna\* _dhamma_ which, of necessity should be understood, concentrated penetratively and analytically as the object for which it is named _pariññā_. That is why the _ariyamagga_ _dhamma_ is definitely named _pahāna pariññā_.

The _ariyamagga dhamma_ can penetratively visualize the four-fold noble truth via two *pativedha*s called the _ārammanapativedha_ and _asammohapativedha_. In these two, the _ārammanapativedha_ refers to understanding the object of concentration penetratively. _Ariyamagga dhamma_ can visualize the _nirodha saccā dhamma_, called _asañkhata_ element and the element of peacefulness, the _nibbāna dhamma_, analytically and penetratively. Because of this, the _ariyamagga dhamma_ is also named as _pariññā_. And so the _ariya- magga dhamma_ is nominated as the _pahānaparññā_.

The _ariyamagga dhamma_ can penetratively understand the four noble truth by means of the two *pativedha*s called _ārammanapativedha_ and _asammohapativedha_. Of these two, the _arammanapativedha_ refers to its power of penetrative discernment of the object of concentration. The _ariyamagga dhamma_ can penetratively visualize the _asañkhata_ element and the element of peacefulness, the _nibbāna dhamma_ as the object. In this such visualization, _moha_ and _avijjā_ which can hinder penetratively understanding the four noble truth, have been eradicated completely. From functional point of view, the knowledge of the four noble truth has been accomplished at the same time with this era- dication. The knowledge of the four noble truth following the eradication of the _moha_ and _avijjā_ is known as _asammohapativedha_.

The object, of concentration by way _asammoha pativedha_, the _vipassanā_ knowledge such as

1. The five _upādānakkhandha_ = _dukkha saccā dhamma_, existing as 11 species such as the past, the future, the present, _ijjatta_, _bahiddha_, _olārika_, _sukhuma_, _hīna_, _dūra_ and _santika_, and
1. The cause and its consequence, the causal relationship, which is the _samuppāda_ called the \*samudaya saccā dhamma\*\*\*

have been accomplished, and acquired simultaneously. Hence literally the _ariyamagga_ _dhamma_ is named as _ñātapariññā_ also.

Again, the _ariyamagga dhamma_ has eradicated completely the _moha_ = _avijjā_ which hinder the understanding of the features of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of the _dukkha saccā dhamma_ and _samudaya saccā_. At the same time the attainment of the investigative and analytical knowledge of the features of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of the _dukkha saccā dhamma_ and _samudaya saccā_ has been accomplished.

 Before acquirement of the _ariyamagga dhamma_, and during practicing on the _pubbabhāgapatipadā_ prior to _ariyamagga dhamma,_ a meditator has to make effort to acquire the two *pariñña*s -- the _ñātapriññā_ which analytically understands the features of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of the _dukkha saccā dhamma_ and _samudaya saccā dhamma_, and the _tīranapariññā_ which understands these features investigatively. These two *pariññā*s are concerned only with the attainment of ariyamagga dhammas named the _pahānapariññā_, for which it literally means the _ñāta pariññā_ and _tīrana_- _pariññā_.

If the five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_ and _rūpa-nāma dhamma_ are not understood analytically by means of the three *lokīpariññā*s and the three *lokuttarapariññā*s there will be no end to suffering of the rounds of rebirth. Only if these are understood ana- lytically will there an end to the suffering of the rounds of rebirth., as instructed by the Buddha in the above mentioned Parijānana Suttana. Remember, with a clear conscious mind, that in such an analytical understanding are also included the five *upādānakhan- dhā*s of the past and of the future.

In continuation **_Mahāvajīravipassanā ñāna_** of the _Buddhisatta_ will be described as extracted from the Second volume of Mahābuddhavañ.

**The Bodhisatta exercised on sixtythree hundred millions of** **_Mahāvajīravipassanā_**

As stated in earlier sections, the characters of the *kilesā*s such as _lobha_, _dosa_ have been eradicated by virtue of _dāna_ (charity) etc. of _kusala_ _pāramī_, the _moha kilesā_ and its associated features, which could hinder the journey to the _nibbāna_, are also eradicated. The Bodhisatta, who has accomplished all these, meditated on the _mahā_- _vajīravipassanā dhammas_ in the early morning of the full moon of Kason, the second month of the year. The way meditation exercised is given below in brief.

At an age of authority, the three periods of humans, celestial beings, _byammā_ and sentient beings residing in each of the solar system of a hundred million universes, and essence of the _dhamma_ actually existing then are discerned by the Bodhisatta. The Bodhisatta realized that, however many there are of men, celestial beings, _byammā_, in each of the universe, _avijjā_ and _sankhāra_ (the cause of the past period) as the true _paramatthasabhāva dhamma_, _viññāna_, _nāma_-_rūpa_, _salāyatana_, _phassa_ and _vedanā_ (the result of the present period), _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _kamma bhava_ (the cause of the present period) together with (the _upapatti bhava_ as) _jāti_, _jarā_ + _marana_ (the results of the future period). The Bodhisatta well understood the _paramatthasabhāva dhamma_ referred to as the12 classes of _paticca samuppāda_.

When the Bodhisatta discerned on the essence of _paramatthasabhāva dhamma_ existing in the three periods of men, celestial beings, _byammā_, and sentient beings, the essence of the 12 features of _paticca samuppāda_ such as _avijjā_, _sankhāra_, _viññāna_, _nāma_-_rūpa_, _salāyatana_, _phassa_, _vedanā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _bhava jāti_, _jarā_ + _marana_ (the objects of _vipassanā_) are well realized. The discernment was made similarly of *paramatthasabhāva dhamma*s of the three periods of men, celestial beings, _byammā_, and sentient beings in other solar systems. When discerned in this way, Bodhisatta realized the 12 features of the _paticca samuppāda_, which are to be taken as the object of concentration, similar to those of this solar system.

When the Bodhisatta concentrated on the essence of the _paramatthasabhāva_ _dhamma_ of series of _khandhā_ of men, celestial beings, _byammā_, and sentient beings in the three periods in this a hundred million universe called the age of authority, the Bhodhisatta realized the groups of _dhamma_ which are to be taken as object of _vipassanā_ concentration by virtue of His knowledge. These objects are hundreds of millions of _avijjā_, _sankhāra_, _viññāna_, _nāma_-_rūpa,_ _salāyatana_, _phassa_, _vedanā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _bhava jāti_, _jarā_ + _marana_ (when these 12 are added), the _vipassanācāra_ (objects to be concentrated) which add up to 12 hundred million in all.

To eradicate the fifteen hundred tangling factors of _kilesā_, the Bodhisatta entered the _ānāpāna_ jānic state (= entered the fourth janic state of _ānāpāna_) to sharpen the knowledge of Mahāvajira vipassana as a bush clearer would use his sharpened dagger to cut away the diffusedly growing brushes. After entering this janic state the Bodhisatta analysed each and every factor, numbering 12 hundred million in all, of the _paticca samuppāda_ taking one by one their feature of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ as the object.

Therefore of 12 hundred million factors of _paticca samuppāda_, each has three knowledge such as _aniccavipassanā nana_, _dukkhavipassanā nana_, and _anattavipas- sanā nana_, and totally there will be\*\* sixtythree hundred millions in all.

(This Mahāvijaravipassanā ñāna in brief has been describe in the opening of Uparipannātīkā anupada, page 275, and in that 3rd vol. Mahākahndhaka sāriputtamogalā- na pabbjjā, page 229, of Vinisāratthadīpanītīkā).

Every Bodhisatta, when about to attain full enlightenment, naturally analyze the _paticca_ _samuppāda dhamma_ forward and backward. Our Bodhisatta, in a similar way to the predecessors, has analyze the _paticca samuppāda_ in details. Then the whole solar system with its ten thousand *lokadhātu*s trembled.

Similar to the nature of every Buddhas = (of every Bodhisattas), the Bodhisatta, after acquiring the 36 thousand millions of _mahāvipassanā sammasana nana_ of the 12 species of _paticca samuppāda_, entered the fourth jhanic state of _ānāpāna_. (It is the act of sharpening the knowledge of _udayabbaya nana_ etc. of higher knowledge of _vipassanā nana_ at the fourth _jhanic_ state of _ānāpāna samāpatta_). After entering the fourth jhanic state of _ānāpāna_ (= after sharpening the higher _vipassanā nana_), the Bodhisatta acquired the _udayabbaya ñāna_ etc. of the higher _vipassanā_ _ñāna_ in the _dhamma_ groups of the five _khandhās_ with ease.

(It must be noted that as the Bodhisatta, after being ordained and learning the three Pitakas, has exercised on _vipassanā_ to attain _udayabbaya ñāna_, _bhañga ñāna_, _bhaya ñāna_, _ādīnava ñāna_, _nibbidā ñāna_, _muccitukamayattā ñāna_, _patisankhā ñāna_ and _sankhārūpekkhā ñāna_, and the force of knowledge in meditation by means of 36 hundred million _mahāvijaravipassanā sammasana ñāna_ as mentioned above, have been so great, the above _vipassanā nanas_ are attained without difficulty. Ref. Jīnālañkāratīkā p. 55).

This is about the Mahāvajiravipassanā ñāna in Mahābhuddavañ vol. II, pp. 334-338.

**Extracts from _Bodhikathā_**

The Bodhisatta, after conquering the _devaputtamāra_ before the sunset on the fullmoon day of Kason, in the year (of Mahāsakkarāja), 103, acquired the _pubbenivāsā- nussati abhiññāna_ in the early part of that night, _dibbacakkhuabiññāna_ at _majjhimayāma_ and _āsavakkhaya ñāna_ at _pacchimayāma_ and finally attained the Buddhahood.

Then the Buddha, sitting cross-legged on the _Aparājita_ throne at the base of the bo tree, enjoyed the mental ease of _arahattaphala_ and _vimutti_. On the early , middle and last parts of the night of a day after the full moon of Kason, the Buddha took to the heart

the following.

_Avijjāpaccayā sankhāra_, _sankhārapaccaya viññānam_. R. _Evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti_. _Avijjāyatveva asesaviraganirodhā sanhāranirdohā_, _sankhāranirodha viññānanirodho_. R. _Evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hoti_ (_Vi_.-3:1).

 Because of _avijjā_, *sankhāra*s are formed; because of _sankhāra viññāna_ is formed. R. In this way the nature of cause and result of this mass of _dukkha_, in no way associated with _sukha_, become apparent. Because of _arahattamagga_, _avijjā_ alone ceases utterly* and so does *sankhāra*. Because of cessation of *samkhāra*, *viññāna* ceases. R. In this way, nature of cessation of this mass of *dukkha*, in no way associated with *sukha*, become clear (*Vi\*.-3:1).

In this way by the process of _samsāra vatta dukkha_ referred to as **_anuloma_**, by the process of dissolution of _samsāra vatta dukkha_ referred to as the **_patiloma_,** the _paticca_ _samuppāda dhamma_ was taken to the heart by the Buddha.

After analyzing the _paticca samuppāda_ forward and backward and after taking it to the heart proclaimed the first _udānagāthā_ during the early part of the night*,* and the second _udānagāthā_ during the middle and the third _udānagāthā_ during the last part of the night. In this case Vinayamahāvaggaatthakathā explained in the following way.

_Bhagavā hi visākhapunnamāya rattiyā pathamayāme pubbenivāsam anussari_, _majjhimayāme dibbacakkhum visodhesi_, _pacchimayāme paticca samuppādam anuloma-_

_patilomam manasi katvā “idāni karuno uggamissatī”ti sabbanutam pāpuni_. _Sabbanu- tappatthisamanantarameva ca aruno uggacchi_, _tato tam divasam teneva pallañkena_

_vitināmattvā sampattāya pātipadarattiyā tīsu yāmesu evum mansi katvā imāni udānāni udānesi_ (_Vi_.-_Tha_.-3: 237).

Buddha (= the Bodhisatta) during the first part of the night of fullmoon of Kason, in the year (of Mahāsakkarāja), 103, reviewed on the series of khandhās of the previous life by means of _pubbenivāsānussati abiññāna_. In the middle part of the night clearness of _dibbacakkhu abiññāna_ was accomplished. When _paticca samuppāda_ was concen- trated forward and backward, and taken heart during the last part of the night Full Enlightenment was acquired at a “time when the dawn was about to have arrived.” After the full enlightenment was attained, the dawn has occurred. Whiling away by sitting cross-legged during, after and a day later, a day of emergence = a day after the full moon day of Kason has arrived. Then the nature of _paticca samuppāda_ was taken to heart, reviewing forward and backward, and proclaimed following _udānagāthā_.

1. _Yadā have pātubhavunti dhamma_, _ātāpino chāyato byāmanassa_.

_Athassa kañkhā vapayanti sabbā_, _yato pajānāti sahetudhammam_ (_Vi_.-3: 2).

_Ãtāpino_ = _samappadhāna_ which possesses power to streneously ardently the 1500 species of *kilesa*s. _Chāyato_ = various kinds of _samatha_ object such as _ānāpāna_ etc., and firm and strong concentration power in discerning fixedly on the general characters of _anicca,_ _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of the _sankhāra dhamma_ to attain _jhānamagga_. Or due to forceful concentration. _Bhyāmanassa_ = as all ill-deeds have been detached (condoned) in the _santāna_ of the Lord Rahantā named Visuddhibhyāmana. _Yadā_ = at that moment. _Dhammā_ = 37 speceis of *bodhipakkhiya dhamma*s. _Have_ = in fact. _Pātubhavunti_ = have arisen clearly. _Yato_ = as the 37 species of *bodhipakkhiya dhamma*s have arisen clearly. _Sahetudhammam_ = _avijjā_ etc. as the causes together with the resultant _sankhāra_ etc. such as the mass of _dukkha_ are. _Pajānāti_ = understood analytically and penetratively by means of _vipassanāpaññā_ and _maggapaññā_. _Atha_ = when _paticcadhātu samuppāda_ is clearly and definitely visualized in this way. _Assa_ = in the _santāna_ of the _rahantā_. _Sabbā_ = completely. _Kañkhā_ = because of wrong view on and ignorance of the _paticca samuppāda_, 16 species of wrong view on the _rūpa_-_nāma dhamma_ occurring in three periods. _Vapayanti_ = _viapayanti_ = perished like the snow

 melting away in the sun.

2. _Yadā have pātubhavunti dhamma_, _ātāpino jhāyato bhyāmanassa_.

_Athassa kankhā vapayanti sabbā_, _yato khayam paccayābam avedi_ (_Vi_.-3: 2).

_ātāpino_ = _samappadhāna_ which possesses power to streneously depress the 1500 species of *kilesa*s. _Chāyato_ = various kinds of _samatha_ object such as _ānāpāna_ etc., and firm and strong concentration power in visualizing fixedly on the general characters of _anicca,_ _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of the _sankhāra dhamma_ to attain _jhānamagga_. Or because of forceful concentration. _Bhyāmanassa_ = as all ill-deeds have been detached in the _santāna_ of the Lord _Rahantā_ named Visuddhibhyāmana. _Yadā_ = at that moment. _Dhammā_ = 37 speceis of *bodhipakkhiya dhamma*s. _Have_ = in fact. _Pātubhavunti_ = have arisen clearly. _Yato_ = as the 37 species of *bodhipakkhiya dhamma*s have arisen clearly. _Paccayānam_ = of the causes such* as *avijjā* etc. *Khayam* = *asañkkhata nibbāna dhamma* where (*avijjā*) have ceased. *Avedi* = has come to underastand clearly and penetratively. *Atha\* = where

those causes have been annihilated = when _asankhatadhātu_, the element of peacefulness _nibbāna dhamma_ named _paccayakkhaya_ is understood clearly. _Assa_ = in the _santāna_ of the _rahantā_. _Sabbā_ = completely. _Kañkhā_ = because of ignorance of the _asañkhatadhātu_ the element of peacefulness,* the *nibbāna dhamma*, wrong view *dhamma* groups that would have appeared in the interior. *Vapayanti* = *viapayanti\* = perished like the snow melting away in the sun.

3. _Yadā have pātubhavunti dhamma_, _ātāpino chāyato byāmanassa_. _Vidhūpayam titthati mārasenam_, _suriyova obhāsayamantalikkham_ (_Vi_.-3: 2).

_Ãtāpino_ = _samappadhāna_ which possesses power to streneously depress the 1500 species of *kilesa*s. _Chāyato_ = various kinds of _samatha_ object such as _ānāpāna_ etc., and firm and strong concentration power in visualizing fixedly on the general characters of _anicca,_ _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of the _sankhāra dhamma_ to attain _jhānamagga_. Or because of forceful concentration. . _Bhyāmanassa_ = as all ill-deeds have been detached in the _santāna_ of the Lord _Rahantā_ named Visuddhibhyāmana. _Yadā_ = at that moment. _Dhammā_ = 37 speceis of *bodhipakkhiya dhamma*s. _Have_ = in fact. _Pātubhavunti_ = have clearly arisen. (Tadā = then, at that time) _Sūriyo_ = the sun which has arisen from over the edge of Mount Yugandhora. _Antalikkham_ = the _ajatā_ plane, the sky is. _Obhāsayam_ = _Obhāsayato_ = shining with its thousand radiations and lightening (the sky) moving the darkness away. _Titthati iva_ = existing. (_So byāmano_ = the noble _rahantā_. _Tehi dham_- _mehi_ = with those 37 species of _bodhipakkhiya dhammas_). _Mārasenam_ = a force of 10 lines of māra of _kāmarāga_ are. _Vidhūpayam_ = _Vidhūpayanto_ = destroyed utterly. _Titthati_ = brilliant with knowledge like the brilliantly shining sun (_Vi_.-3: 2).

(_Mahābuddhavañ_-_Du_: 357 – 361).

Here, it must be noted that “the Buddha, during the life of a Bodhisatta and before the attainment of the Buddhahood, the _paticca samuppāda_ was analytically concentrated in a similar way.”

**Extracts from Gotamakacetiyasuttan**

The 500 monks, who have entered world of _sāsanā_ from the life of bhāmana and who were experts in horology, learnt the _pariyatti dhamma_ without difficulty. For this reason _māna_ have appeared in their _santāna_. The Buddha realized that this _māna_ is an impedement to acquirement of _arahattaphala_. So the Buddha preached **_Mūlapariyāya- suttan_** (_Ma_.-1: 1) and **_Mūlapariyāyajāta_** (_Jātaka_-_Ttha_.-2: 237) to these 500 monks so as to deplete them of their _māna_. When it was done with, the monks exercised on _vipassanā_, _samatha_ and _bhāvanā_, the _indare_ in their _santāna_ become mature, and when the maturity is so attained, the Buddha expatiated this _Gotamacetiyasuttan_ at the _Gotamakacetī_ in _Vesālī_.

_Abhiññāyāham bhikkhave dhammam desemi no anabiññāya_, _sanidānāham bhikkhave dhammam desemi no anidānam_, _sappātihāriyāham dhammam desemi no appātihāriyam_. _Tassa mahsam bhikkhave abiññāya dhammam desayato no anabiññāya sanidānam dhammam desayato no anidānam appātihāriyam dhammam desayato no appātihāriyam karanīyo ovādo karanīyā anussāsanī_, _alañca pana vo bhikkhave tutthiyā alam attamanatāya alam somanassāya_ “_sammāsambuddho bhagavā_, _savekkhāto dhammo_, _suppatipanno samgho_”_ti_ (_Am_.-1: 280).

Bhikkhave …. I preach only after understanding the _dhamma_ penetratively by means of _paccakha ñāna_. I do not preach without understanding the _dhamma_ penetra- tively by means of _paccakha ñāna_. I only preach the _dhamma_ with _nidāna_, but not the one without _nidāna_. Bhikkhave …. I only preach the _dhamma_ that possesses the force to dispel the one that is opposite, but not the one without this force. Now I have admonished this _ovāda dhamma_ once to you, and have made repeated admonishing _anusāsanī_ to you all.

Bhikkhus … you all should willing accept the fact that

\1. The Buddha is endowed with _sammāsambuddha guna_ by which the five-fold

 _ñeyadhamma_ called _sankhāra_, _vikāra_, _lakkhana_, _nibbāna_ and _paññatta_ are understood by _sayambhūñān_._a_, a kno.wledge acquired by himself, without the assitance. of anyone, and which .has the ability to visualize penetratively.

1. The Buddha is endowed with _savekkhāta gu_._na_ by which the 10-fold _dhamma_ as _Maggaphala_, _Nibbāna_, _Dhammakkhan_ are admonished, from beginning

through middle to the end, apprehensively.

2. The eight noble disciples are endowed with _suppa_._tipanna gun_. _a_ by which the _niyānika dhamma_ are obediently exercised so as to escape from the _samsāra_-

 _vatta_.

The Buddha has preached that it should be willingly accepted, should have mind to accept heartily, and should have clear _somanassa_ to happily accept (_Am_.-1: 280).

_Imassamim ca pana veyākaranassamim bhaññāmāne sahassī lokadhātu akampitta_

(_Am_.-1: 280).\*

As this **_Gotamakacetiyasuttan_** _desana_ was delivered in simple language, but not in _gāthā_, the earth in a thousand _lokadhātu_ trembled violently (_Am_.-1: 280).

_Idañca suttam sutvā pañcasatā bhikkhu tassamamyevāsane saha patisambhidāhi arahattam pāpunamsu_ (_Ma_.-_Tha_.-1: 61)

 After listening to this _gotamacetiyasuttan_, the 500 monks attained the _arahattaphala_ together with the four-fold _patisambhidā ñāna_ there and then.

This is the _suttana_ for which even the non-living earth, situated in a thousand _dhātu_, stands in support of its truth. If you, as a living _saviññānaka_ complete with clever mind and knowledge, can stand in support of the truth as does the earth, then you have approached the main path of _magga_ leading to _nibbāna_.

Here, in this explanation emphasis is put on the process of _sankhāra loka_ called _lokasamudaya_ = _anulomapaccayākāra_ = _anulomapaticca samuppāda dhamma_ and the process of cessation of _sankhāra loka_ = _patilomapaccayākāra_ = _patilomapaticca samuppāda dhamma_. The Buddha, as a Bodhitassa during the night when about to acquire the Buddhahood, meditated on the nature of _paticca samuppāda_ via _vipassanā ñāna_ called _paccakkha ñāna_ by way of _anulomapatiloma_ (_Vi_.-_Ttha_.-3: 237). After attaining the Buddhahood too* the nature of *paticca samuppāda* was meditated and analyzed forward and backward by *anulomapatiloma*. With regard to this the Buddha has noted in the *Buddhavañ\* this way.

[Here it should be noticed that in knowledge of the Buddha, although all the *dhammas* have been visualized in all possible features (even as a Bodhisatta on the night when the Buddhahood was to have attained), and when the exercise was primarily on the *paticca samuppāda*, *vipassanā* was taken to the heart. And that the *dhamma* of *paticca* *samuppāda* was deep, subtle and heard to visualize. Therefore, only the process of the arising and dissolution of *paticca samuppāda* was discerned to be the the process of *sansārvatta dukkha*.] (_Mahābuddhavañ_, Vol 2: 356).

Only after visualizing penetratively by himself, the Buddha admonished the _sansāravatta dukkha_ = process of arising and of perishing away of _sankhāraloka_ referred to as _anulomapatiloma paticca samuppāda dhamma_ to his disciples. That the disciples could understand as instructed has been expatiated by the Buddha in the *suttan*s of which the second _ariyasāvakasuttan_ is given.

**The Second _Ariyasāvakasuttana_**

_Na bhikkhave sutavato ariyasāvakassa evum hoti_ “_kim nu kho – kissamam sati kim hoti_, _Kissuppādā kim uppjjati_, _kissamam sati sankhārā honti_, _kissamam sati viññānam_ _hoti_, _kissamam sati nāma-rūpam hoti_, _kissamam sati salāyatanam hoti_, _kissamam sati phasso hoti_, _kissamam sati vedanā hoti_, _kissamam sati tahnā hoti_, _kissamam sati upādānam hoti_, _kissamam sati bhavo hoti_, _kissamam sati jāti hoti_, _kissamam sati jarāmaranam hotī”ti_.

**\*Na parappaaccayanā**ti parassa asaddahanena* (*Sam*.-*Tī\*.-2: 38).

Bhikkhus …. There are two kinds of knowledge: one acquired after being taught called _āgamsuta_ and the other self-acquired through practice, called _adhigamsuta_. In the _santāna_ of my noble _sāvaka_ who is endowed with these two, there will not arise, in his mind, such thought as “How? Which _dhamma_ would arise when a certain _dhamma_ is in existence clearly? Which is the _dhamma_ due to the existence of which there would arise a _dhamma_?

What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the *sankhāra*s ? What are the _dhammas_ that would cause arising of _viññāna_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _nāma-rūpa_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _salāyatana_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _phassa_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _vedanā_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _tahnā_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _upādāna_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _bhava_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _jāti_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _jarāmarana_?

No such a thought ever comes across his mind. Bhikkhus …. In fact, in the _santāna_ of my noble disciple who is possessed of the two kinds of knowledge, one acquired after being taught called _āgamsuta_ and the other self-acquired through practice, called _adhigamsuta_, there would arise only the penetratively visualizing **_aparappaccaya ñāna_** = **_attapaccakkha ñāna_**. This knowledge enables the _sāvaka_ to understand the cause-result relationship = _anulomapaticca samuppāda dhamma_ penetratively by his own self, with respect in this case to the fact that there is no one but self to rely upon.

If this cause is really in existence, there will be a clear result. It is because of this cause that the resultant has arisen. – If there is _avijja_ as a cause, there will be _sankhāra_ as a resultant. If there is _sankhāra_ as a cause, there will be _viññāna_ as a resultant. If there is _viññāna_ as a cause, there will be _nāma-rūpa_ as a resultant. If there is _nāma-rūpa_ as a cause, there will be _salāyatana_ as a resultant. If there is _salāyatana_ as a cause, there will be _phassa_ as a resultant.* If there is *phassa* as a cause, there will be *vedanā* as a resultant. If there is *vedanā* as a cause, there will be *tahnā* as a resultant. If there is *tahnā* as a cause, there will be *upādāna* as a resultant. If there is *upādānaa* as a cause, there will be *bhava* as a resultant. If there is *bhava* as a cause, there will be *jāti* as a resultant. If there is *jāti* as a cause, there will be *jarā* + *marana\* as a resultant.

This is the only kind of knowledge the _sāvaka_ will have. That noble _sāvaka_ of mine would come to differentially know as “This is way the _sankhāra loka_ arises” by means of **_aparappaccaya ñāna_** = **_attapaccakkha ñāna_**.

Bhikkhus …. In the _santāna_ of my noble disciple who is endowed with two kinds of knowledge, the _āgamsuta_ and _adhigamsuta_, not a single thought ever comes across his mind – “How come? ? Which _dhamma_ would not arise when a certain _dhamma_ is not in existence clearly? The cessation (by way of _anuppādanirodha_) which _dhamma_ would cause the dissolution of corresponding resultant _dhamma_? –

Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the *sankhāra*s would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _viññāna_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _nāma-rūpa_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _salāyatana_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _phassa_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _vedanā_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _tahnā_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _upādāna_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _bhava_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _jāti_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _jarā_ + _marana_ would not arise?

This kind of thought never crosses his mind. In fact, in the _santāna_ of my noble disciple who is possessed of the two kinds of knowledge, one acquired after being taught called _āgamsuta_ and the other self-acquired through practice, called _adhigamsuta_, there would arise only the penetratively visualizing **_aparappaccaya ñāna_** = **_attapaccakkha ñāna_**. This knowledge enables the _sāvaka_ to understand the the cessation of the cause- result relationship = _patilomapaticca samuppāda dhamma_ penetratively by his own self, with respect in this case to the fact that there is no one but only self to rely upon.

If this cause has not been clearly in existence, there could not be a resultant _dhamma_; due to cessation (by _anuppādanirodha dhamma_) of this cause, the result ceases (by _anuppādanirodha dhamma_).

If there is no _avijjā_ as a cause, there will be no _sankhāra_ as a result. If there is no _sankhāra_ as a cause, there will be no _viññāna_ as a result. If there is no _viññāna_ as a cause, there will be no _nāma-rūpa_ as a result. If there is no _nāma-rūpa_ as a cause, there will be no _salāyatana_ as a result. If there is no s*alāyatana* as a cause, there will be no _phassa_ as a result. If there is no _phassa_ as a cause, there will be no _vedanā_ as a result. If there is no _vedanā_ as a cause, there will be no _tahnā_ as a result. If there is no _tahnā_ as a cause, there will be no _upādāna_ as a result. If there is no _aupādāna_ as a cause, there will be no _bhava_ as a result. If there is no _bhava_ as a cause, there will be no _jāti_ as a result. If there is no _jāti_ as a cause, there will be no _jarā_ + _marana_ as a result.

This is the only knowledge the _sāvaka_ has in mind. That noble _sāvaka_ of mine would come to differentially know as “This is way the _sankhāra loka_ ceases (by way of _anuppādanirodha dhamma_)” by means of **_aparappaccaya ñāna_** = **_attapaccakkha ñāna_**.

Bhikkhus …. Then, in this way my noble _sāvaka_ understands differentially as “this is the way of arising and and of cessation of the _sankhāra loka_” via **_aparappaccaya ñāna_** = **_attapaccakkha ñāna_**. Bhikkhus …. At that time my noble _sāvaka_ unerringly understands, via **_aparappaccaya ñāna_** = **_attapaccakkha ñāna_**, the true nature of the arising and cessation of the _sankhāra loka_. Bhikkhus …. Then this noble _sāvaka_ of mine is recognized as one endowed with **_sammāditthi_**, with right _dassana ñāna_, who has attained the _dhamma_ of good deeds called _saddhama_, who has acquired the vision of the _dhamma_ of good deeds called _saddhama_, who is endowed with still practicing _sakkha ñāna_ vision, who is endowed with still practicing _vijjā ñāna_, one who has attained the _dhamma_ called _dhammasota_, one endowed with _nibbedhikapaññā_ (called _vipassanpaññā_ _maggapaññā_) which is clean and superior and which can annihilate the mass of _kilesa_, and one who is at the door of _nibbāna_ (_Sam_.-1: 306-308).

As the _nāma_-_rūpapariccheda ñāna_ to _sammāditthi_ are admonished by the Buddha himself, the _lokiyavipassanāsammāditthi_ and _lokuttaramaggasammāditthi_ are together expatiated as the _sammāditthi_ (_Sam_.-_Ttha_.-2: 32; _Sam_.-_Tī_.-2: 38).

Therefore, in this Suttana from aspect of _sakkha_ — **\*sakkho**ti puthujjanakalayāna-\*

_kena saddham satta ariyā tisso sikkhā sikkhanti sikkhā_ (_Abhi_.-_Ttha_.-2: 315).— In accor- dance with the opening of this _kalayānaputhujjana_ and the seven lower _ariyā_ individuals should be called _sakkha_ individuals who are still practicing the three features of _sikkhā_ called _sīla_, _samādhi_ and _paññā_. Because of this, it should be noted, _kalayānaputhujana_ individual, endowed with _vipassanāsammāditthi ñāna_ vision, is also included among the _sikkha_ individuals.

 In this _suttana_ the Buddha himself has stated that the _kalayānaputhujjana_ toge- ther with _sikkhāariyā_ indivuals penetratively understand, by means of **_aparappaccaya ñāna_** = **_attapaccakkha ñāna_**, the process of arising of the _sankhāraloka_, called _lokasamudaya_, and of cessation of _sankhāraloka_, called _lokanirodha_. Similarly the disciples have admitted to each other, during discussion on the _lokasamudaya_ and _lokanirodha_, that they understand these processes penetratively. These are mentioned in the _pitakas_ clearly. Now some extracts from _kosambisuttan_ will be presented.

**Extracts from _Kosambisuttan_**

Once the venerable Musila, Pavittha, Nārada, Ãnandā were whiling at the _Ghositā_ monastry in the country of _Kosambi_. Then the venerable Pavittha put some questions to the venerable Musila. The venerable Musila duely answered the questions. The questions and answers are as follows.

_Aññattareva āvuso pavittha saddhāya aññattara ruciyā aññattara anussavā aññattara ākāraparivitakkā aññattara ditthinijjhānakhantiyā atthāyassamato musilassa paccattameva ñānam_ “_jātipaccayā jarāmaranan_”_ti_.

_Aññattareva āvuso musila saddhāya aññattara ruciyā aññattara anussavā aññattara ākāraparivitakkā aññattara ditthinijjhānakhantiyā ahametam jānām ahametam passāmi_ “_jātipaccayā jarāmaranan_”_ti_ (_Sam_.-1.: 336).

_Thero pana pañcapi etāni kāranāni patikkhapitvā paccakkhañānena patividdhbhāvum pucchanto **aññattareva āvuso musila saddhāyā**tiādomāha_ (_Sam.-Ttha_.-2: 113).

**Question** — My Lord Musila ….

1. _Saddhā_ = belief in others,
1. _Ruci_ = One’s own confidence born out of self thinking,
1. _Anussava_ = reasonable knowledge obtained from others,
1. _Ãkāparivitakka_ = careful considerable on the characters,
1. _Ditthinijjhānakkhanti_ = devotion towards the tought acquired just by thinking.

Is there **_paccakkhaññāna_** that understands the fact that because of _jāti_ as the cause, except the above five, _jarāmarana_ arises?

**Answer** — My Lord Pavittha ….

1. _Saddhā_ = belief in others,
1. _Ruci_ = One’s own confidence born out of self thinking,
1. _Anussava_ = reasonable knowledge obtained from others,
1. _Ãkāparivitakka_ = careful considerable on the characters,
1. _Ditthinijjhānakkhanti_ = devotion towards the tought acquired just by thinking.

Yes I know there is **_paccakkhaññāna_** that understands the fact that because of _jāti_ as the cause, except the above five, _jarāmarana_ arises (_Sam_.-1: 336-337).

Upto arising of _sankhāra_ _dhammas_ due to _avijjā_ were asked similarly, and the answers were made similarly. Again the process of cessation of _sankhāra dhamma_ was asked.

_Aññattareva āvusso musila saddhāya aññattara ruciyā aññattara anussavā aññattara ākāraparivitakkā aññattara ditthinijjhānakkhantiyā atthāyassamato musilassa paccattameva ñānam_ “_jātinirodhā jarāmarananirodho_”_ti_. _Ãññattareva āvusso pavittha saddhāya aññattara ruciyā aññattara anussavā aññattara ākāraparivitakkā aññattara ditthinijjhānakkhantiyā ahametam jānāmi ahametam passāmi_ “_jātinirodhā jarāmarananirodho_”_ti_ (_Sam_.1: 337).

Question — My Lord Musila ….

1. _Saddhā_ = belief in others,
1. _Ruci_ = One’s own confidence born out of self thinking,
1. _Anussava_ = reasonable knowledge obtained from others,
1. _Ãkāparivitakka_ = careful considerable on the characters,
1. _Ditthinijjhānakkhanti_ = devotion towards the tought acquired just by thinking

Is there **_paccakkhaññāna_** that understands the fact that because the _jāti_ ceases (by way of _anuppādanirodha dhamma_), with the exception of the above five, _jarāmarana_ ceases (by way of _anuppādanirodha dhamma_)?

**Answer** — My Lord Pavittha ….

1. _Saddhā_ = belief in others,
1. _Ruci_ = One’s own confidence born out of self thinking,
1. _Anussava_ = reasonable knowledge obtained from others,
1. _Ãkāparivitakka_ = careful considerable on the characters,
1. _Ditthinijjhānakkhanti_ = devotion towards the tought acquired just by thinking.

Yes I know that there is **_paccakkhaññāna_** that understands the fact that because the _jāti_ ceases (by way of _anuppādanirodha dhamma_), with exception of the above five, _jarāmarana_ ceases (by way of _anuppādanirodha dhamma_). (_Sam_.1: 337).

Up to cessation of _avijjā_ and of _sankhāra_ _dhammas_ were asked similarly, and the answers were made similarly. Here explanations contained in the _atthakathā tīkā_ will be presented in continuation.

1. **_Saddhā_** – some people believe in what others said, and would repeat what he has

heard. He takes it as the truth. The he is the one who is dependent upon others, his knowledge is that of other’s, and, in a way, he ends up at other’s mouth. He is the kind of person without analyzing capability.

2. **_Ruci_** – the other kind of person is the one who thinks about something by himself.

He would think to his liking as “this will arise by itself, not due to other factors.” He would not rely on others with regard to this and would take it to his heart’s liking and as the truth.

3. **_Anussava_** – still the other kind of person would ask “How does this factor arise?

Why does this arise? This factor arises in this way; this factor arises because of this cause.—He would have heard it this way from predecessors. It has been heard so since a long time ago. This is the truth. This factor is just the right one”. What he has heard from others is taken to be true. He is another kind of person who ends up at other’s mouth.

4. **_Ãkāraparivitakka_** – while thinking as this factor may have arisen this way, a factor

he has thought appear in his citta for every material. He is the fourth kind of person who would take into his mind as if what he has thought really exists and is the truth. This is the person without practical experience, who has come to a dead end by just thinking.

5. **_Ditthinicchānakkhanti_** – a fifth kind of person is the one who is considering on a

causative factor, and a certain result occurs while doing so. He firmly believes in it, and takes to heart of the fact that there is no other result. In such a person a kind of firm and determined belief, called _abhinivesa_, occurs. In his thought, concentrated on this cause, a kind of contendment and satisfaction appears. This person will willingly accept – “This cause really exists”, just by thought. This is the\*\* _Ditthinicchānakkhanti_ (_Sam_.-_Ttha_.-2:122; _Sam_.-_Tī_.-2: 122).

It has been asked if the process of arising of _sankhāraloka_ called _lokasamudaya_ = _anulomapaticcasamuppāda dhamma_ and of the dissolution of _sankhāraloka_ called the _lokanirodha_ = _anulomapaticcasamuppāda dhamma_ are understood and visualized by means of _paccakkha ñāna_, after eradicating the the five causes such as _saddhā_, _ruci_, _anussava_, _ākāparivitakka_ and _ditthinicchānakkhanti_.

The reply was that the process of the arising and dissolution of the _sankhāraloka_ has been understood and visualized by the _paccakkha ñāna_ only, but not with these five causes. In accordance with the _desanā_ – _purimakammabhavassamim moho avijjā_ – admonished in the 12 characters of _paticca samuppāda_, page (50) of Patisambhidāmagga pāli in which the Venerable Musila has admittedly stated to have understood and visualized by means of **_paccakkha ñāna_**, the three periods are included as

1. _Dhamma_ groups of the past period referred to as _avijjā_, _sankhāra_,
1. The present period extending from _viññā_ to (_kamma_) _bhava_,
1. _Dhamma_ groups of the future period referred to as _jāti_, _jarāmarana_.

Because of the inclusion of these three periods, you may called these characters of the _paticca samuppāda_ also as the _dhammas_ of past, future and present periods; or in accordance with the _desanā_ mentioned in Patisambhidāmagga pāli, on page (52) as – _jāta avijjā paccuppanna_ – all can be regarded as solely _paccuppanna dhamma_. Whichever way it is regarded –

1. In _vipassanā_ prior to _ariyamagga_ called _pubbabhāgasatipatthānamagga_,
1. At the moment of _ariyamagga_,

A meditator must try to visualize these 12 characters of _paticca samuppāda_ by the knowledge of _paccakkha ñāna_ variously admonished as _anubodhañāna_, _pativedhañāna_, _ñātapariññā_, _tīranapariññā_, _pahānapariññā_, _vipassanāsammāditthi_, _maggasammāditthi_, _aparapaccayañāna_, _attapaccakkhañāna_, etc. As a man would see different _rūpa_ objects via his physical eyes, so should a meditator make attempt at understanding and visualizing these 12 characters penetratively. The Buddha has admonished that only understanding and visualizing this way can one acquire _ariyamagga_ where all _asāva dhammas_ have been utterly eradicated (Sam.-1: 267). Only after penetratively understanding this way, should one discern on the past and future, which are _adittha_, in the same way.

**Be Considerate and Ponder**

_Yam kiñci rāhula rūpam atītānāgatapaccuppanam ijjhattam vā bahiddhā vā olārikam vā sukhumam vā hīnam vā panītam vā yam dūre vā santike vā_, _sabbam rūpam_ “_netam mama_, _nesohamassami_, _na meso attā_”_ti evummetam yathābhūtam sammappaññāya passati_ (_Sam_.-1: 444; _Anusayasutta_).

**\*Sammappaññāya passatī**ti saha vipassanāya maggapaññāya sutthu passati* (*Sam*.-*Ttha\*.- 2: 197).

In this Suttana the Buddha has instructed Rahulā to discern the five-fold _upādā_- _nakkhandhā_, existing as 11 species situated within the past, future and present periods, and in the two _santāna_ of _ijjhatta_ and _bahiddha_ – “_netam mama_, _nesohamassami_, _na meso attā_” = as _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ unerringly by virtue of **_sammappaññā_**. Discern with **_sammappaññā_**, as explained in the _atthakathā_, means to discern by _vipassanā paññā_ together with _ariyamagga paññā_ so as to visualize thoroughly.

With reference to this explanation note that the **_sammappaññā_ = good and true knowledge** means the _vipassanā paññā_ and _ariyamagga paññā_. Discern with _vipassanā paññā_, and also with the _ariyamagga paññā_ on the five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_ of the past, future and present periods as _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_. In this discerning are the _vipassanā paññā_ and _ariyamagga paññā_ the _anvaya ñāna_ or _paccakkha ñāna_? The _sayādaw_ has explained in the book of meaning as follows.

**_Samma_**. **R**. **\*Passatī**ti\* _pubbabhāge vipassanāñānena sammasanavasena_, _mag-gakkhane abhisamayavasena sutthu attapaccakkhkena passat_ (_Sam_.-_Tī_.-2: 181).

In _vipassanā_ prior to _ariyamagga_ the past and future five-fold *upādānakkhandhā*s are well discerned by **_attapaccakkha ñāna_**, called the _sammāditthi ñāna_, which arose by the power of knowledge acquired through the discernment of these five-fold _khandhās_ as the object. During the _ariyamagga_ stage, the past and future five-fold *upādānak- khandhā*s are well discerned by **_attapaccakkha ñāna_,** called the _sammāditthi ñāna_, which arose by the power of knowledge acquired through concentrating on these five-fold *khandhā*s via _asamohapativedha_ that annihilates the _moha_ hindering the understanding of these *khandhā*s.

The _vipassanāditthi ñāna_, which can discern on the past and future five-fold _upā-_

*dānakkhadhā*s taking them as the object of concentration, is called **_attapaccakkha ñāna_**. In the same way _maggasammāditthi ñāna_ has also been given as **_attapaccakkha ñāna_.** This explanation was given the Reverend Dhammapāva known by the name of Ãcariya Dhammapāla.

_Atha kho rūpāni viya cakkhuviññānena rūpādīni tesam ca samudayādike paccakkha katvā dassanam …_ (_Sam_.-_Tī_.-2: 63).

**\*Avijjāsamudayā**ti avijjāya uppādā*, *atthibhāvāti attho*. *Nirodhavirodhī hi atthibhāvo hoti*, *tassamā nirodhe asati atthibhāvo hoti*, *tassamā purimabhavasiddhāya avijjāya sati imassamim bhave rūpassa samudayo rūpassa uppādo hotīti attho\*. **\*Tahnāsamudayo kammasamudayo**ti itthāpi eseva nayo* (*Sam*.-*Tī\*.-2: 58).

**\*Avijjānirodhā rūpanirodho**ti aggamaggañānena avijjāya anuppādanirodhato anāgatassa rūpassa anuppādanirodho hoti paccayābhāve abhāvato* (*Sam*.-*Tī*.-2: 59; *Mahātī\*.-2: 421).

It was also the Reverend Dhammapāva known by the name of Ãcariya Dhammapāla who has explained that as a man could see the _rūpa_ objects by _cakkhuviñ- ñāna_, so should the following be seen penetratively by a meditator see the nature of the _samudaya_ and _nirodha_ = (_attanñgama_) —

1. The five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_ existing in 11 features as the past, future, present, _ijjhatta_, _bahiddha_, _olārika_, _sukhuma_, _hīna_, _panīta_, _dūra_, _santika_,
2. (a) The nature of the _samudaya_ of the present five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_ of five- fold _patisandhekhandhā_ etc. due to arising of the causes such as _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_, _kamma_ etc. of the past _bhava_, which had been cultivated during the establishment of the _kammabhava_; (b) the nature of the _samudaya_ of the future five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_ of five-fold _patisandhekhandhā_ etc. due to arising of the causes such as _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_, _kamma_ etc. of the present _bhava_, which had been cultivated during the establishment of the _kammabhava_, (c) the nature of the _samudaya_, referred to as _nibbattilakkhanā_, of initial arising of these *upādānakkhandhā*s
3. (a) Cessation, without reappearance once again, due to _arahatta magga_ of causes such as _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _kamma_ etc. called the nature of _anupādanirodha_ because of which when *upādānakkhandhā*s, the future results, pass away by non- reappearble cessation, referred to as cessation by nature of _anupādanirodha_ = the nature of _nirodha_ = _atthañgama_, (c) the perishing of these *upādānakkhandha*s called _bhañga_ = the nature of _nirodha_ and _atthañgama_.

_Naydassanavasena vā evum vuttam_. _Patthamahñi paccuppannadhammānam udayabbayam disvā atha atītānāgate nayam neti_ (_Mahā_.-_Tī_,-2: 423).

In other words, it is explained as the _nayadassana_ = by virtue of demonstrating the method. To begin with, of the _paccuppanna dhamma_,

 1 (a) The nature of the _samudaya_ of the present five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_ of five- fold _patisandhekhandhā_ etc. due to arising of the causes such as _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_, _kamma_ etc. of the past _bhava_, which had been cultivated during the establishment of the _kammabhava_; (b) the nature of the _udaya_ of the future five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_ of five-fold _patisandhekhandhā_ etc. due to arising of the causes such as _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_, _kamma_ etc. of the present _bhava_, which had been cultivated during the establishment of the _kammabhava_, (c) because of cessation of the causes such as _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_, _kamma_ by means of _anuppādha_ due to the _ariyamagga_, the future results like _upādānakkhandhās_ they pass away by the nature of _anuppādanirodha_. This nature of this passing away, called the nature of vaya, can be visualized by **_paccayato udayabbayadassana_**;

\2. The **_khanato udayabbayadassana_** which can discern the momentary arising and

perishing away of (the causes) the resultant *upādānakkhandhā*s;

 It has been instructed by the very Mahātīkā Sayādaw the Venerable Dhammapāla that only after discerning on these two kinds of _udayabbaya_ by the _paccakkha ñāna_ concentrate on those of the past and future, which are _adittha_, in a similar way.

It must be remembered that the teacher of the book of meaning never has indicated to discern on the past and future factors not via _paccakkhna ñāna_ but by speculation. And those in search of eternal peace, the _nibbāna_, should always keep that in mind.

**The Noblest Speech**

_Yam Buddho bhāsate vācam_, _khemam nibbānapattiyā_. _Dukkhassantakariyāya_, _sā ve vācānamuttamā_ (_Sam_.-1: 191).

_Buddho_ = the Buddha who has understood the Four Noble Truth penetratively, without help of teachers, but by his own knowledge called _sayambhū ñāna_, and so named because he has made the celestial beings, the worldling, the byahmā and all the sentient beings to penetratively understand the Four Noble Truth via the _paccaknakha ñāna_. _Nibbānapattiyā_ = to take the great _asankhata_ element, the element of peacefulness, the _nibbāna dhamma_, which would bring an end to the suffering of the worldly affairs, as the object and concentrate by means of _paccakkha ñāna_. _Dukkhassa_ = _vattadukkha_ in the three lives and three planes belonging to three stages of being (e.g. _kāma_, _rūpa_, _arūpa_ existences). _Antakiriyāya_ = for attaining the ending by cessation of _dukkha_ via passing away of the corporeality. _Khemam_ = that which is the attainment of peace and end of the multitude of sufferings. _Yam vācam_ = that _dhamma_ talk, which should be taken as good _niyānika dhamma_, that helps one escape from _samsarāvatta_. _Bhāsate_ = has admonished with _karunā_ and _mettā_. _Sā vācā_ = that _dhamma_ talk which is the _niyānika dhamma_ that lead one to escape from the _samsarāvatta_ is. _Vācānam_ = of all the talks. _Uttamā_ = the most superior and noblest of all (_Sam_.-1: 191; _Sam_.-_Ttha_.-2: 252).

These descriptions will suffice to conclude the treatment on **_Paccakkha ñāna_** **and** **_Anvaya ñāna_**. If the explanations given here is acccepted without reservation, then you the noble man is expected to also accept the explanations on Baddekarattasuttana.

**_Bhaddekaratta_ (An Auspicious Night) _Suttana_ – Explanation**

In **_Uparipan_**..**_n_** **_āsapāli vibhañga_**, included in _Mijjhimanikāya_ of the five sections of _nikāya_, four *suttana*s come under the name of **_bhaddekaratta_** = **an auspicious night**. The first _bhaddekaratta suttana_ is _sammāsambuddhabhāsita suttana_ admonished by the Buddha, the _sabbaññu sammāsammābuddha_ himself.

The second _suttana_ is one admonished by the Venerable Ãnandā himself. The third _suttana_ was admonished by the Venerable Mahāpaccé.

The fourth was _sammāsammābuddhabhāsita suttana_ which came into being in relation to the Venerable Lomasakañgiya.

The meaning of \*bhaddekaratta**\* has been** given as **_baddekaratta_** = **an auspicious night**, the explanation being given with reference of method of the five-fold *khandha*s in the first, second and fourth *suttana*s. In the third _suttana_ it was given with reference to the method of 12 species _āyatana_.

In these *suttana*s the monks, who are exercising the _vipassanābhāvanākammat_- _thāna_ day and night on the five-fold _khandhā_ and causes within the two *santāna*s referred to as _ijjhatta_ and _bahiddha_, the three periods the past, future and present or the 12 species of _āyatana_, are expatiated to be **monks of an auspicious night**, and the **night to be of an auspicious night**. The meditation was made to attain _khanapaccuppanna_ by means of

_aniccānupassanā_ etc. of the seven species of _nupassanā_.

If you, as a meditator, also wanted to be **a meditating individual of an auspi- cious** **night,** you must** exercise** the _vipassanābhāvanākammatthāna_ on the causes of the three periods and within two *santāna*s together with the five-fold _khandhā_ by means of the _aniccānupassanā_ etc. of the seven species of _nupassanā_. In this doctrine, explanations will be made as to how to become a monk of **an auspicious night**, orientating towards understanding the five-fold _khandhā_ = 12 species of _āyatana_ = _rūpa_- _nāma dhamma_ penetratively understood by three _pariññā_. To acquire this penetrative knowledge, a step by step elucidation will be made of the exercise on \*vipassanā bhāvanā**_ from _**ānāpāna* way\*\* to the attainment of *arahattaphala\*.

Among the _Baddekaratta suttanas_, four *gāthā*s are given in brief, and their meanings are g1iv. e n\* *A*in*t* *ī*c*t*._a_ o*m*n..t* i*n*n*ā*.u *n*a*v*ti*ā*o*g*n*a*.. *m* T*e*.h *y*e*a* ,f o*n*. u*a*r*p\* *pgaāttihkāa*s*ñ* a*k*r*h*e*e\*\* a*a*s*n* f*ā*o*g*l.l*a*o *t*.w*a* .*m\* .. .

-   . . .

4. _Evum vihāram ātāpam_, _ahorattamatanditam_.

_Tam ve_ “_baddekaratto_”_ti_, _santo ācakkhate muni_.

The meaning of the above *gāthā*s are as follows.

 1 (a). As the past five-fold _khandhā_ have perished utterly, the past five-fold *khandhā*s

(= the 12 _āyatana_) should not be clung to by _tahnā_-_ditthi_ as “I, mine”.

(b) As the future five-fold *khandhā*s have not yet attained, and so have not arisen, the future five-fold *khandhā*s should not be anticipated by _tahnā_-_ditthi_ as “I, mine”.

2. The man of wisdom should discern on the present five-fold *khandhā*s

1) at that moment of arising
1) at that _dhamma_ groups
1) at site of forest etc., by means of _aniccānupassanā_ etc. of the seven kinds of _nupassanā_. The man of wisdom should be recollecting on the indestructible _vipassanā ñāna_ to which no _tahnā_-_ditthi_ attached as “I, mine”. In other words to enter a _janic_ state of _asankhata dhātu_, element of peacefulness, the _nibbāna_ and _phalasammāpatta_ by the recollecting on these which have not been destroyed and

 with no attached _tahnā_-_ditthi_ as “I, mine”.

3. For the purpose exercise by the recollecting _vipassanā ñāna_ or for exercise by recollection on the _phalasamāpatta_, which is associated with _samattha vipassanā_ that is able to annihilate *kilesā*s, effort must be made without procrastination. For no body knows if one would be still alive tomorrow or a day after. Indeed we never have any

agreement with the king of death regarding when to die.

4. The monk, who leads his life making every effort to acquire _phalasamāpatta_, that is associated with _samattha vipassanā_ that is can annihilate the *kilesā*s, is, in fact, **one who belongs to an auspicious night**. This was expatiated by the _Sabbaññu Sammāsambuddha Buddha_ named _Buddhamuni_ the Supreme of the *muni*s in

 whom the *kilesā*s have utterly been eradicated (_Ma_.-3: 226).

Bhikkhus …. How is the past enjoyed?

1. Delight in the past _rūpa dhamma_, the _nandī dhamma_, as **–** “The _rūpa_ _dhamma_ has arisen in the past” **–** has appeared.
1. “Such a feeling = _vedanā dhamma_ in the past,
1. Such an awareness = _saññā dhamma_,
1. Such a dynamic groups of _cetasika sankhāra dhammas_,
1. Such a mental quality = _viññāna dhamma_ has arisen.” will cause the formation of delight in the past (_vedanā_-_saññā_-_sankhāra_) _viññāna dhammas_. Bhikkhus …. The

 past is enjoyed in this way (_Ma_. 3: 226).

If the delight, _nandī dhammas_,* in the *rūpa*-*vedanā*-*saññā*-*sankhāra*-*viññāna\* of the past resulted as expounded above by the Buddha, then there always is enjoyment in the past. This is what it really means and which must be well noted. Again the Venenrable Mahākaccé also has explained how to have enjoyment in the past as given below. .

_Kathañca āvuso atītam_. _anvāga_._m_ _eti? Iti me ca_. _kkhu ahosi atītamaddhānam_, _iti rūpāti_, _tattha sandarāgappatibaddham hoti viññānam_, _sandarāgappatibaddhattā viññānassa_

**.**

_tadabhisandati_, _tadabhinadanto atītam anvāgameti_ (_Ma_.-3: 236).

My colleagues …. In what ways is the past always enjoyed?

The _nikanti viññāna_ associated with longing for element of eye clearness and in material object, the _chandharāga_, had arisen such as in the past I have had element of eye clearness in this way, my material objects have been this way. Because of association of this conscious (_nikanti_) _viññāna dhamma_ with the clinging, _rāgasandha_, one is delighted in the element of eye clearness and material object. If one is delighted with the element of eye clearness and material object, then he is delighted in the past. (It has been expatia- ted that the same applies to the remaining *āyatana*s).
