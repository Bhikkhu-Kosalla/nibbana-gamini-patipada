_Kiccâna_ .... All the santient beings mostly are clinging to the fact that (the belief that self always remains as self) one's form is everlasting, and that (self has a limit) there is a time when self exists not any more ( a view called _sassatadittihi ucchedaditthti_).

_Kiccâna_ .... He who sees, by _vipassanâ ñâna_ and _magga ñâna_, the nature of the cause of arising and of resultant formation in its true perspective of the _sankhâra loka_, there does occur such a thing as non-existance in such a person (a clinging to the belief that the self lost its existance one the living being died).

_Kiccâna_ .... In _sankhâra dhammas_ the clinging such as "mine, mine", attachment by craving = _tahnupaya_, attachment to the view of "the assume I" = _ditthupaya_, strong attachment = _upâdana_ (clinging), deep rootedness = _abhinivesa_ (adherence to one's belief) factors mostly wrapped the santeint beings around.

This Noble One, my disciple, do not adhere to, clings to nor cultivate in his citta these adherence = _upaya_, the strong clinging = _upâdan_, as the the assume I.

He does not have wrong belief nor wrong thought such as "**_Dukkhameva uppajjamânam uppajjati_, _dukkham nirujjhamânam nirujjhati =_ If something formed, it the suffering that is formed, if cessation occurs, then it is the dukkha which does cease".**

**\*Aparapaccayâ ñâmamevassa ettha hoti** =\* This disciple does not depend upon others to have acquired such belief. He knows by him self by virtue of the **_Attapaccekkha ñâna_.** _Kiccâna_ ....\** This much will suffice to have the right view = *sammâditthi\*

(_Sam_.-1: 257-258).

**_Lokasamudaya_** — **_Lokanirodha_**

Arising and Cessation of Mundane

Formation of _sankhâra_ due to _avijjâ_ and of _viññâna_ due to _sankhâra_ called the process of formation of called the mundane _sankhâra_ = _anulomapaccayâkâra_ = _anuloma_- _paticca_ _samuppâda dhamma_ is called **_Lokasamudaya_**. _Nibbattilakkhanâ_ called _upâda_ (arising) of the characters of the _paticca samuppâda_, such as _avijjâ_, _sankhâra_ - etc. is also called the **_Lokasamudaya_**.

Absolute dissolution (by way of _asesavirâga_ and _anuppâdanirodha_) of _avijjâ_ is due to _arahattamagga_. Because of this dissolution, by means of the non-reappearing cessation, the resultant _sankhâra_ ceases (by way of _asesavirâga_ and _anuppâdanirodha_) completely by non-reappearing cessation which is the process of dissolution of _sankhâra_

-   _patilomapaccayâkâra dhamma_ = _patilomapaticca samuppâda dhamma_ is also referrd to as **_Lokanirodha_**. The dissolution of _avijjâ_, _sankhâra_, etc., which are the characters of _paticca samuppâda_ and which are subject to change called _viparinâma lakkhanâ_, are also termed **_Lokanirodha_**.

If stated with reference to Patisambhidâ Pâli, _avijjâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdana_, _sankhâra_, _kamma dhammas_ etc. for which _sanmudaya saccâ dhamma_ as their cause clearly arises = clearly present. Due to this the cause _viññâna_, _nâma_-_rūpa_, _salâyatana_, _phassa_, _vedana_ etc. referred to as the resultant five clinging aggregates, the _dukkha saccâ_ (the truth of suffering), has clearly formed. These are all called the **_Lokasamudaya_**.

_Avijjâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdana_, _sankhâra_, _kamma_ etc., with _samudaya saccâ_ _dhammas_ as the cause, ceased absolutely because of the _arahattamagga_ (via the _asesavirâga_, _anuppâ- danirodha_), by means of a non-reappearable dissolution. Due to such a cessation the resultant _viññâna_, _nâma_-_rūpa_, _salâyatana_, _phassa_, _vedana_ etc. called the five clinging aggregates which are the truth of suffering ceased (via the _asesavirâga_, _anuppâdaniro- dha_) through a process of non-reappearable cessation, are also called **_Lokanirodha_.** The dissolution of the five clinging (or dissolution of the cause and consequences) by means of _viparinâma lakkhanâ_ is also the **_Lokanirodha_.**

When the noble disciple, the follower of the Buddha, discerns on the formation and process of formation, of cessation and its process by _vipassanâsammâditthi ñâna_, he would know that —

**_Dukkhameva uppajjamânam uppajjati_, _dukkham nirujjhamânam nirujjhati_** = If it arises, then it is the _dukkha_ which arises; if it ceases, then it is the _dukkha_ which ceases. In him there is no doubt, no scepticism.

As explained above _avijjâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdana_ called the _kilesavatta dhamma_ (the factors of recurrent of defilements) are just the _upâdânakkhandhâ_ (clinging aggregates). The _sankhâra_ – _kamma_, referred to as _kamma vatta_ (recyle of action), are also just the _upâdânakkhandhâ_. So are the _viññâna_, _nâma_-_rūpa_, _salâyatana_, _phassa_, _vedana_ etc., which are the _vipâkavatta dhammas_. These _upâdânakkhandhas_ are — _sankhittena_ _pañcuppâdânakkhandha dukkhâ_ (_Dî_.-2:243; _Ma_.-1: 82; _Ma_.-3: 292; _Abhi_.-2” 105), in accordance with _desanâs_, only the _dukkha dhammas_ which are being tortured by the phenomena of arising and perishing all the time.

It is expatiated as “if it arises, it is the _dukkha_ which arises; if it ceases, it is the _dukkha_ which ceases” and the meditator understands this arising and the process of arising, and ceasing and the process of ceasing of the _sankhâraloka_ by _sammâditthi ñâna_ and _maggasammâditthi ñâna_. In understanding the arising and its process, dissolution and its process of the _dukkha_ referred to as _lokasamudaya_ and _lokanirodha_, which kind of knowledge is involved, the _paccekkha ñâna_ or _anvaya ñâna_? See the following for the answer.

_Aparapaccayâ ñânamevassa ettha hoti_ (_Sam_.-2: 32).

**\*Aparapaccayâ**ti na parappacayena*, *aññassa apattiyâyetvâ attapaccekkhaññânamevassa ettha hotîti* (*Sam*.-*Tha\*.-2: 32).

In accordance with the opening of the Pâli text, this is not the kind of knowledge that ends up in individuals who acquired it by words of mouth from his predecessors. The Buddha expounded that, in fact, “In this case the disciple does not depend on others, he understands it by his self via _attapaccekkha ñâna_ (practical knowledge). Therefore, this understanding is the knowledge of _attapaccekkha ñâna_.

In this Suttana, the Buddha has expatiated with reference to the combination of these _lokî_ and _lokuttara sammâditthi_ which are the _vipassanâsammâditthi_ called the _lokî_- _samâditthi_ and _lokuttarasammâditthi_ called _maggasammâditthi_.

_Nâma-rūpaparicchedato patthâya sammâditthiyâ vattattâ lokiyalokuttaramissakam sammâditthim avoca_ (_Sam_.-_Tî_.-2: 38).

As the Buddha has sermoned _sammâditthi ñâna_ (knowledge of right understan- ding) starting from _nâmapariccheda ñâna_ (knowledge that discerns the corporeality and mentality as two separate groups), the _sammâditthi_, the combined _lokîlokuttara_, has been said to have indicated in this suttana (_Sam_.-_Tî_.-2: 38).

This _sammâditthi_ is the _catusaccasammâditthi_ (the right understanding of 4-fold noble truth). These are the right understanding of the truth of suffering, the right understanding of the truth of origin of suffering, the right understanding of the truth of the cessartion of suffering, and the right understanding of the truth of Path. The Buddha has instructed this knowledge of right understanding as **_attapaccekkha ñâna_** in Kiccâna- gutta Suttan. The same explanation has been given in the Atthakatthâ (book of meaning). That the Buddha has expounded from the _nâma_-_rūpapariccheda ñâna_ to _catusaccaditthi_ called the _attapaccekhha ñâna_ has again been indicated by the teachers.

In _Nibbânagâminipati_._p_ _dâ_ also, the followings have been written in accordance with the instructions given by the Buddha’s doctrines, Atthakathâ and Tîkâ.

1. Concentration on corporeality called _rūpakkhandhâ_ by _attapaccekkha ñâna_ to discern penetratively until _paramatta_ is attained has been described in section on Rūpakammatthâna. (Vol. I).
1. Concentration on corporeality called _rūpakkhandhâ_ by _attapaccekkha ñâna_ to discern penetratively until _paramatta_ is attained has been described in section on Nâmakammatthâna. (Vol. II).
1. The process of origin of _sankhâra loka_, called the _lokasamudaya_, which is the _anulomapaccayâkâra_ = _anuloma paticcasamuppâda_ _dhammas_, and concentration on these made by _attapaccekkha ñâna_ to discern penetratively until _paramatta_ is attained has been described in section on Paticcasamuppâda. (Vol. III).
1. Culturing of the _sankhâra dhammas_ by way of their _lakkhana_ (character), _rasa_ (taste), _paccuppatthâna_ (manifestation), and _padatthâna_ (proximate cause) has been described in section on Paticcasamuppâda. (Vol. IV).
1. Discerning penetratively of formation and its process, cessation and its process of these lokasamudaya and lokanirodha is has been described in section on Vipassanâ. Especially in Udayabbayânupassanâ ñâna section, they are given under the names **_Samudayadhammânupassî_ Section*, Vayadhammânupassî* Section** and **_Samudayavayadhammânupassî_ Section.** (Vol V).
1. _Vipassanâ_ exercise on the _adittha_ past and future _sankhâra_ (which do not belong to the present) _anvaya ñâna_ has been described in section on Udayabbayânupassanâ. (Vol. VI).

**What _Anvaya Ñâna_ Is**

Included in the knowledge of _catusaccasammâditthi ñâna_ is _dukkha saccâ_ named the five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_ which are meditated so as to attain _paramatta_ which understands penetratively by means of _sammâditthi_, which understand the _samudaya_ _saccâ_ penetratively = _sammâditthi_ which penetratively understands the formation of _dukkha saccâ_ because of _samudaya saccâ_. _Vipassanâ ditthi_ penetratively knows the true facts of the impermanence, of the suffering and of arising to a stage of _khanikanirodha_ (momentary cessation). The dissolution of the _samudaya saccâ dhammas_ by means of _anuppâdanirodha_ due to which _dukkha saccâ dhammas_ cease by way of _anuppâda- nirodha_ is understood penetratively by _vipassanâditthi_. The discerning _lokîmagga_ _dhamma_ referred to as _vipassanâ ñâna_ (insight knowledge); the knowledge of _vipassanâditthi_ that penetratively understands the facts of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of these _lokîmagga dhammas_; the _maggasammâditthi_ which* penetratively understands *asanñkhata dhâtu*, *nibbâna dhâtu* referred to as *nirodha saccâ* by *ârammanapativedha*; the knowledge of *maggasammâditthi* that penetratively understands *dukkha saccâ*, *samudaya saccâ* and *magga saccâ dhammas* by means of *asamohapativedha\* etc. are all sammâditthi ñâna and are instructed by the Buddha to be **_Aparappaccaya ñân_. _a = Attapaccakkha ñân_. _a_.** The Atthakthâ, Tîkâ also have explained in a similar way. If so a question arises as to whether or not an **\*anvaya**ñâ*.*n\* _a_ is involved in these _catusaccasammâ_- _ditthi ñân_. _a_. The following will answer this question.

**_Dhammañâna_** — _Ariyamagga ñâ_._n_ _a_ penetratively knows, taking the _dhamma_ of _nibbâna_, the _nirodha saccâ_, as the object by way of _ârammana pa_._t_ _ivedha_ which bears a meaning as the penetrative knowledge. By annihilation of _moha_ which hinders the understanding of the truths such as _dukkha saccâ_, _samudaya saccâ_, and _magga saccâ_, acquired the penetrative knoweldge by virtue of _asammohapa_._t_ _ivedha_. _Ariyaphala ñân_. _a_ (the Noble Fruit Knowledge) understands these, by taking the _dhamma_ of _nibbâna_, _nirodha saccâ_, via a penetrative knowledge of _asammohapativedha_. Seeing and knowing this way, _ariyamagga ñân_. _a_ included in the 4-fold _ariyamagga_ and the _ariyaphala ñâ_._n_ _a_, included in the 4-fold _ariyaphala_, are all called the _dhamma ñân_. _a_.

.

**_Anvaya ñâna_** — _Anvaya ñâna_ sees the Four Noble Truths penetratively and presently via _paccekkha ñâna_ (practical knowledge). In a similar way this knowledge knows “in the past as well as in future, only these five _khandhas_ (5-fold clinging aggregates) are the _dukkha saccâ_, only the _tahnâ_ is the _samudaya saccâ_, only the _nirodha_ _nibbâna_ noble _dhamma_ is the _nirodha saccâ_, and only the eight _maggañ_ are the _magga_

` `_saccâ_.”

` `In this way _anvaya ñâna_ is the kind of knowledge that always follows the _dhamma ñâ_._n_ _a_ (_T_. _î_.-_Tha_.-3: 202).

_Anvaya ñân_. _a_ is a knowledge which is formed corresponding to _dhamma ñâ_._n_ _a_. A knowledge which always follows the _dhamma ñâ_._n_ _a_.. The name _anvaya ñâ_._n_ _a_ is the name of **_paccavekkhana ñân_. _a_** (reflective knowledge) (_Sam_.-_T_. _ha_.-2: 62).

` `Therefore, note that **_paccavekkhana ñâna_** which arises corresponding to _dhamma ñân_. _a_ referred to as the _ariyamagga ñâ_._n_ _a_, _phala ñâ_._n_ _a_ = a reviewing knolwedge is called the **_anvaya ñân_. _a_**. In _lokuttarâcattusaccâsammâditthi ñâ_._n_ _a_, note that _navaya ñâ_._n_ _a_ is not included. This is all about the _anvaya ñân_. _a_, a knowledge that always follows _lokuttarâ ariyamagga ñâ_._n_ _a_ and _phala ñâ_._n_ _a_.

**The _Anvaya Ñâna_ that always follows the _Vipassanâ Ñâna_** **_Nâma-rūpaparicchedato pat_**.**_t_** **_hâya sammâditthiy_**.**_â_** **_vuttattâ lokiyalokut_**.**_t_** **_aramissaka_**.**\*m\*\*\*\***

_sammâdi_._t_._t_ _hi avoca_ (_Sam_.-_Tî_.2: 38).

As explained above by the teacher, the Buddha has preached the _sammâditthi_ _ñâna_ starting from _nâmaparicche_-_da ñâna_ and because of this there also is _anvaya ñâna_ which always follows _vipassanâ ñâna_ named _lokîcatusaccasammâditthi ñâna_. As the _anvaya ñâna_, which always follows the _ariyamagga ñâna_ and _phala ñâna_, is just only the reflective _paccavekkhana ñâna_, and is not included in _lokuttara catusaccasammâditthi ñâna_. Similarly _anvaya ñâna_, which always follows the _vipassanâsammâditthi ñâna_ referred to as _lokîcatusacca sammâditthi_, is just only a kind of _paccavekhhana ñâna_. It is not included in _lokî catusaccasammâditthi ñâna_. It is because _lokî catusaccasammâditthi ñâna_ has been described as _aparappaccaya ñâna_ by the Buddha in Kiccânagutta Suttana, and this **_aparappaccaya ñâna_** explained as **_attapaccekkha ñâna_** by atthakathâ.

See Nibbânagâminipatipadâ Vol. I in sections on Vipassanâ, Udayabbayânupas- sanâ for clarity of the Four Noble Truth during period of _lokîvipassanâ_. Similarly for discerning on the past and future sankhâra by _anvaya ñâna_ which always follows the _vippasanâ sammâditthi ñâna_ is given in section on Vipassanâ, Udayabbayânupassanâ, Bhañgânupassanâ.

**_Lokîcatusaccasammâdi_._t_._t_ _hi_**

The Buddha has critically analyzed the Eight Maggañ Dhamma in sections on Dhammânupassanâ, Magga saccâ of Mahâsatipatthâ Suttâna. Among these eight, Sammâditthi has been classed as four groups.

_Katamâ ca bhikkave sammâditthi_. _Yam kho bhikkave dukkhe ñânam_, _dukkha- samudaye ñânam_, _dukkhanirodheñânam_, _dukkhanirodhagâminiyâ ñânam_. _Ayam vuccati_ _bhikkhave sammâditthi_ (_Ma_.1: 88).

Bbikkhus …. What is _sammâditthi_? Bhikkhus … The following four knowledges are the _sammâditthi_ (_Ma_.1: 88).

1. The knowledge that recognizes the _dukkha saccâ_.
1. The knowledge that recognizes the _samudaya saccâ_ which is the cause of _dukkha_.
1. The knowledge that recognizes the _nirodha saccâ_ of _dukkha_.
1. The knowledge that recognizes the _magga saccâ_ which is leads to _Nibbâna_ where _dukkha_ has been eradicated (the practice laeding to the Path for attainment of Nibbâna).

**Discussion of Early Great Mathera**

In this _satipatthâna desanâ_ the Buddha has discussed on eight-fold maggañ and treated each analytically in the section on _magga saccâ_. On this fact there had been a discussion, called dhammasâkicchâ among the great matheras. The discussion on the practice of _satipatthâna_ on the eight _maggañ_ classes in Mahâsatipatthâna Suttana was

` `focussed upon as to whether

1. Pubbâsatipathânamagga = is the lokîsatipathâna to be practiced prior to attaining the ariya magga or
1. Has it been sermoned as combined _lokîlokuttara_ called _missakamagga_.

The mathera Tipitkacūlanâga said it is _pubbâgasatipatthâna magga_ = the _satipatthâna_ _magga_ which has to be fulfilled prior to acquring _ariya magga_. The Tipitakacūla _mathera_, the teacher of Tipitakasūlanâga mathera, has indicated _missakamagga_ as the _pubbâgasatipatthâna magga_, a combination of both _lokîsatipatthâna magga_ and _lokut_- _tarasatipatthâ magga_. But Tipitakasūlanâga mathera, as a student replied that it is the _pubbâgasatipatthâna magga_, and the teacher repeatedly said it is the _missakamagga_. Because of this repeated sermon by the teacher, the student does not prevent hom from doing so but has to remain quiet.

Later Tipitakacūla _mathera_, in an attempt to find the right answer, recited the Mahâsatipatthâna Pâli and found in its conclusion that the Buddha has admittedly state the right answer.

_Yo hi koci bhikkhave ime cattaro satipatthâne evum bhâveya satta vassâni .._ (_Ma_.-1: 90)

` `Bhikkave …. If a certain meditating monk meditated on the 4-fold _satipatthâna_, as I have instructed, for seven years (… he could attain either _arahatta magga_ or, if there still are remnant _kilesâ_, _anâgâmi magga_). When he arrived at this stanza, he came to realize what the right answer is.

_Lokuttaramaggo upajjitvâ satta vassaâni titthamâno nâma natthi_ (_Ma_.-_Tha_.-1: 235).

_Lokuttarâmagga_ is not going to remain throughtout the seven years’ duration (_Ma_.-_Tha_.-1: 235).

The Buddha decisively expounded as “the _missaka magga_ I have mentioned is not attainable in the Mahâsatipatthâna Suttan, but only the _pubbâgasatipatthâna magga_ is, as Culanâga has realized” (_Ma_.-_Tha_.-1: 235).

In this pubbabhâsatipatthâna magga are included the four kinds of _sammâditthi ñâna_ too. These four are the kinds of knowledge that a meditator must have exercised

and acquired before arriving at the the _ariya magga_.

1. The five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_, existing as the past, future, present, _ejjatta_,

_bahiddha_, _olârika_, _sukhuma_, _hîna_, _panîta_, _dūra_, _santika_, of 11 kinds, is the _dhammas_ of _dukkha saccâ_. The _attapaccakkha ñâna_, which can penetratively visualize this _dukha saccâ_, is the _sammâditthi_, which has the ability to understand in the _dukkha saccâ_ via the knowledge of _dukkhe ñâna_. The meditator must have acquired this _sammâditthi_ before attaining the _ariya magga_. By acquiring these knowledge in this way, the factors of the _dukkha saccâ dhamma_ can be visioned penetratively by virtue of _sammâditthi ñâna_ called **_attapaccakkha ñâna_**. Now the meditator is on the path leading to the _nibbâna_. Note that in this _dukkha saccâ_ group are included the past and future five-fold _upâdânak_- _khandhâs_.

2. The _upâdânakkhandha_, _kilesavatta_, _upâdânakkhandhâ_ and _sankhâra_-_kamma_ called

_kamma vatta upâdâbakkhandhâ_, headed by _avijjâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_ and which are the causes of five-fold _paccuppan patisandhekhandhâ_ etc. of five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_, are, in accordance with the _dhamma_ – _atîte hetavo pañca_ – etc., the *upâdânakkhandhâ*s of the past period. Again, _kilesa vatta upâdânakkhandhâ_, _kammavatta upâdâdankkhan_- _dhâ_ cultivated in the present life, the causes due to which there will appear resultant _upâdânakkhandhâ_ termed _jâti_ (_jarâmarana_) are the _idâhi hetavo pañca_, _âyatim phalapañca_ _desanâ_, and according to which they are just the _upâdânakkhandhâ_ of the future period.

The conspicuous resultant formation of five-fold _paccuppannavipâkavatta_ _vipâ_- _ka vatta upâdânakkhandhâ_ due to the past _upâdânakkhandhâ_ called _kilesavatta kamma- vatta_ as the cause, and because of culture of _kilesavatta kammavatta upâdânakkhandhâ_ in the present period has resulted in _vipâkavatta upâdânakkhandhâ_ to come, are to be known penetratively by oneself. **_Attapaccakkha ñâna,_** which penetratively visualizes these, is the _sammâditthi ñâna_ which enables one to see the cause of _dukka saccâ_ in accordance with _dukkhasamudaye ñânam_. The meditator must have already acquired this _sammâditthi ñâna_ view before attainment of _ariya magga_.

In such an endeavour should one employ _anvaya ñâna_ which sees by speculation, or by _attapacakkha ñâna_ which sees penetratively oneself? See the following.

_Aparapaccayo ñânamevassa ettha hoti_ (_Sam_.-1: 258).

**\*Aparappaccayâ**ti na aparappaccayena*, *aññassa apattiyâyetvâ attapaccakkhañâna- mevassa ettha ahotîti* (*Sam.*-*Ttha\*.2: 32).

According to this doctrine, it is not to be tried by _anvaya ñâna_ which sees by _anumâna_ speculative vision. It is not the knowledge handed down from one’s teacher nor that received from others. The endeavour must be made by **_attapaccakkha ñâna_** which is seen penetratively by oneself.

According to **_Ãhârasuttana_** (_Sam_.-1: 253) _desana_ method, the knowledge can be oriented toward the past it is possible to discern on _paticca samuppâda_, the cause-result relationship. (For a detail description see section on Paticca Samuppâda). (It does not necessarily mean to discern on all samsâric circus).

3. _Attapaccakkha ñâna_ which can discern on the formation of resultants _vipâkavatta_

_upâdânakkhandhâ_ from causes _avijja_. _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, _sankhâra_, _kamma_ etc. is **_Paccaya- to udayadassana ñâna_**. Because _janaka_ factors, which can directly give rise to the _upâ_- _dânakkhandha_, can be dicerned penetratively by the knowledge _paccayato udayadassana ñâna_, **_samudaya saccâ_** becomes clear (_Visuddhi_-2: 267).

4. Because of the _arahattamagga_, the causes like _avijja_. _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, _sankhâra_,

_kamma_ etc. have ceased by nature of _asesavirâga_ and _anuppâdanirodha_ in such a way that they are non-returnable, non-reappearable. Due to this cessation the future _khandhâs_ also ceased by non-returnable dissolution after _khandhaparinibbâna_ (passing away of the aggregates). The knowledge that can recognize this kind of cessation is **_paccayato vayadassana ñâna_**. Combination of the _paccayato_ _udayadassan ñâna_ and _paccayato_ _vayadassana ñâna_ is the **_udayabbayadassana ñâna_**.

Here too, for a meditator at worldling stage and when the _udayabbaya ñâna_ is in force the time to attain _ariyamagga_ and to enter _parinibbâna_ will just be the future. This future may either be the future of the present existance, any one life that is to come. A meditator must attempt to acquire the knowledge that understands penetratively, by himself through _attapaccakkha ñâna_, the fact that because of the cessation of causes via _anuppâdanirodha_, the resultant aggregates cease by way of _anuppâdanirodha_. The meaning of this _anuppâdanirodha_ is the **_lokînirodhasaccâ dhamma_**. Because of the penetrative vision of the dissolution of derived resultants due to cessation of the causes by way of the _anuppâdanirodha_, the _nirodha saccâ dhamma_ becomes clear by virtue of _paccayto_ _vayadassana ñâna_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 267).

The knowledge that can discern the formation of the cause _upâdânakkhandha_ and

the resultant _upâdânakkhandha_ is the _khanato udayadassana ñâna_. The **_dukkha saccâ_** becomes clear because of penetrative vision of _jâtidukkha_ (suffering of rebirth), the form- tion of _upâdânakkhandhas_ by means of knowledge of _udayadassana ñâna_. The knowledge that can discern the dissolution of these _upâdânakkhandhas_ is the _khanato vayadassana ñâna_. As the _khanato vayadassana ñâna_ penetratively understands the _maranadukkha_, the incessant dissolution of _upâdânakkhandhas_, even the **_dukkha saccâ_** become clear (_Visuddhi_-2: 267). These are the knowledges that understand the formation of _dukkha_ of the _upâdânakkhandhas_, called the _dukkha saccâ_. The _khanato udayadassana_ _ñâna_ and _khanato udaydassan ñâna_, when combined, become **_khanato udayabbaya dassana ñâna_**.

The above two kinds of _udayabbayadassana ñâna_ vision referred to as _paccayato udayabbayadassana_ and _khanato udayabbaya dassana_ are the _vipassanâditthi_. This _vipassanâditthi_—_paccayato udayabbaya_ and _khanto udayabbaya_, called the two _udayab_- _baya_ of the _sankhâra dhammas_, can momentarily eradicate the _sammoha dhammas_ which hinder visualizing these two. It is, therefore, the _lokîsaccâ dhammas_. Because of the knowledge of vision by these two _udayabbaya_ _ñâna_ the **_lokîmagga saccâ dhamma_** becomes clear in the continuum of a meditator (_Visuddhi_-2: 268).

By _Arūpasattaka vipassanâ_ method of meditation – when the past _manodvârika vipassanâjovîthi nâma dhamma_, called pre-_citta_, can be discerned by post-_citta_ called later _vipassanâ manodvârika vipassanâjovîthi nâma dhamma_, and when _vipassanâ ñâna_,

called _ñâna_ = _manodvârika vipassanâjovîthi nâma dhamma_ can be discerned again by _bhañgânupassanâ_, the _lokîmagga saccâ dhamma_ becomes apparent. (For the method of meditation see section on Vipassanâ meditation).

This is how four-fold _lokîsaccâ_ is acquired by means of _vipassanâditthi_ during exercising the _lokîvipassanâ_. This _vipassanâditthi_ called _attapaccakkha ñâna_ is one of the eight-fold _lokîmaggañ dhamma_. In Mahâsatipatthâna Suttana the Buddha has

` `instructed to acquire _pubbagasatipatthâna magga_ prior to attaining _ariya magga_.

A meditator might have wondered if there have ever been disciples who have penetratively visioned _lokasamudaya_ and _lokanirodha dhammas_ by _sammâditthi ñâna_, called _paccakkha ñâna_, after exercising along the line of these instructions. If so, then go through the extracts from **_Mahâtahnâsañkhaya Suttana_** given below.

Bhikkhus …. Do you ever discern, by _vipassanâsammâditthi ñâna_, that this five- fold _khandhas_ (5-fold aggregates) have appeared clearly?, asked the Buddha.

We do, my Lord, reply the bhikkhus.

Bhikkhus …. Do you ever discern, by _vipassnâsammâditthi ñâna_, that this 5-fold aggregate appear as a result of the causes that clearly exist?, ask the Buddha.

My Lord, we do, reply the bhikkhus.

Bhikkhus …. Do you ever discern that the resultant _khandha_ possesses the nature of cessation by _anuppâdanirodha_ because the causes cease by way of _anuppâdanirodha_? Ask the Buddha.

We do, my Lord, reply the bhikkhus (_Ma_.-1: 326).

These _bhikkhus_ penetratively know the fact that _sankhâra_ is formed because of _avijjâ_ formation, and because of _sankhâra_, _viñâna_ is formed, etc. of the processes of the _sankhâraloka_ referred to as _anuloma paccayâkâra_ = _anulomapaticca samuppâda_, the nature of the _lokasamudaya_, because of _arahatta magga_ of _avijjâ_ the nature of the _asesavirâga_ = the nature of absolute and non-returnable cessation by way of the nature of _anuppâdanirodha_. (For a broader description, see (_Ma_.-1: 327).

With regard to attaining the vision of _vipassanâ sammâditthi ñâna_, the Buddha has made many questions to these bhikkhus. From among these question and answers, some which are relevent are given.

**Questions and Answers**

The Bhuddha ask the Bhikkhus …. If you have indeed acquired knowledge and sight this way “ do you say the Buddha, as our teacher, is respectable, and with due respect to the Bhuddha we state this way?”

No, our Lord, we do not state this way, was the answer from the Bhikkhus.

Bhikkhus …. If you have indeed acquired knowledge and sight this way, do you state that “the Buddha as a _samana_ has expatiated this way, and we the _samana_ have said this way?”

No, our Lord, we do not state this way.

Bhikkhus …. If you have indeed acquired knowledge and sight this way, do you relay these to other teachers?

No, our Lord, we do not.

Bhikkhus …. If you have indeed acquired knowledge and sight this way, could these be, in essence, from the discipline and _kotuhala mañgalâ_ of many _samana_ and

` `_byahmana_ ?

No, our Lord, it could not be.

Yes, our Lord, we do.

Bhikkhus … _Sadhu_ = good. Bhikkhus …. With this _dhamma_, which you can see by yourself, which can bringforth benefit any time, which is an ideal to demonstrate to others, which should be maintained within your body and mind, which only the learned individuals can know and appreciate, I have directed you, my sons, to the _nibbâna_ (to have approached the _nibbâna_). Bhikkhus …. This is the _dhamma_, which you should discern; it can bring-forth benefit any time; it is demonstrable to others to exercise; it should be maintained with one’s body and mind; only the learned individuals can know and appreciate. In this way I have preached to you. I preach this _dhamma_ with reference to the fact that you have distinctly know by own (_Ma._-1: 332).\*

**_Sampati Dittha Sankhâra, Sampati Adittha Sankhâra_**

After going through various explanations given above, and if the meditator under- stands and contended with, he will also agree with the the division of the past and future _sankhâra dhammas_ into two classes as given below.

Among the characters of the _paticca samuppâda dhammas_ from the _avijjâ_ to _jaramarana_ are included the _dhamma_ groups of the past period, of the future and of the present. Similarly among the _samudaya dhamma_ groups are included the past causes called _dhamma_ groups of the past period, of the future and of the present. A meditator should partly acquire the knowledge of the characters of the _paticca samuppâda_ and the nature of interrelationship among these characters relative to meditator’s _pâramî_ _ñâna_. This knowledge is acquired by _vipassanâ sammâditthi ñâna_ called the _attapaccakkha ñâna_.

Again according to method of _saccâdesanâ_ – among the _dukkha saccâdhamma_ groups are included resultants of the past, future and the present referred to as _dhamma_ of the past period, of the future period and of the present period. In the same way, among the _samudaya saccâ dhamma_ groups are included the past cause referred to as past period _dhammas_, the present cause referred to as the present period _dhammas_, and for those who are still continuing the infinite rounds of rebirth, the future cause referred to as future period _dhammas_.

In the accounts of _lokînirodhasaccâ_ are included the future _dhamma_ groups for the one who is going to pass away in the present life, and later future _dhamma_ for the one who is going to pass away in any one of the future lives. The _lokîmagga saccâ dhamma_ is the process of _vipassanâ manodvârika jovîthi_ dictated by the practising _vipassanâ sammâditthi ñâna_ and is therefore the _dhamma_ groups of the present period. The _sâvakas_ should have tried to discern penetratively the four-fold _lokîmagga saccâ_ in part, before arriving at* the *ariamagga* with their corresponding *pârami*s via *attapaccakkha ñâna*, referred to as *vipassanâ sammâditthi ñâna*, which occur prior to *ariyamagga\*.

The above mentioned past, future (and present) _sankhâra dhammas_ discerned via the _attapaccakkha ñâna_, referred to as _vipassanâ sammâditthi ñâna_, are the **\*sampati dittha sankhâra** dhammas*. The journey through the sasâric circus is too long for a sâvaka to have discenred these *dhammas* completely. Those *dhammas* that have not been discerned by the *attapaccakkha ñâna*, referred to as *vipassanâ sammâditthi ñâna\*, are the **\*sampati adittha sankhâra** dhammas*. A meditator who has completed discerning the *sampati dittha sankhâra dhammas*, can do so in a similar way for the past and future *sampati adittha sankhâra dhammas* by knowledge of *anvaya ñâna*. It must be noted that this *anvaya ñâna* is the knowledge not included in *vipassanâ sammâditthi ñâna*, called *attapaccakkha ñâna\*, but a kind of **_paccakkhan ñâna_** that always follows the _vipassanâ ñâna_.

Only if the past, future and present _sankhâra dhammas_ are taken to be of two classes as _sampti ditthi sankhâra_ and _sampti aditthi sankhâra_, can the solution can be made. If all the past and present _sankhâra dhammas_ are blindly accepted as discernible by _anumâna_ only by _anvaya ñâna_, then the expations in relation to the penetrative knowledge by the _vipassanâ sammâditthi ñâna_, called _attapaccakkha ñâna_ of the nature\** of the relationship of the *paticca samuppâda*, and of four-fold *lokîsaccâ\*, would be of no meaning. The learned may sometimes have overlooked the fact.

If the division of the past and future *sankhâra*s into the past and future _sampti dittha_ and *sampti adittha sankhâra*s cannot be accepted, then the ofllowing expressions from Patisambhidhâ Magga Pâli.

_Jâtâ avijjâ paccuppannâ_, _sattâ nibbattilakkhanam vayo_, _anupassanâ ñânam_. R. _Jâto bhavo paccuppanno_, _tassa nibbattilakkhanam udayo_, _viparinâmalakkhanam vayo_, _anupassanâ ñânam_ (_Patisam._- 52).

[Even *paramatthadhammasabhâvalakkhanâ*, called the material body formation clearly as *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañga*, is said to have attained *patiladdhattabhâva* = *attabho*.]

` `The _paramatthadhammasabhâvalakkhanâ_ while in its formative stage, called _avijjâ_ which is (one’s own form) still attaining is the _paccuppanna dhamma_. The _sañkhatalakkhanâ_ which should be taken arising stage of _avijjâ_ is the _udaya_ = arising. The _sankhatalakkhanâ_ which is taken as deterioration is the perishing away = noted as the _vaya_. The _nupassanâ_ knowledge of concentration on the _udaya_ and _vaya_ time and again is the _udayabbayânupassanâ ñâna_. R.

The _paramatthadhammasabhâvalakkhanâ_ while in its formative stage, the _bhava_

(called _kammabhava_ + _upapattibhava_) still attaining, is the _paccuppanna dhamma_. The _asañkhatalakkhanâI,_ which can be taken as the arsing stage of that _bhava_ is the arising = noted as the _udaya_. The _sankhatalakkhanâ_ which is taken as deterioration is the perishing away = noted as the _vaya_. The _nupassanâ_ knowledge of concentration on the

_udaya_ and _vaya_ time and again is the _udayabbayânupassanâ ñâna_ (_Patisam_.- 52).

If a breakdown is made of the characters of the _paticca samuppâda_ with the _paccuppanna bhava_ in the middle, then _avijjâ_, _sañkhâra dhammas_ etc. are the _dhamma_ groups of the past period. _Upapattibhava_ referred to as _jâti_ is the _dhamma_ groups that belong to the future period. The _viññâna_, _nâma_-_rūpa_, _salâyatana_, _phassa_, _vedanâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_ and _kamma bhava_ are all _dhamma_ groups belonging to the preent period.

These _dhammas_, however, are *dhamma*s that have arisen, arising, and still to arise as _upâda_-_thî_-_bhañga_. These _dhammas_ are still included in the three *khana*s of _upâda_-_thî_- _bhañga_ duration, and still staitc in these three *khana*s. And during these three periods the _paramatthadhammasabhâvalakkhanâ_ referred to as the _paramattha_ material body, the _attabho_, are momentarily acquired and therefore termed as the _paccuppanna dhamma_.

What it really means is this. It is true that avijjâ is the _dhamma_ of past period. It has then existed clearly in the form of _upâda_-_thî_-_bhañga_. While existing so during that period, that _avijjâ_ is referred to as the _paccuppanna dhamma_. When the meditator discerns this _avijjâ_ via _udayabbayânupassanâ ñâna_, he must concentrate on, and acquire, the arising phase _upâda_ and perishing phase _bhañga_ of this _avijjâ_. If one can concentrate on the arising and perishing away of the _avijjâ_, then that _udayabbayânupassanâ ñâna_ is referred to be concentrating on the _avijjâ_ of the present period. Note that the same applies the concnetration on the characters of the _paticcasamuppâda_ during remaining three periods. In connection with this _paccuppanna dhamma_ the great teacher of the doctrine opened as follows. It has been translated by Pye Sayâdaw.

_Nayadassanavasena vâ evum vuttam_. _Pathamahñi paccuppannadhammânam udayabbayam disvâ atha atîtânâgate nayam neti_ (_Mahâtî_.-2: 423).\*

In another way — by nayadassana it means this way. To begin with acquire the _udayabbaya_ by _paccakkha_, and later the same applies for the past and future periods (Pyî.- Visuddhi Nissaya – 5: 165).

**What _Paticcasamuppâda Dhamma_ Is**

This cause-result relationship = _paticca samuppâda dhamma_ was not created by the Buddha himself. Whether or not the Buddhas, named _tathâgata_ (one who has found the truth), have appeared in this _loka_ (world), this causal relationship = _paticca samuppâda dhamma_ will still exist in this world. But only when *sammâsambuddha*s (the perfectly enlightened ones), named _tathâgata_, have appeared in this world expounded the cause-result relationship = _paticca samuppâda dhamma_, the sentient beings have the chance to know it (Sam.-1: 246. See Paccaya Suttan).

Suppose the Buddha has not appeared in this world, or the Buddha has appeared but sentient beings have not the chance to listen to his teaching, or they have did have the chance but were under the influence of such extreme beliefs as _sassataditthi_ and _ucchedaditthi_, then they would not be able to understand the _paticcasamuppâdha dhamma_.

This cause-result relationship = _paticcasamuppâdha dhamma_ have deep meaning. It is hard to understand. To the Venerable Ãnanda, who expressed _paticcasamuppâdha_ to be simple and shallow, was cautioned by the Buddha as “Mâhevum Ãnanda mâhevum Ãnanda, my young brother Ãnanda do not say this way, Ãnanda do not say this way.” (_Dî_.- _Sam_.- 2: 47; _Sam_.-1: 318).

However hard and deep it may be, the _paticcâsamuppâda dhamma_ will have to be clearly and analytically understood by _attapaccakkha ñâna_ and _sammâditthi ñâna_ etc. of the three _pariññâ_. Without penetratively understanding this way escape from vicious rounds of rebirth, ageing, suffering, the death and recurrent of rebirths. Without the knowledge of the cause-result relationship = _paticcasamuppâda dhamma_, no one should be recognized as _samanabyâmana_ (see _Sam_.- 1: 255 – 256).

The Buddhas, who have arisen, arising and going to arise know the this _paticca_ _samuppâda dhamma_ analytically, and that is the reason why they are able to have arisen, still arising and going to arise. As long as the sentient beings are ignorant of the _paticca_ _samuppâda dhamma_, they will be under influence of the _sassataditthi_ and _ucchedaditthi_ and will still be bounded by miserable suffering. Therefore, those who want to escape from various _sansâravatta dukkhas_ must try to penetratively understand the _paticca_ _samuppâda_ via _sammâditthi ñâna_ called _attapaccakkha ñâna_. This has many times been advised in Nidânavaggasamyutta *desana*s (see _Sam_.-1: 257; Kiccânagutta Suttana etc.).

**_Tadanvaya Dhammas in Patisambhidâmagga Pâli_**

_Aniccato manasikaroto adhimokkhabahulassa sandañdariyam âdhipateyam hoti_, _bhâvanâ cattârañdariyâni tadanvayâ honti_, _sahajâtapaccayâ honti_, _aññamaññapaccayâ_

R. _Anattato mansikaroto vedabahulassa pañiñdariyam âdhipateyam hoti_. R. (*Patisam.*245-246).

**\*Tadanvâyâ hontî**ti tam anugâmini tam anuvattinî honti* (*Patisam\*.-Tha.-2: 161).

The _sankhâra dhammas_ taken to heart as _anicca_, and the determination as _anicca_

-   in individual with high _adhimocka_ (_saddhârimockkha_) determination (deter-mined faith), _saddhindriye_ (faculty of faith) is his principle. In _vipassanâ_ meditation the four- fold *indriya*s (controlling principles), such as effort, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom, are always associated with that principle. R.

The _sankhâra dhammas_ taken to heart as _dukkha_ is peacefulness = in one who is fully relaxed _sammâdhindre_ (faculty of concentration) is his principle. In the _vipassanâ_ meditation the the four-fold *indriya*s (faith, effort, mindfulness, wisdom), are always associated with that principle. R.

In wise individual who takes the _sankhâra dhammas_ to heart as _anatta_, in him _paññindre_ (faculty of widom) is the principle. In the _vipassanâ_ meditation the the four- fold *indriya*s (faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration), are always associated with that principle. R. The are _sahajâta_-_paccaya_ (conascence condition), _aññamañña_-_paccaya_ (mutuality condition), _nissaya_-_paccaya_ (dependence condition), _sampayutta_-_paccaya_ (relation of association) and functional similarity. From sense of functional similarity, it is the _bhâvanâ_ (mental culture). A meditator practises on good exercise termed _sammâ_- _patipanna_ (having the right view). The meditator is taken as practising for maturity of _indre_, referred to as _indriyabhâvana_ (power of mental culture). A certain individual practises concentration on micchâpatipatta procedure. Then he cannot be taken as taken as practising for maturity of _indre_, referred to as _indriyabhâvana_ (*Patisam.*245-246).

There are fve classes of _indre_: _saddhâ_ (faith), _vîriya_ (effort), _sati_ (mindfulness), _sammâdhi_ (concentration) and _paññâ_ (wisdom). Then any one who takes the _sankhâra_ _dhammas_ as _anicca_ and concentrate on it, the _saddhindre_ is his principle. To this are associated the the four-fold _indre_: _vîriya_, _sati_, _sammâdhi_ and _paññâ_. This _saddhâ_ and the four-fold _indre_ arise in association with each other within a _cittakhana_ (thought moment). _Saddhâ_ supported these four by force of _sahajâta_, _aññamañña_, _nissaya_ and _sampayutta_. Therefore, these four-fold _indre_ have been expounded to be **_tadanvayadhamma_** which is associated with _sammâdhindre_.

In an individual who takes _sankhâra dhammas_ as _anatta_ to heart, the _paññañdre_ is his principle. The _indre_ such as _saddhâ_, _vîriya_, _sati_, _sammâdhi_ are always associated with the _paññañdre_. This _paññañdre_ supports these four via the forces of _sahajâta_, _aññamñña_, _nissaya_ and _sampayuttapaccaya_. Therefore, these four-fold _indre_ are always associated with the _paññañdre_ and are expatiated as **_tadanvayadhamma_**.

These ***tadanvayadhamma*s** are the _dhammas_ (mental perception of _vipassanâ_) formed in association with, and in reciprocal support of each other, by way of _sahajâta_, _aññamñña_, _nissaya_ and _sampayuttapaccaya_, within a _vipassanâjo_ and a _cittakhana_.

It is not the kind of _anvaya ñâna_ referred to as analytic _paccavekkhana ñâna_, nor included in the _vipassanâditthi ñâna_, which always arises in associated with _vipassanâsammâditthi_ _ñâna_ called the _attapaccakkha ñâna_ as explained above. It is neither the kind of _anvaya ñâna_, referred to as _paccavekkha ñâna_, always formed in association with _lokuttaramagga ñâna_ and _lokuttaraphala ñâna_ nor is it included in

` `_ariyamagga ñâna_ and _ariyaphala ñâna_.

**_Anvaya Ñâna_ that is always associated with _Ariyamagga Ñâna_**

In **Ñanavatthu Suttan** of Nidânavaggasamyutta Pâli the Buddha indicated (44) kinds of *sampatti*s (sustained deep mental absorption) existing termed as _ñânavatthu_ (mental material) knolwedge. The 11 characters of the _paticcasamuppâda_ from _jarâmarana_ through _sankhâra_ have been expatiated to be endowed with four kinds of knowledge. Altogether there will be (11 x 4 = 44) _ñânavatthu_. Here some examples will be presented.

1. _Jarâmarana ñânam_ = the knowledge that understands the _jarâmarana_,
1. _Jarâmaranasamudaye ñânam_ = the knowledge which understands the origin of the _jarâmarana_,
1. _Jarâmarananirodha ñânam_ =* the knowledge that understands the cessation of the *jarâmarana\*,
1. _Jarâmarananirodhagâminiyâ patipadâya ñânam_ = the knowledge that understands the _nirodha saccâ,_ the truth of cessation of the _jarâmarana_ = the*  
   \*
   ` `knowledge that* understands the practice of attainment of _nibbâna_. R.\*

1. _Sankhâresu ñânam_ = the knowledge that understands the *sankhâra*s,
1. _Sankhârasamudaye ñânam_ = the knowledge that understands the origin of the *sankhâra*s,
1. _Sankhâranirodha ñânam_ = the knowledge that understands the _nirodha saccâ_, the truth of cessation, of _sankhâras_,
1. _Sankhâranirodhagâminiya patipadâya ñânam_ = the knowledge that understands the _nirodha_, the cessation, of *sankhâra*s = the knowledge that understands the \*
   ` `practice leading to _nibbâna_.

This is how each character of _paticcasamuppâda_ has the four _saccâ_ (truth) giving a total of (44) 11 characters.

1. _Jarâmarana_ refers to the aggregates which have the nature of _jarâmarana_ (ageing, decay and death). The expression that knowledge that understands the _jarâmarana_ refers to the knowledge which understands _dukkha saccâ_ (truth of suffering) of _upâdânakkhandhâ_ (the clinging aggregate), which have the nature of _jarâmarana_.
1. _Samudaya_ which is the cause of _jarâmarana_ is _jâti_. _Jâti_ is the beginning of life which has the nature of _jâti_ or the nature of _upâda_ (arising). The knowledge that understands this _jâti_ is knowledge that understands the _samudaya_ (arising) of the cause of _jarâmarana_.
1. _Jarâmarananirodha dhamma_ is the _nibbâna_. This _nibbâna_ = the knowledge that understands the _nirodha saccâ_ is the knowledge that understands the _marananiro_-

` `_dha saccâ_.

4. _Jarâmarannirodhagâminipatipadâ_ is the eight-fold _ariyamagga_ (Noble Eight-fold Path) related _to ariyamagga_ (the Noble Path). The knowledge that understands the Noble Eight-fold Path is the knowledge that understands the practice leading to the _nibbâna_ where _jarâmarana_ has ceased.

The origin of _jâti_ is the _kamma bhava_ (sensual existance); the origin of existance is the _upâdâna_ (clinging to existance); the origin of _upâdâna_ is _tahnâ_ (craving); the origin of _tahnâ_ is the _vedanâ_ (feeling); the origin of _vedanâ_ is _phassa_ (contact); the origin of the _phassa_ is the _sa_._l_ _âyatana_ (sense bases); the origin of _sa_._l_ _âyatana_ is the _nâma_-_rūpa_ (mind and matter); the origin of _nâma_-_rūpa_ is the _viññâna_ (perception); the origin of _viñ_- _ñâna_ is the _sankhâra_; and the origin of _sankhâra_ is the _avijjâ_ (ignorance). This is distinct. In this way each of the 11 characters of _paticca samuppâda_ has four factors, making it (44) mental properties altogether. (See _Sam_.-1: 288 - 290 for a broader treatment).

Again in the same Suttana the Buddha has preached on the arising of _anvaya ñâna_

` `in this way.

_Yato kho bhikkhave ariyasâvako evum jarâmaranam pajânâti_, _evum jarâmaranasamu- dayam pajânâti_, _evum jarâmarananirodham pajânâti_, _evum jarâmarananirodhagâminin patipadam pajânâti_. _Dhamme ñânam so iminâ dhammena viditena akâlikena pattena_

` `_pariyogâh_._l_ _ena atîtânâgate nayam neti_ (_Sam._-1: 289).

_Ettha ca na catusaccadhammena vâ sakkâ atîtânâgate nayam netum_, _catucassena pana maggañânena patividdhe parato paccavekkhañânam nâma hoti_, _tena nayam netîti veditabbâ_ (_Sam_.-_Tha_.-2: 62).

Bhikkhus …. An _ariyasâvaka_ (Noble Disciple) knows the following.

1. He understands the _jarâmarana_,
1. He understands the _samudaya_ as the cause of _jarâmarana_,
1. He understands the _nibbâna dhamma_ as the truth of cessation of the _jarâmarana_,
1. He understands the _magga saccâ_ which is the practice leading to attainment of

` `_nirodhanibbâna_ where _jarâmaran_ has ceased.

` `This the **_dhamma ñâna_** of the _ariyasâvaka_ = the _ariyamagga ñâna_ (knowledge of Noble Path) which understands the _catusaccadhamma_ (dhamma of Four Noble Truth). This _ariyasâvaka_, _ariyamagga ñâna cakkhu_ (eye of wisdom for Noble Path) (by nature of _asammohapativedha_), that is sighted by _paccakkha_, that is to be understood by _ariyamagga paññâ_, that could result any time (= by one’s own _ariyamagga_ after which ariyaphala could result any time), attaining the Four Noble Truth by means of which the _catusaccadhamma_ is acquired, by this _catusaccâdhamma_ contained in it by _ariyamagga_ _ñâna_ or in other words by _ariyamagga ñâna_ which penetratively understands the _catusac_- _cadhamma_, and applicable also in past and future, i.e arrives at the _paccavekkhanâ ñâna_ that understands the four-fold _saccâdhamma_ of the past and the future (_Sam_.-1: 289).

_Ye kho keci atîtamaddhânam samanâ vâ byâmanâ vâ jarâmaranam abhaññamsu_, _jarâmaranasamudayam abhaññamsu_, _jarâmarananirodham abhaññamsu_, _jarâmarana- nirodhagâminim patipadam abhijânissanti,_ _abhaññamsu_, _sabbete evameva abhaññamsu_, _seyathâpâham etarahi_.

_Yepi hi keci anâgatamaddhânam samanâ vâ byâmanâ vâ jarâmaranam abhijânissanti_, _jarâmarasamudayam_ _abhijânissanti_, _jarâmaranirodham abhijânissanti_, _jarâmarana- nirodhagâminim patipadam abhijânissanti, sabbete evameva patipadam abhijânissanti,_ _seyathâpâham etarahîti. Idamassa anvaye ñânam_.

_Yato kho bhikkhave ariyasâvakassa imâni dve ñânâni parissudhâni hunti pariyodâtâni dhamme ñânañca anvaye ñânañca_. _Ayam vaccati bhikkhave ariyasâvako “ditthisam- panno” itipi_, “_dassanasampanno_” _itipi_, “_âgato imam saddhammam_” _itipi_, _passati imam saddhamam” itipi_, “_sikkhena ñânena samantagato” itipi_, “_sikkhaya vijjâya samantagato” itipi_, “_dhammasotam samâpanno_” _itipi_, “_ariyo nibbedhikapañño_” _itipi_, _amatadvâram âhicca titthati_” _itipîti_ (_Sam_.1: 289).

In the past these *samanabyâmana*s understood the _jarâmarana_, _jarâmaranasamu- daya_, _jarâmarananirodha_, the way of practice leading to _jarâmarananirodha_. They

` `understood these the way I do today.

` `In future too, these *samanabyâmana*s will understand the _jarâmarana_, _jarâmarana_- _samudaya_, _jarâmarananirodha_, practice leading to _jarâmarananirodha_. These *samana- byâmana*s will understand the way I do today. The same applies to the knowledge in the past and present. This the **_anvaya ñâna_**, which is always associated with _ariayamagga ñâna_.

Bhikkhus …. An _ariyasâvaka_, at a certain time can be taken as one who possesses the _dhamma ñâna_ called _ariyamagga ñâna_ which understands the _ariya sacca dhammas_ by virtue of _asamohapativedha_, the anvaya ñâna called the _paccavekkhana ñâna_ which understands the association with _ariyamagga ñâna_, and these two *ñâna*s are untainted and clean. Bhikkhus …. Then this _sâvaka_ can be taken as one complete with right view, right eye of wisdom, who has acquired the _dhamma_ of morally good people, who has the sight of this dhamma, competant with eye of wisdom and _sikkha ñâna_ still practicing, competant with eye of wisdom and _vijjâ ñâna_ still practicing, well attained the peaceful _dhamma_, one with _ariyapaññâ_ (Noble Knowledge) which eradicates the mass of _kilesâ_, and one at the door to the _nibbâna_ (_Sam_.1: 289).

This _anvaya ñâna_ is the kind of knowledge which is always associated with _ariya_-_magga ñâna_ or _ariyamaggañânaphalañâna_. When you have understood the 4-fold _saccâ_, then you can exercise on it as an object.

Among these *ñâna*s, which is the _dhamma ñâna_? The _paññâ_ in four-fold _ariya_- _magga_ and four-fold _ariyaphala_ is the _dhamma ñâna_. The ariyasâvaka, by _ariyamagga_ _cakkhu ñâna_ referred to as _dhamma cakkhu_, that is visible and understandable via by nature of _asamohapativedha_, that give rise to result in no time, because of its existance to acquirement of the four-fold Noble Truth, that is to attain _catusaccadhamma_, that reflects _ariyamagga ñâna_, this _catusaccadhamma_ = by _maggañâna dhamma_ that penetratively understands _catusaccadhamma_, applicable to the past and future = aquires the _paccavek_- _khanâ ñâna_ which understands the past and future four-fold Noble Truth.

In the past these *samana byâmana*s have penetratively understood the _dukkha_, the _dukkhasamudaya_, the _dukkhanirodha_, and the practice leading to _dukkhanirodha_. With the exception of _tahnâ_, they have understood only the _tebhūmaka dhamma_ (_dhamma_ belonging to three stages of being) penetratively as _dukkha_. These *samana*s have understood only the _tahnâ_ penetratively as _dukkha samudaya_. All these *samana*s have understood only the _asankhata dhâtu_ (the absolute element) penetratively to be peaceful element, the _nibbâna dhamma_, as the _dukkhanirodha_. They all have understood this eight-fold _magga_ (Noble Path of Eight Contituents) _dhamma_ penetratively as the only exercise which could lead to _dukkhanirodha_.

In future too these _sammana byâmanas_ will understand penetratively the _dukkha_, _dukkha samudaya_, _dukkhanirodha_, and exercise leadding to _nirodha saccâ_. With the exception of _tahnâ_, they will understand only the _tebhūmaka dhamma_ penetratively as _dukkha_. These *samana*s will understand only the _tahnâ_ penetratively as _dukkha samudaya_. All these *samana*s will understand only the _asankhata dhâtu_ penetratively to be peaceful element, the _nibbâna dhamma_, as the _dukkhanirodha_. They all will understand this eight-fold _magga_ _dhamma_ penetratively as the only exercise which could lead to _dukkhanirodha_. In this case _paññâ pajânana_. R. _Amoha dhamma vicaya_ _sammâditthi ñâna_ does appear. This knowledge should be called **_anvaya ñâna_** (_Abhi_.-2: 341-342).

_Yadetam iminâ catusaccâgpcram maggañânam adhigatam_, _tena ñânena kâranabhūtena atîtânâgate paccavekkhanañâna sankhâtam nayam neti_ (*Abhi.-Tha.-*2: 398).

The _ariyamagga dhamma_ penetratively understands, by nature of _arammanapati_- _vedha_, the _nirodhasaccâ nibbâna dhamma_ taking it directly as the object of meditation. By eradication of the _moha_ (ignorance), which hinder understanding the four _saccâ_, remaining three _saccâ_ and be understood penetratively by virtue of _asamhohapativedha_. Therefore, the _ariyamagga ñâna_ understands _nirodha saccâ_ taking it as the object, by _kiccasaccâ_ understand the remainining three *saccâ*s; only the _magga ñâna_ can understand all the four *saccâ*s. The _ariyamaggaphala ñâna_ is understands only the _nirodhasaccâ_ by virtue of the nature of _arammanapativedha_ which is taken as the object. Referring to this kind of understanding, knowledge of _ariyamagga ñâna_ and of _ariyam_- _maggaphala ñâna_ has been indicated to be the _dhamma ñâna_ (*Abhi.-Tha.-*2: 398).

This meditator have acquired the _ariyamagga ñâna_ which has taken the four-fold _saccâ_ as its object. Because of _ariyamagga ñâna_, _anvaya ñâna_, referred to as _paccavek_- _khana ñâna_, appears according to method applicable to concentration on the past and future. With this _anvaya ñâna_, the meditation can be made on both the past and future (*Abhi.- Tha.-*2: 398).

This _anvaya ñâna_ is just a kind of knowledge that is always associated with the _paccavekkhana ñâna_. This _anvaya ñâna_ is the _paccavekkhana ñâna_ which is always associated with _ariyamagga ñâna_ and _ariyaphala ñâna_, but not included in _attapacca- vekkha ñâna_ called _ariyamagga sammâditthi_.

In this way there are two _anvaya ñâna_, one which is associated with _vipassanâ ñâna_ and one associated with _lokuttara ariyamagga ñâna_ and _ariyaphala ñâna_. This _anvaya ñâna_, however, is not a kind of _dhamma_ which occurs in association with either _ariyamagga ñâna_ nor _ariyaphala ñâna_ within a _cittakhana_ or a _jovîthi_. It is the kind of _paccavekkhana_ _ñâna_ which appears after arising of _vipassanâjo_, _maggajo_, _vîthijo_, with an elapse of many *jovîthi*s.

The **\*anvaya ñâna** dhamma*s** in** the above mentioned Patisambhidâmagga Pâli are are not included in the two kinds of *anvaya ñâna*. The Buddha did not preach as *anvaya ñâna*, but as *tadanvaya dhamma*. These *tadanvaya dhamma*a are forceful *indriyabhâvanâ dhamma*s which are formed in association within a *vipassanâjo\* _cittakhana_, and in support of each other of the _sahajâta_, _aññamañña_, _nissaya_, _sampa- yutta_, and _paccaya_ forces.

Now extracts from *suttana*s\* such as Aparijânanasuttana will be described. **_Sabbam bhikkhave anbhijânam aparijânam avirâjayam appajayam abhabbo dukkhakka-_**

_yâya_. R.

_Sabbam ca kho bhikkave abhijânam parijânam pajaham bhabbo dukkhakkhayâya_ (_Sam_.-2: 249 – 250).

_pahânapariññâti_ (*Sam.-Tha.-*3: 6).

Bhikkhus …. If _rūpa_-_nâma dhamma_ (the five _upâdânakkhandhâ_ = 12 species of _âyatana_ =) are not understood completely by means of _ñâtapariññâ_, not analytically understood by _tîranapariññâ_, and if the _tahnâ_, which is clinging on to the _rūpa_-_nâma dhamma_, has not been eradicated completely by means of _pahânapariññâ_, the _dukkha_ cannot be dissolved. R.

Bhikkhus …. If _rūpa_-_nâma dhamma_ (the five _upâdânakkhandhâ_ = 12 species of _âyatana_ =) are understood completely by means of _ñâtapariññâ_, analytically understood by _tîranapariññâ_, and if the _tahnâ_, which is clinging on to the _rūpa_-_nâma dhamma_, has been eradicated completely by means of _pahânapariññâ_, then the _dukkha_ can be dissolved (*Sam.-Tha.-*3: 6).

_Paccakkhakaranattena ñâtapariññâ tîranapariññâ ca gatitâ hoti_ (_Sam_.-_Tî_.-2:65).

In accordance with this opening and _samvannanâ_ (praises) the _pariññâ paññâ_ (knowledge) are the _attapaccakkhan ñânas_. These *pariññâ*s will further be explained. In this case too, the _pariññâ_ can be classed as _lokî pariññâ_ and _lokuttara pariññâ_. Again in the _lokî pariññâ_ are _ñâtapariññâ_, _tîranapariññâ_ and _pahânapariññâ_ as three classes.

In _lokuttara pariññâ_ also are _ñâtapariññâ_, _tîranapariññâ_ and _pahânapariññâ_. First the three _lokî pariññâ_ will be presented.

**The _Lokî Ñâtapariññâ_**

_Tattha sankhârapricchedato patthâya yâva paccayapariggahâ ñâtapariññâya bhūmi_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 241).

Among those three *pariññâ*s “_rūpa_ is the _dhamma_ that is subject to change, and _vedanâ_ is the _dhamma_ which has the nature of suffering.” By having the ability to analytically understand the ultimate reality of each of the general characters of the five- fold _khandhâ_, the knowledge which can analyse the mind and matter called _nâma_- _rūpapariccheda ñân_. _a_ is acquired. This knowledge plus the _paccayapariggaha ñâ_._n_ _a_, which can canalyse and culture the causes and results in the past, future and present moments, are called the **_ñâtapariññâ_** (_Visuddhi_-2: 241).

_So_ “_idam_. _nâma-rūpam_. _na hetu na paccayâ nibbattam_. , _sahetu sappaccayâ nibbattam_. . _Ko kapmanmaaspsaa chceatyuâ_, ,_k âoh pâarnaap apcaccacyaây oc_”_ât_”_it iu ptaaspsaar pikakchcaanytaom_ .“ _avvaivjjaâtpthaacpceatyvââ_,* “*taahtînteâppia pcaccacyaay, â\*

The meditator who has cultivated the five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_ = 12 _âyatana_ = _rūpa_-_nâma_ _dhammas_ analytically by means of knowledge to arrive at _paramatthadham_- _masabhâvalakkhan_. _â_, should note that “it is not that the _nâma_-_rūpa_ is formed as a direct result of _hetu_ (the root) as a cause = _paccaya_ (condition) as a cause, without distinct j*u*a*p*n*a*a*t*k*th*a*a* _m_.( p*b*r*h*o*a*d*k*u*a*c* t(isounp)p, orwt)h aisc ha ccaouuseld.

is _hetu_ which is the direct cause of a result = the present of the d. istinct _janaka_ as a cause,

.

the _paccaya_ as a cause which is supportive = distinct _upatthambhaka_ as a cause. Then what are these causes called _hetu_ = _janaka_? If the supporting cause the _paccaya_ = _upat-_ _thambhaka_ are investigated

1. Because of the cause referred to as _avijjâ_,
1. Because of the cause referred to as _tah_._n_ _â_,
1. Because of the cause referred to as _kamma_,
1. Because of the cause referred to as _âhâra_,

the results appear, and when it is understood by penetrative knowledge, then because of _avijjâ_, _kammaja rūpa_ (_rūpa_ produced by _kamma_) has resulted; the _avijjâ_ is the cause, the _kammaja rūpa_ the result, ….

The causes and results are analytically recognized in this way—

1. In the past too there were causes and results.
1. In the future too there will be the causes and results.
1. In the present also there are the causes and results.

There is no creator other than the causes and consequences, nor is there any individual who has been created by a creator. The cause and result of _rūpa_-_nâma_ = only the _sankhâra dhamma_ groups are there — determination has been made via _paccakkha ñâna_ for which _vicikicchâ_ in the past, future and the present (doubtful state) can be overcome. This is called **_ñâtapariññâ_** which can analytically recognize the _sankhâra_ _dhammas_ such as

1. _Rūpa dhamma_
1. _Nâma dhamma_
1. The cause
1. The result

` `which are objects of concentration for the insight knowledge (_Abhi_.-_Ttha_.2: 241 – 242).

In accordance with the opening of the doctrines, only when the causes and results of the past, the future and the present periods can be cultivated analytically can the

` `_ñâtapariññâ_ be acquired. This fact must be obediently maintained.

**_Lokî Tîranapariññâ_**

“_Rūpam aniccam_, _vedanâ aniccâ_”_tiâdinâ nayena tesamyeva dhammânam sâmañña- lakkhanam âropetvâ pavattâ lakkhanârammanikavipassanâ paññâ **tîranapariññâ** nâma._

R. _Kalâpasammasanato pana patthâya yâva udayabbayânupassanâ tîranapariññâya bhūmi_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 241).

The nature of the arising and dissolution of the _rūpa_ and _vedanâ_ is discerned by knowledge and recognized as _anicca_ (impermanance).” In this way the five-fold _upâdâ_- _nakkhandhâ_ and _rūpa_-_nâma dhammas_ are discerned taking the three general characters such as _aniccalakkhanâ_, _dukkhalakkhanâ_ and _anattalakkhanâ_ are taken as the object. In discerning this way the _vipassanâ_ knowledge that recognizes the _aniccalakkhanâ_, _dukkhalakkhanâ_ and _anattalakkhanâ_ as the object is **_tîranapariñña_**. R. The _rūpa_ and _nâma dhammas_ are discerned by

1. Taking _rūpa_ and _nâma_ as individual group, taking it as two individual groups, or
1. By five _khandha_ way, taking these as five individual groups, or
1. By 12 _âyatana_ way, taking these as 12 individual groups, or
1. By 18 element way, taking these as 18 individual groups.

Method meditation on the three general characters of the individuals as groups is called the method of _kalâpasammasana_. From that _kalâpasammasana_ _ñâna_ to the attain- ment of _rūpa_-_nâma_-cause-result = arising and perishing away of the _sankhâra dhammas_ are concentrated until _paccuppanakhanan_ (momentary present) is acquired. The knowledge of mediatation on the three general characters is the _udayabbayânupassanâ ñâna_. This is the common abode of the **_tîranapariññâ_** (_Visuddhi_-2: 241).

**The Three _Lokuttara Pariññâ_**

_Yassamâ vâ ñâtatîranapariññâyopi tadatthâyeva_, _yassamâ ca ye dhamme pajahati_, _te niyamato ñâta ceva tîritâ ca honti_, _tassmâ pariññattayampi iminâ pariyâyena magga- ñânassa kiccanti veditabbam_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 335).

_Tassâ bhañgânupassanato patthâya yâva bhūmi_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 335). The _pahânapariññâ_ is the field ranging from _bhañgânupassanâ ñâna_ to _ariyamagga ñâna_.

_Nippariyâyena pahânapariññâ nâma maggañânanti_ “_yâva maggañânâ bhūmî_”_ti vattam_ (_Mahâtî_.-2: 508). Definitely the _pahânapariññâ_ is the _ariyamagga ñâna_. That is the reason why _atthakathâ sayâtaw_ has expounded the field up to the _vipassanâ_ to be that of the _pahânapariññâ_.

Therefore, if stated in another way, the _ñâtapariññâ_ and _tîranapariññâ_ are for the _pahâna pariññâ_ as a result. _Ñâtapariññâ_ and _tîranapariññâ_ are arising for the _ariya- magga ñâna_ as a result. The _kilesâ_ clinging on to the five-fold _khandhâ nâma_-_rūpa_ _dhamma_ are completely eradicated by _ariyamagga dhamma_ via _samuccheda_. The _ariyamagga dhamma_ has analytically understood these _dhammas_ as the law of constancy. They have been investigated and have been determined to be _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _antta_. It should be noted that all the three *pariññâ*s are, taken literally, the function of the _ariyamagga ñâna_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 335).

` `What the above book of doctrines means is this. The *ariyamagga dhamma*s possess the force to completely eradicate the *kilesâ*s hence definitely named _pahâpariññâ_. The *vipassanâ ñâna*s possess the force to momentarily eradicate the *kilesâ*s, and because of this the _ariyamagga dhammas_ are definitely named _pahânapariññâ_ and literally named _ñâtapariññâ_ and _tîranapariññâ_. The reason for such a name is as follow.

Because the _ariyamagga dhamma_ can eradicate the *kilesâ*s completely, it gets the name **_pahâna_**. It is also named _pariññâ_ as it can understand penetratively, by concen- tration on as object, and analytically, the _asankhata_ element, _element of peacefulness the nibbâna dhamma_. That is why the _ariyamagga dhamma_ is definitely the _pahânapariññâ_. As the *vipassanâ ñâna*s possess the force which can eradicate the *kilesâ*s momentarily, they are literally named as _pahânapariññâ_. Furthermore the _ariyamagga dhamma_ is definitely named as _pahânapariññâ_, whereas definitely, and literally also as _ñâtapariññâ_ and _tîranapariññâ_. It is so because of the following reasons.

The _ariyamagga dhamma_ which, of necessity, eradicates the *kilesâ*s completely, and so is named **_pahâna_**.\** The *asañkhata* element and element of peacefulness, *nibbâna\* _dhamma_ which, of necessity should be understood, concentrated penetratively and analytically as the object for which it is named _pariññâ_. That is why the _ariyamagga_ _dhamma_ is definitely named _pahâna pariññâ_.

The _ariyamagga dhamma_ can penetratively visualize the four-fold noble truth via two *pativedha*s called the _ârammanapativedha_ and _asammohapativedha_. In these two, the _ârammanapativedha_ refers to understanding the object of concentration penetratively. _Ariyamagga dhamma_ can visualize the _nirodha saccâ dhamma_, called _asañkhata_ element and the element of peacefulness, the _nibbâna dhamma_, analytically and penetratively. Because of this, the _ariyamagga dhamma_ is also named as _pariññâ_. And so the _ariya- magga dhamma_ is nominated as the _pahânaparññâ_.

The _ariyamagga dhamma_ can penetratively understand the four noble truth by means of the two *pativedha*s called _ârammanapativedha_ and _asammohapativedha_. Of these two, the _arammanapativedha_ refers to its power of penetrative discernment of the object of concentration. The _ariyamagga dhamma_ can penetratively visualize the _asañkhata_ element and the element of peacefulness, the _nibbâna dhamma_ as the object. In this such visualization, _moha_ and _avijjâ_ which can hinder penetratively understanding the four noble truth, have been eradicated completely. From functional point of view, the knowledge of the four noble truth has been accomplished at the same time with this era- dication. The knowledge of the four noble truth following the eradication of the _moha_ and _avijjâ_ is known as _asammohapativedha_.

The object, of concentration by way _asammoha pativedha_, the _vipassanâ_ knowledge such as

1. The five _upâdânakkhandha_ = _dukkha saccâ dhamma_, existing as 11 species such as the past, the future, the present, _ijjatta_, _bahiddha_, _olârika_, _sukhuma_, _hîna_, _dūra_ and _santika_, and
1. The cause and its consequence, the causal relationship, which is the _samuppâda_ called the \*samudaya saccâ dhamma\*\*\*

have been accomplished, and acquired simultaneously. Hence literally the _ariyamagga_ _dhamma_ is named as _ñâtapariññâ_ also.

Again, the _ariyamagga dhamma_ has eradicated completely the _moha_ = _avijjâ_ which hinder the understanding of the features of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of the _dukkha saccâ dhamma_ and _samudaya saccâ_. At the same time the attainment of the investigative and analytical knowledge of the features of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of the _dukkha saccâ dhamma_ and _samudaya saccâ_ has been accomplished.

` `Before acquirement of the _ariyamagga dhamma_, and during practicing on the _pubbabhâgapatipadâ_ prior to _ariyamagga dhamma,_ a meditator has to make effort to acquire the two *pariñña*s -- the _ñâtapriññâ_ which analytically understands the features of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of the _dukkha saccâ dhamma_ and _samudaya saccâ dhamma_, and the _tîranapariññâ_ which understands these features investigatively. These two *pariññâ*s are concerned only with the attainment of ariyamagga dhammas named the _pahânapariññâ_, for which it literally means the _ñâta pariññâ_ and _tîrana_- _pariññâ_.

If the five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_ and _rūpa-nâma dhamma_ are not understood analytically by means of the three *lokîpariññâ*s and the three *lokuttarapariññâ*s there will be no end to suffering of the rounds of rebirth. Only if these are understood ana- lytically will there an end to the suffering of the rounds of rebirth., as instructed by the Buddha in the above mentioned Parijânana Suttana. Remember, with a clear conscious mind, that in such an analytical understanding are also included the five *upâdânakhan- dhâ*s of the past and of the future.

In continuation **_Mahâvajîravipassanâ ñâna_** of the _Buddhisatta_ will be described as extracted from the Second volume of Mahâbuddhavañ.

**The Bodhisatta exercised on sixtythree hundred millions of** **_Mahâvajîravipassanâ_**

As stated in earlier sections, the characters of the *kilesâ*s such as _lobha_, _dosa_ have been eradicated by virtue of _dâna_ (charity) etc. of _kusala_ _pâramî_, the _moha kilesâ_ and its associated features, which could hinder the journey to the _nibbâna_, are also eradicated. The Bodhisatta, who has accomplished all these, meditated on the _mahâ_- _vajîravipassanâ dhammas_ in the early morning of the full moon of Kason, the second month of the year. The way meditation exercised is given below in brief.

At an age of authority, the three periods of humans, celestial beings, _byammâ_ and sentient beings residing in each of the solar system of a hundred million universes, and essence of the _dhamma_ actually existing then are discerned by the Bodhisatta. The Bodhisatta realized that, however many there are of men, celestial beings, _byammâ_, in each of the universe, _avijjâ_ and _sankhâra_ (the cause of the past period) as the true _paramatthasabhâva dhamma_, _viññâna_, _nâma_-_rūpa_, _salâyatana_, _phassa_ and _vedanâ_ (the result of the present period), _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, _kamma bhava_ (the cause of the present period) together with (the _upapatti bhava_ as) _jâti_, _jarâ_ + _marana_ (the results of the future period). The Bodhisatta well understood the _paramatthasabhâva dhamma_ referred to as the12 classes of _paticca samuppâda_.

When the Bodhisatta discerned on the essence of _paramatthasabhâva dhamma_ existing in the three periods of men, celestial beings, _byammâ_, and sentient beings, the essence of the 12 features of _paticca samuppâda_ such as _avijjâ_, _sankhâra_, _viññâna_, _nâma_-_rūpa_, _salâyatana_, _phassa_, _vedanâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, _bhava jâti_, _jarâ_ + _marana_ (the objects of _vipassanâ_) are well realized. The discernment was made similarly of *paramatthasabhâva dhamma*s of the three periods of men, celestial beings, _byammâ_, and sentient beings in other solar systems. When discerned in this way, Bodhisatta realized the 12 features of the _paticca samuppâda_, which are to be taken as the object of concentration, similar to those of this solar system.

When the Bodhisatta concentrated on the essence of the _paramatthasabhâva_ _dhamma_ of series of _khandhâ_ of men, celestial beings, _byammâ_, and sentient beings in the three periods in this a hundred million universe called the age of authority, the Bhodhisatta realized the groups of _dhamma_ which are to be taken as object of _vipassanâ_ concentration by virtue of His knowledge. These objects are hundreds of millions of _avijjâ_, _sankhâra_, _viññâna_, _nâma_-_rūpa,_ _salâyatana_, _phassa_, _vedanâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, _bhava jâti_, _jarâ_ + _marana_ (when these 12 are added), the _vipassanâcâra_ (objects to be concentrated) which add up to 12 hundred million in all.

To eradicate the fifteen hundred tangling factors of _kilesâ_, the Bodhisatta entered the _ânâpâna_ jânic state (= entered the fourth janic state of _ânâpâna_) to sharpen the knowledge of Mahâvajira vipassana as a bush clearer would use his sharpened dagger to cut away the diffusedly growing brushes. After entering this janic state the Bodhisatta analysed each and every factor, numbering 12 hundred million in all, of the _paticca samuppâda_ taking one by one their feature of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ as the object.

Therefore of 12 hundred million factors of _paticca samuppâda_, each has three knowledge such as _aniccavipassanâ nana_, _dukkhavipassanâ nana_, and _anattavipas- sanâ nana_, and totally there will be\*\* sixtythree hundred millions in all.

(This Mahâvijaravipassanâ ñâna in brief has been describe in the opening of Uparipannâtîkâ anupada, page 275, and in that 3rd vol. Mahâkahndhaka sâriputtamogalâ- na pabbjjâ, page 229, of Vinisâratthadîpanîtîkâ).

Every Bodhisatta, when about to attain full enlightenment, naturally analyze the _paticca_ _samuppâda dhamma_ forward and backward. Our Bodhisatta, in a similar way to the predecessors, has analyze the _paticca samuppâda_ in details. Then the whole solar system with its ten thousand *lokadhâtu*s trembled.

Similar to the nature of every Buddhas = (of every Bodhisattas), the Bodhisatta, after acquiring the 36 thousand millions of _mahâvipassanâ sammasana nana_ of the 12 species of _paticca samuppâda_, entered the fourth jhanic state of _ânâpâna_. (It is the act of sharpening the knowledge of _udayabbaya nana_ etc. of higher knowledge of _vipassanâ nana_ at the fourth _jhanic_ state of _ânâpâna samâpatta_). After entering the fourth jhanic state of _ânâpâna_ (= after sharpening the higher _vipassanâ nana_), the Bodhisatta acquired the _udayabbaya ñâna_ etc. of the higher _vipassanâ_ _ñâna_ in the _dhamma_ groups of the five _khandhâs_ with ease.

(It must be noted that as the Bodhisatta, after being ordained and learning the three Pitakas, has exercised on _vipassanâ_ to attain _udayabbaya ñâna_, _bhañga ñâna_, _bhaya ñâna_, _âdînava ñâna_, _nibbidâ ñâna_, _muccitukamayattâ ñâna_, _patisankhâ ñâna_ and _sankhârūpekkhâ ñâna_, and the force of knowledge in meditation by means of 36 hundred million _mahâvijaravipassanâ sammasana ñâna_ as mentioned above, have been so great, the above _vipassanâ nanas_ are attained without difficulty. Ref. Jînâlañkâratîkâ p. 55).

This is about the Mahâvajiravipassanâ ñâna in Mahâbhuddavañ vol. II, pp. 334-338.

**Extracts from _Bodhikathâ_**

The Bodhisatta, after conquering the _devaputtamâra_ before the sunset on the fullmoon day of Kason, in the year (of Mahâsakkarâja), 103, acquired the _pubbenivâsâ- nussati abhiññâna_ in the early part of that night, _dibbacakkhuabiññâna_ at _majjhimayâma_ and _âsavakkhaya ñâna_ at _pacchimayâma_ and finally attained the Buddhahood.

Then the Buddha, sitting cross-legged on the _Aparâjita_ throne at the base of the bo tree, enjoyed the mental ease of _arahattaphala_ and _vimutti_. On the early , middle and last parts of the night of a day after the full moon of Kason, the Buddha took to the heart

the following.

_Avijjâpaccayâ sankhâra_, _sankhârapaccaya viññânam_. R. _Evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti_. _Avijjâyatveva asesaviraganirodhâ sanhâranirdohâ_, _sankhâranirodha viññânanirodho_. R. _Evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hoti_ (_Vi_.-3:1).

` `Because of _avijjâ_, *sankhâra*s are formed; because of _sankhâra viññâna_ is formed. R. In this way the nature of cause and result of this mass of _dukkha_, in no way associated with _sukha_, become apparent. Because of _arahattamagga_, _avijjâ_ alone ceases utterly* and so does *sankhâra*. Because of cessation of *samkhâra*, *viññâna* ceases. R. In this way, nature of cessation of this mass of *dukkha*, in no way associated with *sukha*, become clear (*Vi\*.-3:1).

In this way by the process of _samsâra vatta dukkha_ referred to as **_anuloma_**, by the process of dissolution of _samsâra vatta dukkha_ referred to as the **_patiloma_,** the _paticca_ _samuppâda dhamma_ was taken to the heart by the Buddha.

After analyzing the _paticca samuppâda_ forward and backward and after taking it to the heart proclaimed the first _udânagâthâ_ during the early part of the night*,* and the second _udânagâthâ_ during the middle and the third _udânagâthâ_ during the last part of the night. In this case Vinayamahâvaggaatthakathâ explained in the following way.

_Bhagavâ hi visâkhapunnamâya rattiyâ pathamayâme pubbenivâsam anussari_, _majjhimayâme dibbacakkhum visodhesi_, _pacchimayâme paticca samuppâdam anuloma-_

_patilomam manasi katvâ “idâni karuno uggamissatî”ti sabbanutam pâpuni_. _Sabbanu- tappatthisamanantarameva ca aruno uggacchi_, _tato tam divasam teneva pallañkena_

_vitinâmattvâ sampattâya pâtipadarattiyâ tîsu yâmesu evum mansi katvâ imâni udânâni udânesi_ (_Vi_.-_Tha_.-3: 237).

Buddha (= the Bodhisatta) during the first part of the night of fullmoon of Kason, in the year (of Mahâsakkarâja), 103, reviewed on the series of khandhâs of the previous life by means of _pubbenivâsânussati abiññâna_. In the middle part of the night clearness of _dibbacakkhu abiññâna_ was accomplished. When _paticca samuppâda_ was concen- trated forward and backward, and taken heart during the last part of the night Full Enlightenment was acquired at a “time when the dawn was about to have arrived.” After the full enlightenment was attained, the dawn has occurred. Whiling away by sitting cross-legged during, after and a day later, a day of emergence = a day after the full moon day of Kason has arrived. Then the nature of _paticca samuppâda_ was taken to heart, reviewing forward and backward, and proclaimed following _udânagâthâ_.

1. _Yadâ have pâtubhavunti dhamma_, _âtâpino châyato byâmanassa_.

_Athassa kañkhâ vapayanti sabbâ_, _yato pajânâti sahetudhammam_ (_Vi_.-3: 2).

Or due to forceful concentration. _Bhyâmanassa_ = as all ill-deeds have been detached (condoned) in the _santâna_ of the Lord Rahantâ named Visuddhibhyâmana. _Yadâ_ = at that moment. _Dhammâ_ = 37 speceis of *bodhipakkhiya dhamma*s. _Have_ = in fact. _Pâtubhavunti_ = have arisen clearly. _Yato_ = as the 37 species of *bodhipakkhiya dhamma*s have arisen clearly. _Sahetudhammam_ = _avijjâ_ etc. as the causes together with the resultant _sankhâra_ etc. such as the mass of _dukkha_ are. _Pajânâti_ = understood analytically and penetratively by means of _vipassanâpaññâ_ and _maggapaññâ_. _Atha_ = when _paticcadhâtu samuppâda_ is clearly and definitely visualized in this way. _Assa_ = in the _santâna_ of the _rahantâ_. _Sabbâ_ = completely. _Kañkhâ_ = because of wrong view on and ignorance of the _paticca samuppâda_, 16 species of wrong view on the _rūpa_-_nâma dhamma_ occurring in three periods. _Vapayanti_ = _viapayanti_ = perished like the snow

` `melting away in the sun.

2. _Yadâ have pâtubhavunti dhamma_, _âtâpino jhâyato bhyâmanassa_.

_Athassa kankhâ vapayanti sabbâ_, _yato khayam paccayâbam avedi_ (_Vi_.-3: 2).

_Âtâpino_ = _samappadhâna_ which possesses power to streneously depress the 1500 species of *kilesa*s. _Châyato_ = various kinds of _samatha_ object such as _ânâpâna_ etc., and firm and strong concentration power in visualizing fixedly on the general characters of _anicca,_ _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of the _sankhâra dhamma_ to attain _jhânamagga_. Or because of forceful concentration. _Bhyâmanassa_ = as all ill-deeds have been detached in the _santâna_ of the Lord _Rahantâ_ named Visuddhibhyâmana. _Yadâ_ = at that moment. _Dhammâ_ = 37 speceis of *bodhipakkhiya dhamma*s. _Have_ = in fact. _Pâtubhavunti_ = have arisen clearly. _Yato_ = as the 37 species of *bodhipakkhiya dhamma*s have arisen clearly. _Paccayânam_ = of the causes such* as *avijjâ* etc. *Khayam* = *asañkkhata nibbâna dhamma* where (*avijjâ*) have ceased. *Avedi* = has come to underastand clearly and penetratively. *Atha\* = where

those causes have been annihilated = when _asankhatadhâtu_, the element of peacefulness _nibbâna dhamma_ named _paccayakkhaya_ is understood clearly. _Assa_ = in the _santâna_ of the _rahantâ_. _Sabbâ_ = completely. _Kañkhâ_ = because of ignorance of the _asañkhatadhâtu_ the element of peacefulness,* the *nibbâna dhamma*, wrong view *dhamma* groups that would have appeared in the interior. *Vapayanti* = *viapayanti\* = perished like the snow melting away in the sun.

3. _Yadâ have pâtubhavunti dhamma_, _âtâpino châyato byâmanassa_. _Vidhūpayam titthati mârasenam_, _suriyova obhâsayamantalikkham_ (_Vi_.-3: 2).

_Ãtâpino_ = _samappadhâna_ which possesses power to streneously depress the 1500 species of *kilesa*s. _Châyato_ = various kinds of _samatha_ object such as _ânâpâna_ etc., and firm and strong concentration power in visualizing fixedly on the general characters of _anicca,_ _dukkha_ and _anatta_ of the _sankhâra dhamma_ to attain _jhânamagga_. Or because of forceful concentration. . _Bhyâmanassa_ = as all ill-deeds have been detached in the _santâna_ of the Lord _Rahantâ_ named Visuddhibhyâmana. _Yadâ_ = at that moment. _Dhammâ_ = 37 speceis of *bodhipakkhiya dhamma*s. _Have_ = in fact. _Pâtubhavunti_ = have clearly arisen.

(_So byâmano_ = the noble _rahantâ_. _Tehi dham_- _mehi_ = with those 37 species of _bodhipakkhiya dhammas_). _Mârasenam_ = a force of 10 lines of mâra of _kâmarâga_ are. _Vidhūpayam_ = _Vidhūpayanto_ = destroyed utterly. _Titthati_ = brilliant with knowledge like the brilliantly shining sun (_Vi_.-3: 2).

(_Mahâbuddhavañ_-_Du_: 357 – 361).

Here, it must be noted that “the Buddha, during the life of a Bodhisatta and before the attainment of the Buddhahood, the _paticca samuppâda_ was analytically concentrated in a similar way.”

**Extracts from Gotamakacetiyasuttan**

The 500 monks, who have entered world of _sâsanâ_ from the life of bhâmana and who were experts in horology, learnt the _pariyatti dhamma_ without difficulty. For this reason _mâna_ have appeared in their _santâna_. The Buddha realized that this _mâna_ is an impedement to acquirement of _arahattaphala_. So the Buddha preached **_Mūlapariyâya- suttan_** (_Ma_.-1: 1) and **_Mūlapariyâyajâta_** (_Jâtaka_-_Ttha_.-2: 237) to these 500 monks so as to deplete them of their _mâna_. When it was done with, the monks exercised on _vipassanâ_, _samatha_ and _bhâvanâ_, the _indare_ in their _santâna_ become mature, and when the maturity is so attained, the Buddha expatiated this _Gotamacetiyasuttan_ at the _Gotamakacetî_ in _Vesâlî_.

_Abhiññâyâham bhikkhave dhammam desemi no anabiññâya_, _sanidânâham bhikkhave dhammam desemi no anidânam_, _sappâtihâriyâham dhammam desemi no appâtihâriyam_. _Tassa mahsam bhikkhave abiññâya dhammam desayato no anabiññâya sanidânam dhammam desayato no anidânam appâtihâriyam dhammam desayato no appâtihâriyam karanîyo ovâdo karanîyâ anussâsanî_, _alañca pana vo bhikkhave tutthiyâ alam attamanatâya alam somanassâya_ “_sammâsambuddho bhagavâ_, _savekkhâto dhammo_, _suppatipanno samgho_”_ti_ (_Am_.-1: 280).

Bhikkhave …. I preach only after understanding the _dhamma_ penetratively by means of _paccakha ñâna_. I do not preach without understanding the _dhamma_ penetra- tively by means of _paccakha ñâna_. I only preach the _dhamma_ with _nidâna_, but not the one without _nidâna_. Bhikkhave …. I only preach the _dhamma_ that possesses the force to dispel the one that is opposite, but not the one without this force. Now I have admonished this _ovâda dhamma_ once to you, and have made repeated admonishing _anusâsanî_ to you all.

Bhikkhus … you all should willing accept the fact that

\1. The Buddha is endowed with _sammâsambuddha guna_ by which the five-fold

` `_ñeyadhamma_ called _sankhâra_, _vikâra_, _lakkhana_, _nibbâna_ and _paññatta_ are understood by _sayambhūñân_._a_, a kno.wledge acquired by himself, without the assitance. of anyone, and which .has the ability to visualize penetratively.

1. The Buddha is endowed with _savekkhâta gu_._na_ by which the 10-fold _dhamma_ as _Maggaphala_, _Nibbâna_, _Dhammakkhan_ are admonished, from beginning

through middle to the end, apprehensively.

2. The eight noble disciples are endowed with _suppa_._tipanna gun_. _a_ by which the _niyânika dhamma_ are obediently exercised so as to escape from the _samsâra_-

` `_vatta_.

The Buddha has preached that it should be willingly accepted, should have mind to accept heartily, and should have clear _somanassa_ to happily accept (_Am_.-1: 280).

_Imassamim ca pana veyâkaranassamim bhaññâmâne sahassî lokadhâtu akampitta_

(_Am_.-1: 280).\*

As this **_Gotamakacetiyasuttan_** _desana_ was delivered in simple language, but not in _gâthâ_, the earth in a thousand _lokadhâtu_ trembled violently (_Am_.-1: 280).

_Idañca suttam sutvâ pañcasatâ bhikkhu tassamamyevâsane saha patisambhidâhi arahattam pâpunamsu_ (_Ma_.-_Tha_.-1: 61)

` `After listening to this _gotamacetiyasuttan_, the 500 monks attained the _arahattaphala_ together with the four-fold _patisambhidâ ñâna_ there and then.

This is the _suttana_ for which even the non-living earth, situated in a thousand _dhâtu_, stands in support of its truth. If you, as a living _saviññânaka_ complete with clever mind and knowledge, can stand in support of the truth as does the earth, then you have approached the main path of _magga_ leading to _nibbâna_.

Here, in this explanation emphasis is put on the process of _sankhâra loka_ called _lokasamudaya_ = _anulomapaccayâkâra_ = _anulomapaticca samuppâda dhamma_ and the process of cessation of _sankhâra loka_ = _patilomapaccayâkâra_ = _patilomapaticca samuppâda dhamma_. The Buddha, as a Bodhitassa during the night when about to acquire the Buddhahood, meditated on the nature of _paticca samuppâda_ via _vipassanâ ñâna_ called _paccakkha ñâna_ by way of _anulomapatiloma_ (_Vi_.-_Ttha_.-3: 237). After attaining the Buddhahood too* the nature of *paticca samuppâda* was meditated and analyzed forward and backward by *anulomapatiloma*. With regard to this the Buddha has noted in the *Buddhavañ\* this way.

[Here it should be noticed that in knowledge of the Buddha, although all the *dhammas* have been visualized in all possible features (even as a Bodhisatta on the night when the Buddhahood was to have attained), and when the exercise was primarily on the *paticca samuppâda*, *vipassanâ* was taken to the heart. And that the *dhamma* of *paticca* *samuppâda* was deep, subtle and heard to visualize. Therefore, only the process of the arising and dissolution of *paticca samuppâda* was discerned to be the the process of *sansârvatta dukkha*.] (_Mahâbuddhavañ_, Vol 2: 356).

Only after visualizing penetratively by himself, the Buddha admonished the _sansâravatta dukkha_ = process of arising and of perishing away of _sankhâraloka_ referred to as _anulomapatiloma paticca samuppâda dhamma_ to his disciples. That the disciples could understand as instructed has been expatiated by the Buddha in the *suttan*s of which the second _ariyasâvakasuttan_ is given.

**The Second _Ariyasâvakasuttana_**

Bhikkhus …. There are two kinds of knowledge: one acquired after being taught called _âgamsuta_ and the other self-acquired through practice, called _adhigamsuta_. In the _santâna_ of my noble _sâvaka_ who is endowed with these two, there will not arise, in his mind, such thought as “How? Which _dhamma_ would arise when a certain _dhamma_ is in existence clearly? Which is the _dhamma_ due to the existence of which there would arise a _dhamma_?

What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the *sankhâra*s ? What are the _dhammas_ that would cause arising of _viññâna_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _nâma-rūpa_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _salâyatana_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _phassa_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _vedanâ_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _tahnâ_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _upâdâna_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _bhava_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _jâti_? What are *dhamma*s that would cause the arising of the _jarâmarana_?

No such a thought ever comes across his mind. Bhikkhus …. In fact, in the _santâna_ of my noble disciple who is possessed of the two kinds of knowledge, one acquired after being taught called _âgamsuta_ and the other self-acquired through practice, called _adhigamsuta_, there would arise only the penetratively visualizing **_aparappaccaya ñâna_** = **_attapaccakkha ñâna_**. This knowledge enables the _sâvaka_ to understand the cause-result relationship = _anulomapaticca samuppâda dhamma_ penetratively by his own self, with respect in this case to the fact that there is no one but self to rely upon.

If this cause is really in existence, there will be a clear result. It is because of this cause that the resultant has arisen. – If there is _avijja_ as a cause, there will be _sankhâra_ as a resultant. If there is _sankhâra_ as a cause, there will be _viññâna_ as a resultant. If there is _viññâna_ as a cause, there will be _nâma-rūpa_ as a resultant. If there is _nâma-rūpa_ as a cause, there will be _salâyatana_ as a resultant. If there is _salâyatana_ as a cause, there will be _phassa_ as a resultant.* If there is *phassa* as a cause, there will be *vedanâ* as a resultant. If there is *vedanâ* as a cause, there will be *tahnâ* as a resultant. If there is *tahnâ* as a cause, there will be *upâdâna* as a resultant. If there is *upâdânaa* as a cause, there will be *bhava* as a resultant. If there is *bhava* as a cause, there will be *jâti* as a resultant. If there is *jâti* as a cause, there will be *jarâ* + *marana\* as a resultant.

This is the only kind of knowledge the _sâvaka_ will have. That noble _sâvaka_ of mine would come to differentially know as “This is way the _sankhâra loka_ arises” by means of **_aparappaccaya ñâna_** = **_attapaccakkha ñâna_**.

Bhikkhus …. In the _santâna_ of my noble disciple who is endowed with two kinds of knowledge, the _âgamsuta_ and _adhigamsuta_, not a single thought ever comes across his mind – “How come? ? Which _dhamma_ would not arise when a certain _dhamma_ is not in existence clearly? The cessation (by way of _anuppâdanirodha_) which _dhamma_ would cause the dissolution of corresponding resultant _dhamma_? –

Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the *sankhâra*s would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _viññâna_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _nâma-rūpa_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _salâyatana_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _phassa_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _vedanâ_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _tahnâ_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _upâdâna_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _bhava_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _jâti_ would not arise? Which are the *dhamma*s due to the absence which the _jarâ_ + _marana_ would not arise?

This kind of thought never crosses his mind. In fact, in the _santâna_ of my noble disciple who is possessed of the two kinds of knowledge, one acquired after being taught called _âgamsuta_ and the other self-acquired through practice, called _adhigamsuta_, there would arise only the penetratively visualizing **_aparappaccaya ñâna_** = **_attapaccakkha ñâna_**. This knowledge enables the _sâvaka_ to understand the the cessation of the cause- result relationship = _patilomapaticca samuppâda dhamma_ penetratively by his own self, with respect in this case to the fact that there is no one but only self to rely upon.

If this cause has not been clearly in existence, there could not be a resultant _dhamma_; due to cessation (by _anuppâdanirodha dhamma_) of this cause, the result ceases (by _anuppâdanirodha dhamma_).

If there is no _avijjâ_ as a cause, there will be no _sankhâra_ as a result. If there is no _sankhâra_ as a cause, there will be no _viññâna_ as a result. If there is no _viññâna_ as a cause, there will be no _nâma-rūpa_ as a result. If there is no _nâma-rūpa_ as a cause, there will be no _salâyatana_ as a result. If there is no s*alâyatana* as a cause, there will be no _phassa_ as a result. If there is no _phassa_ as a cause, there will be no _vedanâ_ as a result. If there is no _vedanâ_ as a cause, there will be no _tahnâ_ as a result. If there is no _tahnâ_ as a cause, there will be no _upâdâna_ as a result. If there is no _aupâdâna_ as a cause, there will be no _bhava_ as a result. If there is no _bhava_ as a cause, there will be no _jâti_ as a result. If there is no _jâti_ as a cause, there will be no _jarâ_ + _marana_ as a result.

This is the only knowledge the _sâvaka_ has in mind. That noble _sâvaka_ of mine would come to differentially know as “This is way the _sankhâra loka_ ceases (by way of _anuppâdanirodha dhamma_)” by means of **_aparappaccaya ñâna_** = **_attapaccakkha ñâna_**.

Bhikkhus …. Then, in this way my noble _sâvaka_ understands differentially as “this is the way of arising and and of cessation of the _sankhâra loka_” via **_aparappaccaya ñâna_** = **_attapaccakkha ñâna_**. Bhikkhus …. At that time my noble _sâvaka_ unerringly understands, via **_aparappaccaya ñâna_** = **_attapaccakkha ñâna_**, the true nature of the arising and cessation of the _sankhâra loka_. Bhikkhus …. Then this noble _sâvaka_ of mine is recognized as one endowed with **_sammâditthi_**, with right _dassana ñâna_, who has attained the _dhamma_ of good deeds called _saddhama_, who has acquired the vision of the _dhamma_ of good deeds called _saddhama_, who is endowed with still practicing _sakkha ñâna_ vision, who is endowed with still practicing _vijjâ ñâna_, one who has attained the _dhamma_ called _dhammasota_, one endowed with _nibbedhikapaññâ_ (called _vipassanpaññâ_ _maggapaññâ_) which is clean and superior and which can annihilate the mass of _kilesa_, and one who is at the door of _nibbâna_ (_Sam_.-1: 306-308).

As the _nâma_-_rūpapariccheda ñâna_ to _sammâditthi_ are admonished by the Buddha himself, the _lokiyavipassanâsammâditthi_ and _lokuttaramaggasammâditthi_ are together expatiated as the _sammâditthi_ (_Sam_.-_Ttha_.-2: 32; _Sam_.-_Tî_.-2: 38).

Therefore, in this Suttana from aspect of _sakkha_ — **\*sakkho**ti puthujjanakalayâna-\*

_kena saddham satta ariyâ tisso sikkhâ sikkhanti sikkhâ_ (_Abhi_.-_Ttha_.-2: 315).— In accor- dance with the opening of this _kalayânaputhujjana_ and the seven lower _ariyâ_ individuals should be called _sakkha_ individuals who are still practicing the three features of _sikkhâ_ called _sîla_, _samâdhi_ and _paññâ_. Because of this, it should be noted, _kalayânaputhujana_ individual, endowed with _vipassanâsammâditthi ñâna_ vision, is also included among the _sikkha_ individuals.

` `In this _suttana_ the Buddha himself has stated that the _kalayânaputhujjana_ toge- ther with _sikkhâariyâ_ indivuals penetratively understand, by means of **_aparappaccaya ñâna_** = **_attapaccakkha ñâna_**, the process of arising of the _sankhâraloka_, called _lokasamudaya_, and of cessation of _sankhâraloka_, called _lokanirodha_. Similarly the disciples have admitted to each other, during discussion on the _lokasamudaya_ and _lokanirodha_, that they understand these processes penetratively. These are mentioned in the _pitakas_ clearly. Now some extracts from _kosambisuttan_ will be presented.

**Extracts from _Kosambisuttan_**

Once the venerable Musila, Pavittha, Nârada, Ãnandâ were whiling at the _Ghositâ_ monastry in the country of _Kosambi_. Then the venerable Pavittha put some questions to the venerable Musila. The venerable Musila duely answered the questions. The questions and answers are as follows.

_Aññattareva âvuso pavittha saddhâya aññattara ruciyâ aññattara anussavâ aññattara âkâraparivitakkâ aññattara ditthinijjhânakhantiyâ atthâyassamato musilassa paccattameva ñânam_ “_jâtipaccayâ jarâmaranan_”_ti_.

_Aññattareva âvuso musila saddhâya aññattara ruciyâ aññattara anussavâ aññattara âkâraparivitakkâ aññattara ditthinijjhânakhantiyâ ahametam jânâm ahametam passâmi_ “_jâtipaccayâ jarâmaranan_”_ti_ (_Sam_.-1.: 336).

_Thero pana pañcapi etâni kâranâni patikkhapitvâ paccakkhañânena patividdhbhâvum pucchanto **aññattareva âvuso musila saddhâyâ**tiâdomâha_ (_Sam.-Ttha_.-2: 113).

**Question** — My Lord Musila ….

1. _Saddhâ_ = belief in others,
1. _Ruci_ = One’s own confidence born out of self thinking,
1. _Anussava_ = reasonable knowledge obtained from others,
1. _Ãkâparivitakka_ = careful considerable on the characters,
1. _Ditthinijjhânakkhanti_ = devotion towards the tought acquired just by thinking.

Is there **_paccakkhaññâna_** that understands the fact that because of _jâti_ as the cause, except the above five, _jarâmarana_ arises?

**Answer** — My Lord Pavittha ….

1. _Saddhâ_ = belief in others,
1. _Ruci_ = One’s own confidence born out of self thinking,
1. _Anussava_ = reasonable knowledge obtained from others,
1. _Ãkâparivitakka_ = careful considerable on the characters,
1. _Ditthinijjhânakkhanti_ = devotion towards the tought acquired just by thinking.

Yes I know there is **_paccakkhaññâna_** that understands the fact that because of _jâti_ as the cause, except the above five, _jarâmarana_ arises (_Sam_.-1: 336-337).

Upto arising of _sankhâra_ _dhammas_ due to _avijjâ_ were asked similarly, and the answers were made similarly. Again the process of cessation of _sankhâra dhamma_ was asked.

_Aññattareva âvusso musila saddhâya aññattara ruciyâ aññattara anussavâ aññattara âkâraparivitakkâ aññattara ditthinijjhânakkhantiyâ atthâyassamato musilassa paccattameva ñânam_ “_jâtinirodhâ jarâmarananirodho_”_ti_. _Ãññattareva âvusso pavittha saddhâya aññattara ruciyâ aññattara anussavâ aññattara âkâraparivitakkâ aññattara ditthinijjhânakkhantiyâ ahametam jânâmi ahametam passâmi_ “_jâtinirodhâ jarâmarananirodho_”_ti_ (_Sam_.1: 337).

Question — My Lord Musila ….

1. _Saddhâ_ = belief in others,
1. _Ruci_ = One’s own confidence born out of self thinking,
1. _Anussava_ = reasonable knowledge obtained from others,
1. _Ãkâparivitakka_ = careful considerable on the characters,
1. _Ditthinijjhânakkhanti_ = devotion towards the tought acquired just by thinking

Is there **_paccakkhaññâna_** that understands the fact that because the _jâti_ ceases (by way of _anuppâdanirodha dhamma_), with the exception of the above five, _jarâmarana_ ceases (by way of _anuppâdanirodha dhamma_)?

**Answer** — My Lord Pavittha ….

1. _Saddhâ_ = belief in others,
1. _Ruci_ = One’s own confidence born out of self thinking,
1. _Anussava_ = reasonable knowledge obtained from others,
1. _Ãkâparivitakka_ = careful considerable on the characters,
1. _Ditthinijjhânakkhanti_ = devotion towards the tought acquired just by thinking.

Yes I know that there is **_paccakkhaññâna_** that understands the fact that because the _jâti_ ceases (by way of _anuppâdanirodha dhamma_), with exception of the above five, _jarâmarana_ ceases (by way of _anuppâdanirodha dhamma_). (_Sam_.1: 337).

Up to cessation of _avijjâ_ and of _sankhâra_ _dhammas_ were asked similarly, and the answers were made similarly. Here explanations contained in the _atthakathâ tîkâ_ will be presented in continuation.

1. **_Saddhâ_** – some people believe in what others said, and would repeat what he has

heard. He takes it as the truth. The he is the one who is dependent upon others, his knowledge is that of other’s, and, in a way, he ends up at other’s mouth. He is the kind of person without analyzing capability.

2. **_Ruci_** – the other kind of person is the one who thinks about something by himself.

He would think to his liking as “this will arise by itself, not due to other factors.” He would not rely on others with regard to this and would take it to his heart’s liking and as the truth.

3. **_Anussava_** – still the other kind of person would ask “How does this factor arise?

Why does this arise? This factor arises in this way; this factor arises because of this cause.—He would have heard it this way from predecessors. It has been heard so since a long time ago. This is the truth. This factor is just the right one”. What he has heard from others is taken to be true. He is another kind of person who ends up at other’s mouth.

4. **_Ãkâraparivitakka_** – while thinking as this factor may have arisen this way, a factor

he has thought appear in his citta for every material. He is the fourth kind of person who would take into his mind as if what he has thought really exists and is the truth. This is the person without practical experience, who has come to a dead end by just thinking.

5. **_Ditthinicchânakkhanti_** – a fifth kind of person is the one who is considering on a

causative factor, and a certain result occurs while doing so. He firmly believes in it, and takes to heart of the fact that there is no other result. In such a person a kind of firm and determined belief, called _abhinivesa_, occurs. In his thought, concentrated on this cause, a kind of contendment and satisfaction appears. This person will willingly accept – “This cause really exists”, just by thought. This is the\*\* _Ditthinicchânakkhanti_ (_Sam_.-_Ttha_.-2:122; _Sam_.-_Tî_.-2: 122).

It has been asked if the process of arising of _sankhâraloka_ called _lokasamudaya_ = _anulomapaticcasamuppâda dhamma_ and of the dissolution of _sankhâraloka_ called the _lokanirodha_ = _anulomapaticcasamuppâda dhamma_ are understood and visualized by means of _paccakkha ñâna_, after eradicating the the five causes such as _saddhâ_, _ruci_, _anussava_, _âkâparivitakka_ and _ditthinicchânakkhanti_.

The reply was that the process of the arising and dissolution of the _sankhâraloka_ has been understood and visualized by the _paccakkha ñâna_ only, but not with these five causes. In accordance with the _desanâ_ – _purimakammabhavassamim moho avijjâ_ – admonished in the 12 characters of _paticca samuppâda_, page (50) of Patisambhidâmagga pâli in which the Venerable Musila has admittedly stated to have understood and visualized by means of **_paccakkha ñâna_**, the three periods are included as

1. _Dhamma_ groups of the past period referred to as _avijjâ_, _sankhâra_,
1. The present period extending from _viññâ_ to (_kamma_) _bhava_,
1. _Dhamma_ groups of the future period referred to as _jâti_, _jarâmarana_.

Because of the inclusion of these three periods, you may called these characters of the _paticca samuppâda_ also as the _dhammas_ of past, future and present periods; or in accordance with the _desanâ_ mentioned in Patisambhidâmagga pâli, on page (52) as – _jâta avijjâ paccuppanna_ – all can be regarded as solely _paccuppanna dhamma_. Whichever way it is regarded –

1. In _vipassanâ_ prior to _ariyamagga_ called _pubbabhâgasatipatthânamagga_,
1. At the moment of _ariyamagga_,

A meditator must try to visualize these 12 characters of _paticca samuppâda_ by the knowledge of _paccakkha ñâna_ variously admonished as _anubodhañâna_, _pativedhañâna_, _ñâtapariññâ_, _tîranapariññâ_, _pahânapariññâ_, _vipassanâsammâditthi_, _maggasammâditthi_, _aparapaccayañâna_, _attapaccakkhañâna_, etc. As a man would see different _rūpa_ objects via his physical eyes, so should a meditator make attempt at understanding and visualizing these 12 characters penetratively. The Buddha has admonished that only understanding and visualizing this way can one acquire _ariyamagga_ where all _asâva dhammas_ have been utterly eradicated (Sam.-1: 267). Only after penetratively understanding this way, should one discern on the past and future, which are _adittha_, in the same way.

**Be Considerate and Ponder**

_Yam kiñci râhula rūpam atîtânâgatapaccuppanam ijjhattam vâ bahiddhâ vâ olârikam vâ sukhumam vâ hînam vâ panîtam vâ yam dūre vâ santike vâ_, _sabbam rūpam_ “_netam mama_, _nesohamassami_, _na meso attâ_”_ti evummetam yathâbhūtam sammappaññâya passati_ (_Sam_.-1: 444; _Anusayasutta_).

**\*Sammappaññâya passatî**ti saha vipassanâya maggapaññâya sutthu passati* (*Sam*.-*Ttha\*.- 2: 197).

In this Suttana the Buddha has instructed Rahulâ to discern the five-fold _upâdâ_- _nakkhandhâ_, existing as 11 species situated within the past, future and present periods, and in the two _santâna_ of _ijjhatta_ and _bahiddha_ – “_netam mama_, _nesohamassami_, _na meso attâ_” = as _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ unerringly by virtue of **_sammappaññâ_**. Discern with **_sammappaññâ_**, as explained in the _atthakathâ_, means to discern by _vipassanâ paññâ_ together with _ariyamagga paññâ_ so as to visualize thoroughly.

With reference to this explanation note that the **_sammappaññâ_ = good and true knowledge** means the _vipassanâ paññâ_ and _ariyamagga paññâ_. Discern with _vipassanâ paññâ_, and also with the _ariyamagga paññâ_ on the five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_ of the past, future and present periods as _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_. In this discerning are the _vipassanâ paññâ_ and _ariyamagga paññâ_ the _anvaya ñâna_ or _paccakkha ñâna_? The _sayâdaw_ has explained in the book of meaning as follows.

**_Samma_**. **R**. **\*Passatî**ti\* _pubbabhâge vipassanâñânena sammasanavasena_, _mag-gakkhane abhisamayavasena sutthu attapaccakkhkena passat_ (_Sam_.-_Tî_.-2: 181).

In _vipassanâ_ prior to _ariyamagga_ the past and future five-fold *upâdânakkhandhâ*s are well discerned by **_attapaccakkha ñâna_**, called the _sammâditthi ñâna_, which arose by the power of knowledge acquired through the discernment of these five-fold _khandhâs_ as the object. During the _ariyamagga_ stage, the past and future five-fold *upâdânak- khandhâ*s are well discerned by **_attapaccakkha ñâna_,** called the _sammâditthi ñâna_, which arose by the power of knowledge acquired through concentrating on these five-fold *khandhâ*s via _asamohapativedha_ that annihilates the _moha_ hindering the understanding of these *khandhâ*s.

The _vipassanâditthi ñâna_, which can discern on the past and future five-fold _upâ-_

*dânakkhadhâ*s taking them as the object of concentration, is called **_attapaccakkha ñâna_**. In the same way _maggasammâditthi ñâna_ has also been given as **_attapaccakkha ñâna_.** This explanation was given the Reverend Dhammapâva known by the name of Ãcariya Dhammapâla.

_Atha kho rūpâni viya cakkhuviññânena rūpâdîni tesam ca samudayâdike paccakkha katvâ dassanam …_ (_Sam_.-_Tî_.-2: 63).

**\*Avijjâsamudayâ**ti avijjâya uppâdâ*, *atthibhâvâti attho*. *Nirodhavirodhî hi atthibhâvo hoti*, *tassamâ nirodhe asati atthibhâvo hoti*, *tassamâ purimabhavasiddhâya avijjâya sati imassamim bhave rūpassa samudayo rūpassa uppâdo hotîti attho\*. **\*Tahnâsamudayo kammasamudayo**ti itthâpi eseva nayo* (*Sam*.-*Tî\*.-2: 58).

**\*Avijjânirodhâ rūpanirodho**ti aggamaggañânena avijjâya anuppâdanirodhato anâgatassa rūpassa anuppâdanirodho hoti paccayâbhâve abhâvato* (*Sam*.-*Tî*.-2: 59; *Mahâtî\*.-2: 421).

It was also the Reverend Dhammapâva known by the name of Ãcariya Dhammapâla who has explained that as a man could see the _rūpa_ objects by _cakkhuviñ- ñâna_, so should the following be seen penetratively by a meditator see the nature of the _samudaya_ and _nirodha_ = (_attanñgama_) —

1. The five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_ existing in 11 features as the past, future, present, _ijjhatta_, _bahiddha_, _olârika_, _sukhuma_, _hîna_, _panîta_, _dūra_, _santika_,
2. (a) The nature of the _samudaya_ of the present five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_ of five- fold _patisandhekhandhâ_ etc. due to arising of the causes such as _avijjâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, _sankhâra_, _kamma_ etc. of the past _bhava_, which had been cultivated during the establishment of the _kammabhava_; (b) the nature of the _samudaya_ of the future five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_ of five-fold _patisandhekhandhâ_ etc. due to arising of the causes such as _avijjâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, _sankhâra_, _kamma_ etc. of the present _bhava_, which had been cultivated during the establishment of the _kammabhava_, (c) the nature of the _samudaya_, referred to as _nibbattilakkhanâ_, of initial arising of these *upâdânakkhandhâ*s
3. (a) Cessation, without reappearance once again, due to _arahatta magga_ of causes such as _avijjâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, _kamma_ etc. called the nature of _anupâdanirodha_ because of which when *upâdânakkhandhâ*s, the future results, pass away by non- reappearble cessation, referred to as cessation by nature of _anupâdanirodha_ = the nature of _nirodha_ = _atthañgama_, (c) the perishing of these *upâdânakkhandha*s called _bhañga_ = the nature of _nirodha_ and _atthañgama_.

_Naydassanavasena vâ evum vuttam_. _Patthamahñi paccuppannadhammânam udayabbayam disvâ atha atîtânâgate nayam neti_ (_Mahâ_.-_Tî_,-2: 423).

In other words, it is explained as the _nayadassana_ = by virtue of demonstrating the method. To begin with, of the _paccuppanna dhamma_,

` `1 (a) The nature of the _samudaya_ of the present five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_ of five- fold _patisandhekhandhâ_ etc. due to arising of the causes such as _avijjâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, _sankhâra_, _kamma_ etc. of the past _bhava_, which had been cultivated during the establishment of the _kammabhava_; (b) the nature of the _udaya_ of the future five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_ of five-fold _patisandhekhandhâ_ etc. due to arising of the causes such as _avijjâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, _sankhâra_, _kamma_ etc. of the present _bhava_, which had been cultivated during the establishment of the _kammabhava_, (c) because of cessation of the causes such as _avijjâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, _sankhâra_, _kamma_ by means of _anuppâdha_ due to the _ariyamagga_, the future results like _upâdânakkhandhâs_ they pass away by the nature of _anuppâdanirodha_. This nature of this passing away, called the nature of vaya, can be visualized by **_paccayato udayabbayadassana_**;

\2. The **_khanato udayabbayadassana_** which can discern the momentary arising and

perishing away of (the causes) the resultant *upâdânakkhandhâ*s;

` `It has been instructed by the very Mahâtîkâ Sayâdaw the Venerable Dhammapâla that only after discerning on these two kinds of _udayabbaya_ by the _paccakkha ñâna_ concentrate on those of the past and future, which are _adittha_, in a similar way.

It must be remembered that the teacher of the book of meaning never has indicated to discern on the past and future factors not via _paccakkhna ñâna_ but by speculation. And those in search of eternal peace, the _nibbâna_, should always keep that in mind.

**The Noblest Speech**

_Yam Buddho bhâsate vâcam_, _khemam nibbânapattiyâ_. _Dukkhassantakariyâya_, _sâ ve vâcânamuttamâ_ (_Sam_.-1: 191).

_Buddho_ = the Buddha who has understood the Four Noble Truth penetratively, without help of teachers, but by his own knowledge called _sayambhū ñâna_, and so named because he has made the celestial beings, the worldling, the byahmâ and all the sentient beings to penetratively understand the Four Noble Truth via the _paccaknakha ñâna_. _Nibbânapattiyâ_ = to take the great _asankhata_ element, the element of peacefulness, the _nibbâna dhamma_, which would bring an end to the suffering of the worldly affairs, as the object and concentrate by means of _paccakkha ñâna_. _Dukkhassa_ = _vattadukkha_ in the three lives and three planes belonging to three stages of being (e.g. _kâma_, _rūpa_, _arūpa_ existences). _Antakiriyâya_ = for attaining the ending by cessation of _dukkha_ via passing away of the corporeality. _Khemam_ = that which is the attainment of peace and end of the multitude of sufferings. _Yam vâcam_ = that _dhamma_ talk, which should be taken as good _niyânika dhamma_, that helps one escape from _samsarâvatta_. _Bhâsate_ = has admonished with _karunâ_ and _mettâ_. _Sâ vâcâ_ = that _dhamma_ talk which is the _niyânika dhamma_ that lead one to escape from the _samsarâvatta_ is. _Vâcânam_ = of all the talks. _Uttamâ_ = the most superior and noblest of all (_Sam_.-1: 191; _Sam_.-_Ttha_.-2: 252).

These descriptions will suffice to conclude the treatment on **_Paccakkha ñâna_** **and** **_Anvaya ñâna_**. If the explanations given here is acccepted without reservation, then you the noble man is expected to also accept the explanations on Baddekarattasuttana.

**_Bhaddekaratta_ (An Auspicious Night) _Suttana_ – Explanation**

In **_Uparipan_**..**_n_** **_âsapâli vibhañga_**, included in _Mijjhimanikâya_ of the five sections of _nikâya_, four *suttana*s come under the name of **_bhaddekaratta_** = **an auspicious night**. The first _bhaddekaratta suttana_ is _sammâsambuddhabhâsita suttana_ admonished by the Buddha, the _sabbaññu sammâsammâbuddha_ himself.

The second _suttana_ is one admonished by the Venerable Ãnandâ himself. The third _suttana_ was admonished by the Venerable Mahâpaccé.

The fourth was _sammâsammâbuddhabhâsita suttana_ which came into being in relation to the Venerable Lomasakañgiya.

The meaning of \*bhaddekaratta**\* has been** given as **_baddekaratta_** = **an auspicious night**, the explanation being given with reference of method of the five-fold *khandha*s in the first, second and fourth *suttana*s. In the third _suttana_ it was given with reference to the method of 12 species _âyatana_.

In these *suttana*s the monks, who are exercising the _vipassanâbhâvanâkammat_- _thâna_ day and night on the five-fold _khandhâ_ and causes within the two *santâna*s referred to as _ijjhatta_ and _bahiddha_, the three periods the past, future and present or the 12 species of _âyatana_, are expatiated to be **monks of an auspicious night**, and the **night to be of an auspicious night**. The meditation was made to attain _khanapaccuppanna_ by means of

_aniccânupassanâ_ etc. of the seven species of _nupassanâ_.

If you, as a meditator, also wanted to be **a meditating individual of an auspi- cious** **night,** you must** exercise** the _vipassanâbhâvanâkammatthâna_ on the causes of the three periods and within two *santâna*s together with the five-fold _khandhâ_ by means of the _aniccânupassanâ_ etc. of the seven species of _nupassanâ_. In this doctrine, explanations will be made as to how to become a monk of **an auspicious night**, orientating towards understanding the five-fold _khandhâ_ = 12 species of _âyatana_ = _rūpa_- _nâma dhamma_ penetratively understood by three _pariññâ_. To acquire this penetrative knowledge, a step by step elucidation will be made of the exercise on \*vipassanâ bhâvanâ**_ from _**ânâpâna* way\*\* to the attainment of *arahattaphala\*.

Among the _Baddekaratta suttanas_, four *gâthâ*s are given in brief, and their meanings are g1iv. e n\* *A*in*t* *î*c*t*._a_ o*m*n..t* i*n*n*â*.u *n*a*v*ti*â*o*g*n*a*.. *m* T*e*.h *y*e*a* ,f o*n*. u*a*r*p\* *pgaâttihkâa*s*ñ* a*k*r*h*e*e\*\* a*a*s*n* f*â*o*g*l.l*a*o *t*.w*a* .*m\* .. .

4. _Evum vihâram âtâpam_, _ahorattamatanditam_.

_Tam ve_ “_baddekaratto_”_ti_, _santo âcakkhate muni_.

The meaning of the above *gâthâ*s are as follows.

` `1 (a). As the past five-fold _khandhâ_ have perished utterly, the past five-fold *khandhâ*s

(= the 12 _âyatana_) should not be clung to by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ as “I, mine”.

(b) As the future five-fold *khandhâ*s have not yet attained, and so have not arisen, the future five-fold *khandhâ*s should not be anticipated by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ as “I, mine”.

2. The man of wisdom should discern on the present five-fold *khandhâ*s

1) at that moment of arising
1) at that _dhamma_ groups
1) at site of forest etc., by means of _aniccânupassanâ_ etc. of the seven kinds of _nupassanâ_. The man of wisdom should be recollecting on the indestructible _vipassanâ ñâna_ to which no _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ attached as “I, mine”. In other words to enter a _janic_ state of _asankhata dhâtu_, element of peacefulness, the _nibbâna_ and _phalasammâpatta_ by the recollecting on these which have not been destroyed and

` `with no attached _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ as “I, mine”.

3. For the purpose exercise by the recollecting _vipassanâ ñâna_ or for exercise by recollection on the _phalasamâpatta_, which is associated with _samattha vipassanâ_ that is able to annihilate *kilesâ*s, effort must be made without procrastination. For no body knows if one would be still alive tomorrow or a day after. Indeed we never have any

agreement with the king of death regarding when to die.

4. The monk, who leads his life making every effort to acquire _phalasamâpatta_, that is associated with _samattha vipassanâ_ that is can annihilate the *kilesâ*s, is, in fact, **one who belongs to an auspicious night**. This was expatiated by the _Sabbaññu Sammâsambuddha Buddha_ named _Buddhamuni_ the Supreme of the *muni*s in

` `whom the *kilesâ*s have utterly been eradicated (_Ma_.-3: 226).

**Delight in the Past**

In accordance with instruction given in the above _gâthâ_ (1) _atîtam nânvâgameya_

-   the past is not to be followed.

_viññâno ahosim atîtamaddhân_._a_ ”_ti attha nandim samanvâneti_. _Evum kho bhikkhave atîtam anvâgamaneti_ (_Ma_.-3: 226).

-   .

**\*Attha nandim samanvâdhnatî**ti tesu rūpâdîsu tahnam samanvâneti anupavatteti* (*Ma*.- *T*..*t\* _ha_.-4: 171).

Bhikkhus …. How is the past enjoyed?

1. Delight in the past _rūpa dhamma_, the _nandî dhamma_, as **–** “The _rūpa_ _dhamma_ has arisen in the past” **–** has appeared.
1. “Such a feeling = _vedanâ dhamma_ in the past,
1. Such an awareness = _saññâ dhamma_,
1. Such a dynamic groups of _cetasika sankhâra dhammas_,
1. Such a mental quality = _viññâna dhamma_ has arisen.” will cause the formation of delight in the past (_vedanâ_-_saññâ_-_sankhâra_) _viññâna dhammas_. Bhikkhus …. The

` `past is enjoyed in this way (_Ma_. 3: 226).

If the delight, _nandî dhammas_,* in the *rūpa*-*vedanâ*-*saññâ*-*sankhâra*-*viññâna\* of the past resulted as expounded above by the Buddha, then there always is enjoyment in the past. This is what it really means and which must be well noted. Again the Venenrable Mahâkaccé also has explained how to have enjoyment in the past as given below. .

_Kathañca âvuso atîtam_. _anvâga_._m_ _eti? Iti me ca_. _kkhu ahosi atîtamaddhânam_, _iti rūpâti_, _tattha sandarâgappatibaddham hoti viññânam_, _sandarâgappatibaddhattâ viññânassa_

**.**

_tadabhisandati_, _tadabhinadanto atîtam anvâgameti_ (_Ma_.-3: 236).

My colleagues …. In what ways is the past always enjoyed?

The _nikanti viññâna_ associated with longing for element of eye clearness and in material object, the _chandharâga_, had arisen such as in the past I have had element of eye clearness in this way, my material objects have been this way. Because of association of this conscious (_nikanti_) _viññâna dhamma_ with the clinging, _râgasandha_, one is delighted in the element of eye clearness and material object. If one is delighted with the element of eye clearness and material object, then he is delighted in the past. (It has been expatia- ted that the same applies to the remaining *âyatana*s).
