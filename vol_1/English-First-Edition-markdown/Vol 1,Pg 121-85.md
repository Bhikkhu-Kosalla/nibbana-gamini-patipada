In the above sermon too the instruction is that it must be kept firmly in mind that if delight has been attached to 12 species of _âyatana_, then the past is delighted in.

How the Past is Not Enjoyed

_nandim na sa_. _manvâneti_. “_Evum vedano_. R. ._E_ ._v_ _um_. _sañño_.. _Evum_. _san_._k_ _hâro_. _Evum_. _Kathañca Bhikkhave atîtam_. _nânvâgameti_, “_evum rūpo ahosim atîtamaddhânan_”_ti tattha_

_viññâno ahosim atîtamaddh_._â_ _nan_”_ti tattha nandim na samnvâneti_. _Evum kho bhikkhave atîtam nâmanvâgameti_ (_Ma_.-3: 226 – 227).

` `Bhikkhave …. In what way was the past not enjoyed?

1. Delight in the past _rūpa dhamma_, the _nandî dhamma_, as **–** “The _rūpa_ _dhamma_ has arisen in the past” **–** has not appeared.
1. “Such a feeling = _vedanâ dhamma_ in the past,
1. Such an awareness = _saññâ dhamma_,
1. Such a dynamic groups of _cetasika sankhâra dhammas_,
1. Such a mental quality = _viññâna dhamma_” will cause the formation of delight in the past (_vedanâ_-_saññâ_-_sankhâra_), _viññâna dhammas_ has not arisen. Bhikkhus ….

` `This is how the past is not enjoyed (_Ma_.3: 236).

The Venerable Mahâkaccé has also explained how no enjoyment is seeked in the

past.

_Kathañca âvusso atîtam nânvâgameti_.. _Iti me cakkhu ahosi atîtamaddhânam_, _iti rūpâti_, _tattha na sandarâgappatibaddham hoti vuññânam_. , _na s_._a_ _ndarâgappatibaddhattâ_

` `_viññânassa na tadabhinandati_, _na tadabhinandanto atîtam nânvâgameti_ (_Ma_.-3: 236).

My colleagues …. In what ways is the past not always followed?

The _nikanti viññâna_ associated with longing for element of eye clearness and in material object, the _chandharâga_, had not arisen such as in the past I have had element of eye clearness in this way, my material objects have been this way. Because of dissociation of this conscious (_nikanti_) _viññâna dhamma_ with the clinging, _chandharâga_, one is not delighted in the element of eye clearness and material object. If one is not delighted with the element of eye clearness and material object, then he is not delighted in the past (_Ma_.-3: 236).

The same has been instructed to apply to the remaining *âyatana*s. In this sermon, if there is enjoyment in the 12 *âyatana*s, then this means that the past is still enjoyed, and it should be remembered that if there is no enjoyment in the 12 *âyatana*s there will be no delight in the past.

The explanations given by the Buddha and the Venerable Mahâkaccé are that if there has been delight, the _nadîdhamma_, in the five-fold *khandhâ*s, _rūpa_ and _nâma dham_- *ma*s called the 12 *âyatan*s, then the past will be clung to. If *nadîdhamma*s have not arisen then it is clear that there is no pleasure in the past. These are the *desanâ*s which have

instructed with emphasizing only on the exercise to be detached from the past *khandhâ*s and *âyatana*s*.* It should be realized that these *desanâ*s instructed only to be detached, to be free from attachment to, the past *khandhâ*s, *âyatana*s or _tahnâ ditthi_. These, however, do not mean that the past _khandhâ_-_âyatana_-_rūpa_-_nâma_ are not to be taken as the object of meditation.

Expectation of the Future

_Kathañca bhikkhave anâgatam_. _patikañkhati_? _“Evum_. _rūpo siyam_. _anâgatamaddhânan_”_ti_

-   . . . . .

_tattha nandi_._m_ _samanvâneti_. _Evum vedano siyam_.. R. _Evum sañño s_._i_ _yam_. “_Evum viññâno siyam anâatamaddhânan_._”_ _ti tattha nandim samnvâneti_. _Evum kho bhikkhave anâgatam patikañkhati_ (_MA_.-3: 227).

Bhikkhave …. How is the future expected?

1. Delight in the future _rūpa dhamma_, the _nandî dhamma_, as **–** “The _rūpa_ _dhamma_ is anticipated to arise in the future.”
1. This kind of feeling in future = _vedanâ dhamma_. R.
1. Such an awareness = _saññâ dhamma_.
1. _Cetasika sankhâra dhamma_ which are subject to such changes.
1. Such a consciousness = delight, *nandî dhamma*s, in the future *viññâna dhamma\*\* (*vedanâ*-*saññâ*-*sankhâra\*) results when a wish is made for them.

` `Bhikkhus …. The longing for the future has been made in this way.

` `This is what the Buddha has expounded with regard to longing for the future. Again the Venerable Mahâkaccé has expatiated on the anticipation of the future in the following way.

-   .

_Kathañca âvusso anâgatam patikañkhati_.. _Iti me cakkhu siyâ anâgatamaddhânam_, _iti rūpâti appatiladdhassa patilâbhâya cittam panidahati_, _c_. _etaso panidhânapaccayâ tada- nadati_, _tadabhinandati_, _tadabhinandanto anâgatam patikañkhati_ (_Ma_.-3:237).

My colleagues …. In what way is the past longed for? May the element of my eye clearness be so in future; may my corporeality be so. The mind has been set in this way on the eye clearness element and corporeality which have yet to acquire. The mind set in this way is the cause due which the awareness in the eye clearness element and corporeality have resulted. If there is delight in this eye clearness element and corporeality, then will be anticipation for the future. (It has been admonished that the same applies to the remaining *âyatana*s) (_Ma_.-3:237).

According to the _desanâ_ admonished here —

If a wish has been made in mind that in the future period and future life as to be a human of good deeds, a god of good deeds, and had made wishes after performance of _kusala_ actions, then this means there is delight in the five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_ of the human and of the god. Note that if there is enjoyment for these, then there is anticipation for the future.

**Not Anticipating the Future**

_Kathañca bhikkhave anâgatam nappatikañkhati_. “_Evum rūpo siyam anâgatamaddhâ- nan_”_ti tattha nandim na samanvâneti_. _Evum vedano siyam_. R. _Evum sañño siyam_. _Evum sankhâro siyam_. “_Evum viññâno siyam anâgatamaddhânan_”_ti tattha nandim na samanvâneti_. _Evum kho bhikkhave anâgatam nappatikañkhati_(_Ma_.-3:227).

Bikkhave …. In what way is the future not anticipated?

Enjoyment, _nandî dhamma_, in the future corporeality as “I wish to have a human good looking material body in future” does not happen to arise in one again and again.

Such an enjoyable feeling = wish to be one with _vedanâ_. R.

Such an awareness = wish to be one with _saññâ_.

Wish to be one with such a _cetasika_ and _sankhâra dhamma_ groups subject to change.

“Wish to be one with such an enjoyable consciousness = _viññâna_ in future”, a delight in these future\* _viññâna dhamma_ (_vedanâ_-_saññâ_-_sankhâra_) groups have not been made again and again.

Bhikkhus …. This how the future has not been anticipated (_Ma_.-3: 227).

This is the _desanâ_ expatiated by the Buddha, through his _mukhapâttha_, as an explanation of how the future is not anticipated. With regard to non-anticipation of the future, the Venerable Mahâkaccé has given the following explanation.

_Kathañca âvusso anâgatam nappatikañkhati_. _Iti me cakkhu siyâ anâgatamaddhânam_, _iti rūpâti appatiladdhassa patilâbhâya cittam nappanidahati_. _Cetaso appanidhânapaccayâ na tadabhinadati_, _na tadabhinandanto anâgatam nappatikañkhati_ (_Ma_.-3: 237).

My colleagues …. In what way is the future not anticipated? The mind is not set on the eye clearness element not yet acquired as I wish my future eye clearness element be this way, material objects be like this. Because of the non-committed mind as the cause, there is no enjoyment in the future eye clearness element and material object. If there is no delight in the future eye clearness element and material object, then the future will not be longed for or anticipated. (A similar explanation was expatiated for the remaining five pairs of *âyatana*s). (_Ma_.-3: 237).

Note again that with reference to the above _desanâ_ expounded by the Omniscient Buddha and the explanations given by the Venerable Mahâkaccé, no longing for nor delight in the future five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_ and the _rūpa_-_nâma_, called the twelve *âyatana*s, as “Let me be it,” means no anticipation on the future.

With regard to the above explanations and instructions, teacher of the book of meaning also has the given meaning of “**do not long for future**, **do not anticipate the future**” as follows.

**\*Atîta**nti atîte pañcakkhandhe\*. **\*Nânvâgameyâ**ti tahnâditthîhi nânugaccheya\*.

**\*Napatikañkhe**ti tahnâditthihi na pattheya* (*Ma*.-*Ttha\*.4: 170).

` `The past refers to the five-fold _khandhâ_ of the past (= 12 species of _âyatana_); do not long for the past means not to long for the past five-fold _khandhâ_ (= the _âyatana_ 12 species) by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ as “I **–** **Mine = Let me be like this. Let me be like this**”**.**

Do not anticipate for the future means not to long for the future five-fold _khandhâ_ (= _âyatana_ 12 species) by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ as “**I would like to be this. I would like to be this.**”

**The Essence of the Sermon**

The actual sense of this pâli book of meaning is this.

1. If attachment is made on the past five-fold _khandhâ_ by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_, then it is longing for the past.
1. If attachment is not made on past five-fold _khandhâ_ by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_, then means that the past is not longed for.
1. If attachment is made on the future five-fold _khandhâ_ by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_, then it is longing for the future.
1. If attachment is not made on future five-fold _khandhâ_ by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_, then means that the future is not longed for.

This is the basic idea of the statement.

1. Do not to long for the past means to meditate so as not be attached on the past five- fold _khandhâ_ by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ and effort must be made not be so attached.
1. Do not to long for the future means to meditate so as not be attached on the future five-fold _khandhâ_ by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ and effort must be made not be so attached.

` `It should be accepted without reservation that this is what the _desanâ_ really means.

**Attraction to _Tahnâ_-_Ditthi_ in the Present**

The Buddha Sabbñusammâsambuddha himself has expatiated as if there is _sakkâya ditthi_ referred to as _attaditthi_ = my life, my soul, my _viññâna_ and my self, attached either on the present five-fold _khandhâ_ or on any one of these five, and if there is attachment as I, other, male, female, individuality, sentient being, human, god, _byahmâ_, then attraction will be exerted on the five-fold _khandhâ_ by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ (_Ma_,-3: 227).

Bhikkhus …. In what way is attraction made on the present by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_?

Bhikkhus …. In this world, worldlings, who are not used to seeing the *ariya*s, being incompetent in and unfamiliar with the _ariyâdhamma_, and not used to seeing the people of good deeds being incompetent in, unfamiliar with, and unheard of the good _dhamma_, are being attracted by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ in the following way.

1. _Rūpa_ is discerned as _atta_.
1. (The remaining *khandhâ*s) Are discerned as possessing _atta_,
1. Discerning as _rūpa_ in _atta_ and
1. _Atta_ in _rūpa_.

Feeling as _vedanâ_ is. R.

` `Awareness as saññâ is. R.

` `_Cetasika sankhâra dhamma_ groups subject to change as. R.

1. Awareness = discern _viññâna_ as _atta_.
1. (The remaining *khandhâ*s) Are discerned as possessing _atta_.
1. Discerning as _rūpa_ in _atta_ and
1. _Atta_ in _rūpa_.

` `Bhikkhus …. In this way attraction is made to the present *dhamma*s by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ (_Ma_.-3: 227).

The Venerable Mahâkaccé too has expounded as follow.

_Kathañca âvusso paccuppannesu dhammesu samhîrati_.

_Yañcâvusso cakkhu_, _ye ca rūpâ_. _Ubhayametam paccuppannam_, _tassamim ce paccuppanne chandarâgappatibaddham hoti viññânam_, _chandarâgappatibadhattâ viññânassa tadabhinandanto paccuppannesu dhammesu samhîrati_ (_Ma_.-3: 237).

My colleagues …. In what way do _thanâ_-_ditthi_ attract as “I, mine” in the present *dhamma*s?

My colleagues …. Eye clearness element (= _cakkhupasâda_) and _rūpa_ object are a pair of the present. Longing for the eye clearness element and _rūpa_ object of the present = awareness connected with _chanda_-_râga_ = _viññâna_ may occur. Then that eye clearness element and _rūpa_ object will be enjoyed because of the awareness = longing of the _viññâna_ = the state of being connected with the _chandarâga_. If there is delight in the eye clearness element and _rūpa_ object, then there is attraction by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ to these present *dhamma*s. (The same phenomenon for the remaining five pairs of *âyatana*s have been expounded).

**Distraction by _Tahnâ_-_Ditthi_ in the Present**

Bhikkhave …. In what way do _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ distract in the present?

Bhikkhus …. In this world, _sâvaka_, the followers of the Buddha’s _desanâ_, who are used to seeing the *ariya*s, being competent in and familiar with the _ariyâdhamma_, and used to seeing the people of good deeds, being competent in, familiar with and having knowledge of the good _dhamma_, are being distracted by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ in the following way.

5. _Rūpa_ is discerned not as _atta_.
6. (The remaining *khandhâ*s) Are discerned as not possessing _atta_,
7. Not discerning as _rūpa_ in _atta_ nor
8. _Atta_ in _rūpa_.

Feeling as _vedanâ_ is. R.

` `Awareness as saññâ is. R.

` `_Cetasika sankhâra dhamma_ groups subject to change as. R.

5. Awareness = discern _viññâna_ not as _atta_.
6. (The remaining *khandhâ*s) Are discerned as not possessing _atta_.
7. Not discerning as _rūpa_ in _atta_ nor
8. _Atta_ in _rūpa_.

` `Bhikkhus …. In this way no attraction is made to the present *dhamma*s by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ (_Ma_.-3: 227).

_Kathañca âvusso paccuppannosu_ _dhammesu na samhîrati_.

_Yañcâvusso cakkhu_, _ubhayametam paccuppannam_, _tassamim ce paccuppanne na chadarâgappatibaddham hoti viññânam_. _Na chandarâgappatibaddhattâ viññânassa na tadabhinandati_, _na tadabhinandanto paccuppannesu dhammesu na samhîrati_ (_Ma_.-3:238).

My colleagues …. In what way is no attraction made to the present *dhamma*s by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_?

My colleagues …. The eye clearness element and the _rūpa_ object are a pair of the present. Suppose the longing for present eye clearness element and _rūpa_ object = awareness associated with _chanda_-_râga_ = _viññâna_ does not arise. Because of the awareness = longing of the _viññâna_ = being dissociated with _chanda_-_râga_ result in

distraction of that eye clearness element and _rūpa_ object. If there is no delight in these two, then there is no attraction to the present *dhamma*s by means of _tahnâ_-_ditthi_. (It has been expatiated that the same applies to remaining five pairs of *âyatana*s).

**The Meaning of the _Desanâ_**

The meaning of the _desanâ_ has been given by the teacher of the book of meaning

as follows.

_Tattha **samhîratî**ti vipassanâya abhâvato tahnâditthîhi âkatthiyati_. **\*Na samhîratî**ti vipassanâya bhâvena tahnâditthîti âkatthiyati* (*Ma*.-*Ttha\*.-4: 171 - 172).

Because _vipassanâ ñâna_ does not arise in the present *dhamma*s = due to the _vipassanâ ñâna_ being not apparent, there is an attraction exerted by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_. Due to arising of the _vipassanâ ñâna_ in the present *dhamma*s, there apparently is _vipassanâ ñâna_ because of which no attraction can be exerted on the present *dhamma*s.\*

(_Ma_.-_Ttha_.- 4: 171 - 172).

In accordance with the explanations given in the above, if _vipassanâ ñâna_ are arising on the present *dhamma*s, there can be no attraction by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ = there can be no _tahnâ_-_ditthi_. If no _vipassanâ ñâna_ arises on the present *dhamma*s, attraction by _tahnâ_- _ditthi_ will be exerted = the _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ will be arising. Therefore, the Buddha himself has instructed in second _gâthâ_ to be free from attraction by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_. So as not to be attached by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ on the present five-fold _khandhâ_ and _rūpanâma_ *dhamma*s must be dissolved and discerned by _vipassanâ_ via _aniccânupassanâ ñâna_, _dukkhânupassanâ ñâna_, _anattânupassanâ ñâna_, _nibbidânupassanâ ñâna_, _virâganupassanâ ñâna_, _nirodhâ- nupassanâ ñâna_, _patinissaggâ ñâna_, referred to as the seven _anupassanâ ñâna_, again and again.

_Paccuppannañca yo dhammam_, _tattha tattha vipassati_.

_Asamhîram asamkuppam_, _tam viddvâ manubayūhaye_.

(The meaning of this stanza is given at the beginning of Baddekaratta suttana).

The explanations have also been given by _atthakathâ_-_tîkâ_ as follows.

**\*Attha tatthâ**ti paccuppannampi dhammam yattha yattheva ca nam aniccânupassanâdîhi sattahi anupassanâhi yo vipassani*, *araññâdîsu vâ tattha tattheva vipassati* (*Ma*.-*Ttha\*.- 4: 170).

**\*Yattha yatthâ**ti yassamim yassamim khane*, *yassamim yassamim vâ dhammapuñje uppannam*, *tam sabbampi asesetvâ* (*a*.-*Tî\*.-3: 366).

The following is what these _atthakathâ_-_tîkâ_ mean.

Concentration is repetitively made on the present five-fold *khandhâ*s as

1. At the moment of arising,
1. In places like forest etc.,
1. Those groups of dhamma, as they are, are entirely discerned by _aniccânupassanâ_ etc. of the seven _anupassanâ ñâna_. The _vipassanâ ñâna_,

concentrating on the object, is never attracted by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ of the *kilesâ*s. This _vipassanâ ñâna_ is indestructible by _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ of the *kilesâ*s. Then the _vipassanâ ñâna_ is again discerned = culture that _vipassanâ ñâna_. Discernment in this way is also discerning on the five-fold _khandhâ_ = _manodvârika mahâkusala jovîthi citta_ led by _vipassanâ ñâna_ in turn is concentrated so that the object of concentration and concentra- ting _ñâna_ as a pair is being discerned.

If _vipassanâ ñâna_ is increased by discerning this way the opposing _kilesâ_ of _raga_ etc. cannot destroy it. A man of wisdom must discern repeatedly on the _vipassanâ ñâna_ which is indestructible by the opposing _kilesâ_ of _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ etc.

This description of indestructibility of _vipassanâ ñâna_ is just a _pariyâya_. As the _vipassanâ ñâna_ can only momentarily eradicate the opposing *kilesa*s, it can remain indes- tructible only momentarily.

In fact it is the _nibbâna dhamma_, named the _asankhata dhâtu_, which certainly remains indestructible by means of the opposing *kilesa*s. Therefore, a man of wisdom must exercise on the _vipassanâ bhâvanâ_ via _vipassanâ ñâna_ to ultimately attain path knowledge and fruit knowledge. Then with the path knowledge so acquired, enter the fruit absorption (_phalsammâpatti_) state repeatedly taking the _asankhata dhâtu_, the element of peacefulness, the _nibbâna_ as the object. This is the meaning the second _gâtha_.

**Instructions Acquired**

If the above two *gâthâ*s are taken in brief, the Buddha has instructed that –

1. Not to have _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ on the past five-fold _khandhâ_,
1. Not to have _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ on the future five-fold _khandhâ_,
1. Not to have _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ on the present five-fold _khandhâ_.

It has also been instructed that the present five-fold _khandhâ_ are repetitively concentrated, not to have _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ on them, by means of _aniccânupassanâ_ etc. of the seven _anupassanâ ñâna_.

If so a question arises as to how to practise in such a way that one has no _tahnâ_- _ditthi_ on the five-fold *khandhâ*s of the past, future and present. The answer for this is as given below.

**Extracts from Patisambhidâmagga Pâli**

_Katham atîtânâgatapaccuppannânam dhammânam sañkhipitvâ vavatthâne paññâ sammane ñânam –_

_Yam kañci rūpam atîtânâgatapaccuppannam acchattam vâ bhahiddhâ vâ olârika vâ sukhumam vâ yam dūre vâ santike vâ_, _sabbam rūpam aniccato vavatthapeti ekam sammasanam_. _Dukkhato vavatthapeti ekam sammanam_, _anattato vavatthapeti ekam_

` `_sammanam._

_Yâ kâci vedanâ_. R. _Yâ kâci saññâ_. _Ye keci sankhârâ_. _Yam kañci viññânam atîtânâgata- paccuppannam ijjhattam vâ bhahiddhâ vâ olârikam vâ sukhumam vâ hînam vâ panîtam_

_vâ yam dūre santike vâ_. _Sabbam viññânam aniccato vavatthapeti ekam sammasanam_. _Dukkho vavatthapeti ekam sammasanam_, _attato vavatthapeti ekam sammasanam_ (_Patisam_.: 51).

Why is the knowledge that can analyze in brief the past, future and present *dhamma*s called the _sammasana ñâna_? The past, the future, the present, _ijjhatta_, _bahiddha_, _olârika_, _sukhuma_, _hîna_, _panîta_, _dūra_, _santika_ which are all *rūpa*s, and individually noted as _anicca_ is an analytical notion = called _sammasana_. Individually noted as _dukkha_ is another analytical notion = called _sammasana_. Individually noted as _anatta_ is still

another analytical notion = called _sammasana_ (_Patisam_.: 51).

_Tasamâ esa yam **atîtam** rūpam_, _tam yasamâ atîteyeva khînam_, _nayimam bhavum sampat- tanti aniccam kayatthena_. _Yam **anâgatam** rūpam anantarabhave nibbattissati_, _na tato param bhavum gamissatîti aniccam khayatthena_. _Yam **paccuppannam** rūpam_, _tampi idheva khîyati_, _na ito gicchatîti aniccam khayatthena_ (_Vi._-2: 245; _Patisam_.-_Ttha_.-1: 229). Therefore, this meditating monk discerns in this way. –

1. A certain **\*atita rūpa** dhamma* did exist that, however, perished away in the past and never reaching the present life. Due to this nature of perishing and dissolving away, it is discerned as *anicca\*.
1. A certain **\*anâgata rūpa** dhamma* will arise in the future that will perish away in the future, but will never continue into next future. Because of this nature of perishing and dissolving away, it is discerned as *anicca\*.
1. A certain **_paccuppanna rūpa_** _dhamma_ does exist that, however, perishes away in the present, but will never continue into another life. Due to this nature of perishing

` `and dissolving away, it is discerned as _anicca_ (_Vi._-2: 245; _Patisam_.-_Ttha_.-1: 229).

[**Note**. It has been expatiated to discern on the *vedanâ*, *saññâ*, *sankhâra*, *viññâna* etc. of the four-fold *nâmakhandhâ*s, the 12 *âyatanas*, 18 *dhâtus* and the 12 characters of *paticca samuppâda* in a way similar to that applied for the *rūpakkhandhâ*. See *Patisam*.: 51-52.]

_Evum sankhâra annatto passantassa **ditthisamugghâtanam** nâma hoti_. _Aniccato passantassa **mânasamugghâtanam** nâma hoti_. _Dukkhato passantassa **nikantipariyâdânam** nâma hoti_. _Iti ayam vipassanâ anattano anattano tthâne yeva titthatîti_ (_Visuddhi_-2:264).

In this way in the _santâna_ of the one who understands the *sankhâra dhamma*s as the _anatta_, **_ditthisamugghâtna_** = distraction from _ditthi_ appears. When one who understands the *sankhâra dhamma*s as the _anicca_, **_mânasamugghâtana_** = distraction from _mâna_ appears. When one who understands the *sankhâra dhamma*s as the _dukkha_, **_nikantipariyâdâna_** = dissolution of _tahnânikanti_ appears. Note that each _vipassanâ_ is related to its corresponding character (_Visuddhi_-2:264).

Here explanation of Mahâtîkâsayâdaw is briefly described. (For detail see Mahâtîkâ vol. II, pp. 415 – 416; Nibbâgâminipatipadâ, vol. V, in section on Sammâ- sana ñâna, pp. 152 – 153).

Although _anattânupassanâ ñâna_ can distract _ditthi_, it is not this _ñâna_ alone which can do so. Only when supported by the force of the _aniccânupassanâ ñâna_ and _dukkânupassanâ ñâna_, based on the powerful _upanissaypaccaya_, the _anattânupassanâ ñâna_ becomes sharp, clean and powerful. Then it can dissociate itself from clinging to the _ditthi_.

Similarly even though _anattânupassanâ ñâna_ can distract clinging to _mâna_, it is not this _ñâna_ alone which can do so. Only when supported by the force of the _aniccânupassanâ ñâna_ and _dukkânupassanâ ñâna_, based on the powerful _upanissaypaccaya_, the _anattânupassanâ ñâna_ becomes sharp, clean and powerful. Then it can dissociate itself from the clinging to the _mâna_.

_Aniccasaññâ bhâvetabbâ asamimânasamugghâtâya_ = the Buddha has instructed that for the sake of detaching from the clinging on to the _asamimâna_, meditate on the _aniccasaññâ_ (_Mahâtî_.-2: 416).

Again although _dukkhânupassanâ ñâna_ can dissolve the _nikanti_,* the clinging to *tahnâ*, it is not this *ñâna* alone which can do so. Only when supported by the force of the *aniccânupassanâ ñâna* and *anattânupassanâ ñâna*, based on the powerful *upanissaypaccaya*, the *dukkhânupassanâ ñâna* becomes sharp, clean and powerful. Then it can dissociate itself from the clinging on to the *tahnâ\*.

Since the clinging to _tahnâ_ cannot be detached by _aniccânupassanâ_ alone nor to _mâna_ by _dukkhânupassanâ_ alone nor to _ditthi_ by _anattânupassanâ_ alone, _vipassanâ_ exercise must be made on each of the three general characters taken alternately as the object. In discerning this way, priority may be given to _aniccalakkhanâ_ if need be. The same applies to _dukkhalakkhanâ_ and _anattalakkhanâ_.

Because of _vipassanâ_ exercise by recollection, the _anattânupassanâ ñâna_ becomes sharper, clearer, more penetrative, effective, accumulated and powerful enough to dissolve the clinging to _atta_ by support of the _aniccânupassanâ ñâna_ and _dukkhânupassanâ ñâna_. Then this _anattânupassanâ_ is powerful enough to demolish the clinging to _attaditthi_.

At a corresponding time the _aniccânupassanâ ñâna_ becomes sharper, clearer, more penetrative, effective, accumulated and powerful enough to dissolve the clinging to _atta_ by support of the _dukkhânupassanâ ñâna_ and _anattânupassanâ_. Then this _aniccânupassanâ ñâna_ is powerful enough to demolish the clinging to _mâna_.

At a corresponding time the _dukkhânupassanâ ñâna_ becomes sharper, clearer, more penetrative, effective, accumulated and powerful enough to dissolve the clinging to _atta_ by support of the _aniccânupassanâ ñâna_ and _anattânupassanâ ñâna_. Then this _dukkhânupassanâ ñâna_ is powerful enough to demolish the clinging to _tahnâ_ (see

_Mahâtî_.-2: 415 – 416).

**The Power of _Lokiyabhâvanâ_**

_Lokiyabhavanâya hi kâye pahînam na vedanâdîsu pahînam hoti_. _Yadipi na pavatteya_, _na **ekattha pahînam sesesupi pahînam hotî**ti maggasatipatthâbhâvanam_, _lokiya- bhâvanâya vâ sabbattha appavattimattam sandhâya vuttam_ (_Ma_.-_Tî_.-1: 347).

The power of _lokuttarâmaggasatipatthânabhâvana_ and that of _lokiyasatipatthâ- nabhâvanâ_ are not similar. As mediator is exercising _vipassanâ_ on the _paramattha_ objects such as _kâya_, _vedanâ_, _ciita, dhamma_ etc.,* along with culturing their causes, he arrives at a stage about to attain the *ariyamagga*. At that instant the meditator can concentrate on any of *kâya*, *vedanâ*, *ciita, dhamma* in the process of *vipassanâ* and still can acquire *ariyamagga*. If *ariyamagga* is attained while concentrating on the *rūpa\* _dhamma_, named _kâya_, then it can disintegrate and annihilate not only the _tahnâ_ and _mâna_ clinging to the _rūpa dhamma_, but the _tahnâ_, _mâna_ and _ditthi_ clinging on to the _vedanâ_, _citta_, and _dhamma_. Remember that the same thing happens in exercising _vipassanâ_ on the _vedanâ_, _citta_, and _dhamma_. The *lokuttara ariyamagga dhamma*s are, however, the dhammas which can arise only when supported by the force of powerful vipassanâ nanas such as _upanissaya_ and _paccayasatti_ bases.

On the other hand, the _lokiyasatipatthâna bhâvanâ_ is not that powerful. If _vipassanâ_ exercise is made on the _rūpa dhamma_, named _kâya_, as the object, then _tahnâ_, _mâna_ and _ditthi_ clung to this _dhamma_ can be dissolved momentarily. This _kâyânupassanâ satipatthâna bhâvanâ_ cannot disintegrate _tahnâ_, _mâna_ and _ditthi_ clung to _vedanâ_, _citta_ and _dhamma_. It must be reminded that a similar situation occurs when discerning on the _vedanâ_, _citta_ and _dhamma_.

Therefore, in the case of _lokiyasatipatthânabhâvanâ_, _vipassanâ_ exercise is made on the _kâya_ so as to dissolve the _tahnâ_, _mâna_ and _ditthi_ clung to the _kâya_. The exercise is made on the _vedanâ_ so as to dissolve the _tahnâ_, _mâna_ and _ditthi_ clung to the _vedanâ_.* The *vipassanâ* exercise is made on the *citta* so as to disintegrate the *tahnâ*, *mâna* and *ditthi* clung to the *citta*.* The _vipassanâ_ exercise is made on the *dhamma*s so as to dissolve the _tahnâ_, _mâna_ and _ditthi_ clung to the _dhamma_.

As a matter of fact, _kâya_, _vedanâ, citta_ and _dhamma_ are the five-fold _upâdânak_- _khandhâ_. So, to annihilate the _tahnâ_, _mâna_ and _ditthi_ clung to the present five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_, meditation is made on the present _upâdâkkhandhâ_ as an object. To annihilate the _tahnâ_, _mâna_ and _ditthi_ clung to the past five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_, meditation is made on the past _upâdâkkhandhâ_ as an object. To annihilate the _tahnâ_, _mâna_ and _ditthi_ going to be clung to the future five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_, meditation is made on the future _upâdâkkhandhâ_ as an object. This the method of practicing for eradication of the _tahnâ_, _mâna_ and _ditthi_ clinging to the past, future and present five- fold *upâdânakkhandhâ*s.

Therefore the following instructions are achieved from the above.

1. To be free from _tahâ_-_ditthi_ attached to present five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_ the _vipassanâ_ exercise is made on present five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_.
1. To be free from _tahâ_-_ditthi_ attached to past five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_ the _vipassanâ_ exercise is made on past five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_.
1. To be free from _tahâ_-_ditthi_ attached to future five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_ the

` `_vipassanâ_ exercise is made on future five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_.

As explained in Section on the _Paccakkha ñâna_ and _Anvaya ñâna_, as to whether _paccakkha ñâna_ or _anvaya ñâna_ is employed in discerning on the past and future, the Buddha has expounded it to be _nâmarūpapariccheda ñâna_ to _attapaccakkha ñâna_. With reference to this –

_Pubbabhâge vipassanâñânena sammasanvasena_. R. _Sulu attapaccakkhena ñânena passati_ (_Sam_.-_Tî_.-2: 181)

What it means is that in the _vipassanâ_ prior to _ariyamagga_ the 12 phenomena of the five-fold _upâdânakkhandhâ_, existing as the past, future and present etc., are discerned analytically, _samâsana_, taking them as the object, by the power of which they are well discerned, well understood and well realized. These are acquired via _attapaccakkha ñâna_, called _vipassanâsammâditthi_. (for discerning by _Anvaya ñâna_ see section on Vipassanâ on pp )

If in deed _vipassanâ_ exercise is made on the past and future *khandhâ*s to be from the _tanhâ_-_ditthi_ attached to these. If so, which descriptions in this Baddekaratta suttana instruct for _viapassanâ_ meditation on the past and future? The answer is as follows.

1. _Atîtam nânvâgameya_ = The past must not be followed by with _tahnâ_-_ditthi_,
1. _Nappatikañkhe anâgatam_ = The future must not be anticipated with _tahnâ_-_ditthi_.

Note that these are instructions to exercise _vippasanâ_ on past and future *khandhâ*s so as to be free from attachment on the past and future _khandhâs_. Only by destruction of _kilesâ_ aggregates by virtue of _vipassanâ_ knowledge (the Path Knowledge) referred to as _nibbedhika_ knowledge, which is endowed this power, can these aggregates be eradicated. It must be noted that they cannot be disintegrated without discerning on the past and the future.

The _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ clung on the past and future will never cease without concen- trating on the past and future. Meditation is made on the present _khandhâs_ to free oneself from the _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ attached on the present *khandhâ*s. Similarly meditation is made on the past and future _khandhâs_ to free oneself from the _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ attached on the past and future *khandhâ*s. Read the following *suttana*s for further information.

` `_tassa_. _Vuttam hetam_ “_nibbattâ ye ca titthanti_, _âragge sâsapūpamâ_”_ti_ (_Sam_.-_Tî_.2: 213). Bhikkus …. _Rūpa_ which is the past and future is the _anicca_ (_dukkha_. _anatta_).

And the present _rūpa_ is not an exception. Bikkhus …. The nature of _anicca_ (of _dukkha_ and of _anatta_), realized by own knowledge referred to as _âgamasuta_, knowledge via practice referred to as _adhigamasuta_, are possessed by followers *sâvaka*s (or *ariyasâvaka*s). They do not linger on to the past _rūpa_ nor have enjoyment or anticipation for the future _rūpa_. They practice on the present _rūpa_ to be relieved of interest, attachment and for acquirement of, its dissolution. (Note that the same applies to _vedanâ_ etc.) (_Sam_.2: 17 – 18).

These bhikkhus have already analytically understood the past and future *rūpa*s (_vedanâ_, _saññâ_, _sankhâra_, _viññâna_) as _anicca_ (as _dukkha_, as _anatta_), and on the present *rūpa*s (_vedanâ_, _saññâ_, _sankhâra_, _viññâna_) they become tired of, and disinterested in

them. Then the bhikkhus are instructed by the Buddha that from the present to the past and future are all _anicca_. Following this admonition, as the Buddha already knows the _ijjâsayadhâtu_ by which these bhikkhus could analytically realized the fact that the present _rūpa_ (_vedanâ_, _saññâ_, _sankhâra_, _viññâna_) is the _aniica_ (_dukkha_, _anatta_), this _desanâ_ was given corresponding to the _ajjhâsaya_ wish of the believers (_Sam_.-*Tth*a.-2: 242).

Suppose the past and future _khandhâs_ are _anicca_ because of the fact that do not they exist in the present, the present _khandhâs_ would be more so (_anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_) as they did not and would not exist in the past and future too. This is because being present of the present *khandhâ*s is divided as arising and perishing phases by means of _udayabbaya_. – “_Nibbattâ ye ca ti_._t_._t_ _hanti_, _âragge sâsapūmâ_ = these *khandhâ*s exist as distinct appearance of mustard seed.s on the sharp edge of a chisel” (_Khu_.-7: 32) was the instruction. – Note it this way (_Sam_.-_T_. _î_.-2: 213).

To free oneself from attachment and clinging to the past and future *khandhâ*s, _vipassanâ_ must be exercised on these *khandhâ*s of the past and future.

**The Meaning of the Present in Baddekaratta Suttana**

Here the meaning of the present described in Baddekaratta suttana division into the past-future-present of the five-fold _khandhâs_ in the doctrines will be given. First, the opening of the Atthasâlinî atthakathâ.

_Paccuppannañca nâmetam tividham khanapaccuppannam_, _santatipaccuppannam_, _addhâpaccuppannañca_. \*Ekadvisantativârapariyâpa**nnam santatipaccuppanam\***. R. _Ekabhavaparicchanam pana **addâpaccuppannam** nâma_. _Yam sandhâya **baddekaratta- sutte –** “yo câ vuso mano_, _ye ca dhamma_, _ubhayametam paccuppannam_, _tasamim ce_

_paccuppanne chandarâgapatibaddham hoti viññânam_, _chandarâgapatibaddhattâ viññâ- nassa tadabhinandanti_, _tadabhinandato paccuppannesu dhammesu samhîratî_”_ti vuttam_. _Santatipaccuppannañcatta atthakathâsu âgatam_, _addhâpaccuppane sutte (Abhi_.-*Ttha.-*1:

445).

The _paccuppam_ object is of three kinds as follows.\*

1. _Khana paccuppam_
1. _Santati paccuppam_
1. _Addhâ paccuppam_
1. Of these three, the formative stage, corresponding to various causes, by _upâda_-_tthî_- _bhañga_ = _citta_-_cetasikka_ _dhamma_ groups, which are at the arising-static-perishing away phases, are _khanapaccuuppanna_.
1. The processes of _rūpa_ and _nâma_ are called _santati_. Included in the _rūpasantati_ process arising as a result of one _utu_ and one _ahâra_, two _utu_ and two _ahâra_, and the _citta_ and _cetasika nâma dhamma_ groups coincident with one and two thought processes, are _santatipaccuppana_.
1. The _rūpanâma_ distinguished within a certain existence is the _addhâpaccuppanna_. Referring to this addhâpaccuppanna the Venerable Mahâkaccé has admonished in

` `the **_Mahâkaccâna_ – _Baddekaratta suttana_**_ as follows._\_\_

“My colleague bhikkhus …. A certain _citta_ referred to as mental clear element does exist as do certain _dhamma_ object groups. This _mana_-_dhamma_ object as a pair is the _addhâpaccuppanna_. Suppose the _viññâna_, associated with and attached to the longing _ragachandhâ_, arises, then because of the association of this mental property _viññâna_ with longing _chandarâga_, that _mana_-_dhamma_ object will be clung to (by that individual). One who is so delighted in _mana_-_dhamma_ object will be attracted to present

*dhamma*s by the _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ (_Ma_.-3: 237).

Among these three kinds of present, the _santatipaccuppanna_ is described in the Commentary, and the _addhâpaccuppanna_ in B**addekaratta suttana** (_Abhi_-_Ttha_.-1: 445). Relevant to the above Pâli and Commentary, note that the present (_paccuppanna_), described in the **Baddekaratta suttana** refers to all five-fold _khandhâ_ (the 12 *âyatana*s) appearing throughout the existence extending from the five-fold _patisandhekhandhâ_ to the five-fold _cutikhandhâ_. Therefore in these *addhâpaccuppanna dhamma*s are included not only the five-fold _khandhâ_ that is formed today, but also those of yesterday and of the day before yesterday etc. up to the five-fold _patisandhekhandhâ_ throughout the life of an individual. In the same way, not only the five-fold _khandhâ_ that will arise today, but those arising tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, coming month, year and until death also. It should be noted that the meaning of the present used here is different from that used in everyday language.

The consciousness, the _viññâna_ which is the wishful clinging attached to the six object or five-fold _khandhâ_ in association with _chandarâga_ = it is difficult for arising of _mana_ on the *khanapaccuppanna dhamma*s which have attained _khanattaya_, called _upâda-tthî-bhañga_, in knowledge and which have acquired vision at _paramatta_ level. The _tahnâ_-_ditthi_ are most likely to occur on the _rūpa_-_nâma_ five-fold *khandhâ dhamma*s, called _addhâpaccuppanna_, designated by a certain existence. For this reason the Com- mentators have explained that the _paccuppanna_ in Baddekaratta suttanas are just the five- fold _khandhâ rūpa_-*nâma dhamma*s in a _bhava_ designated by a certain existence. These explanations, however, are made only in light of **_suttantapariyâyana_ method**, not the **_abhidhammanissena_ method.** Therefore, the concept of the _paccuppanna_ is also given in the light of _suttantapariyâyana_ and _abhidhammanissena_ methods.

**Designation of the Past, Future and Present**

_Yam kañci rūpam atîtamnâgatapaccuppannam ijjhattam vâ bahiddhâ vâ olârikam vâ hînam vâ panîtam vâ yam dūre santike vâ_, _tadekajjham abhisamyūhitvâ ayam vuccati rūpakkhandho_. _Yâ kâci vedanâ_. _Yâ kâci saññâ_. _Ye keci sankhâra_. _Yam kañci viññâ- nam atînâgatapaccuppannam_. R. _Abhisañkhipitvâ_ _ayam vuccati viññânakkhandho_

(_Abhi_.-2: 1 – 10).

_Idam pana atîtânâgatapaccuppannam nâma suttantapariyâyato abhidhammaniddesatoti duvidham_. _Tam suttantaparoyâye bhaven paricchanam_. _Patisandhito hi patthâya_

_atîtabhavesu nibbattam rūpam anantarabhave vâ nibbattam hotu kappakotisatasahassa-_

_mattake vâ_. _Sabbam anâgatameva nâma_. _Cutipatisandhiantare pavattarūpam paccuppannam nâma_ (_Abhi_.-_Ttha_.-2: 7).

**Translation of the Above Pâli**

There are the *rūpa dhamma*s of past-future-present durations, all the *rūpa dhamma*s of _ijjhattasantâna_, _bahiddhasantâna_, gross _olârika_ nature, subtle _sukhuma_ nature, lower and higher levels, the distant (from consciousness) _dūrarūpa_, the near (the

consciousness) _santirūpa_. These 11 kinds of _okâsa_ = indicative of the locality, that which make all the *rūpa*s subject to change, the 11 kinds which are grouped in brief by way of _ruppalakkhanâ_, of all the *rūpadhamman*s = are all called _rūpakkhandhâ_. (N.B. The same holds true for the _nâmakhandhâs_) (_Abhi_.-2: 1: 10).

It must be noted that, according to this Pâli, all the _rūpa_ *dhamma*s existing as 11 kinds are called _rūpakkhandhâ_.

**The _Suttanta Pariyâya_ Way**

_Pariyâya_ refers to that which has changed from the _Paramatthasabhâvadhamma_. It has named as _suttanta pariyâya_ way because the _suttana desanâ_ is _pariyâya desanâ_. In the _abhidhammâ_, it has been expounded as “_phassa-vedanâ_” etc., and such an expatiation has been given as”_abhidhammaniddesa_.”

This past, future and present _rūpa_ are of two kinds:

1. _Suttantapariyâya_ which has changed from _paramatthasabhâvadhamma_ = the _suttanadesanâ_ way,
1. Determined in the _abhidhammâ_ and expatiated as _abhidhammaniddesa_ = _abhi_-

` `_dhammadesanâ_ way.

In the _suttantapariyâya_ which has changed from _paramatthasabhâvadhamma_ the past-future-present *rūpa*s delineated by an existence. The following is how it is deli- neated.

1. From _patisandhe_ to all the *rūpa*s that have existed in the past – be it in the second

life in the past, the life in the _asañkhata_ period – are the *rūpa*s of the past.

2. From this _cutibhava_ to the *rūpa*s to be formed in the future life, be it formed in

the in second past existence or the life in the _asañkhata_ period, are all the future *rūpa*s.

3. The *rūpa*s, formed during the existence spanning from this _bhava cuti_ to this _bhava patisandhe_, are all _paccuppanna_ *rūpa*s (_Abhi_.-_Ttha_.-2: 7).

**The Abhidhammaniddesa Way**

_Abhidhammaniddesa pana khanena paricchannam_. _Tayo hi rūpassa khanâ uppâdo tthiti bhañgoti_. _Ime tayo khane patvâ niruddham rūpam samantaraniruddham vâ hotu atîte kappakotisatasahassamatthake vâ_, _sabbam atîtemeva nâma_. _Tayo khane asampattam rūpam etacittakkhanamattena vâ asampatam hotu anâgate kappakotisatasahassa mattake vâ_, _sabbam anâgatemeva nâma_. _Ime tayo khane sampattam rūpam pana paccuppannam_

_nâma_. _Tattha kañcâpi idam suttantabhâjanîyam_, _evum santepi abhidhammaniddeseneva atîtânâgatapaccuppannarūpam nidditthanti veditabbam_ (_Abhi_.-_Ttha_.-2: 7) _Abhidhammaniddesa_ = In _abhidhamma desanâ_, the past, future and present are

divided by moment. The following is how it is divided.

The momentary moment of _rūpa dhamma_ are of three kinds:

1. The arising _upâdakhana_,
1. The static _tthîkhana_, and
1. the perishing away _bhañkhana_.

These are the three _khanas_.

1. The _rūpa_ which has ceased after arriving at these three *khana*s has perished, there being no other alternative (= there is no other _rūpa_), be it that which has already ceased or be it that which had ceased in the past of _asañkhata_ period; and any *rūpa*s that have already ceased are all that of the past.
2. The _rūpa_ which has not yet arrived at the three *khana*s, be it the _rūpa_ which has not arrive even at a certain _cittakhana_, be it the _rūpa_ which will be formed in a future of an _asañkh ata_ period, any _rūpa_ which has not yet arrived at the three *khana*s still belong to the future.
3. All the *rūpa*s which have, and still are, at the three *khana*s are the _paccuppanna_

` `_rūpas_. It should be known this way (_Abhi_.-_Ttha_.-2: 7).

**A Fact that Should be Understood.**

_Tattha kañcâpi idam suttantabhâjanîyam_, _evum santepi abhidhammaniddeseneva atîtânâgatapaccuppananrūpam nidditthanti veditabba,_ (_Abhi_.-_Ttha_.-2: 7). **\*Kañcâpî**tiâdisu ayamadippâyo* – *suttantabhâjanîyatthâ* “*atîtam nânvâgameyâ*”*tiâdisu* (*Ma*.-3: 266). *Addhâvasena atîtâdibhâvova vutto*, *tathâ idhâpi niddisitabbo siyâ*. *Evum santepi suttantabhâjanîyampi abhidhammadesanâyeva suttante vuttadhammevicinitvâ vibhajanavasena pavattâti abhidhammaniddeseneva atîtâdibhâvo nidditthoti* (*Mūlatî\*-2: 6).

**\*Baddekarattasuttâ**dîsu viya atîtâdibhâvo atîtânâgatapaccuppannabhâvo addhâvasena idhâpi khandhavibhañge suttantabhâjanîyattâ niddhititabbo siyâti yojanâ* (*Anutî\*.-2:12)

The following gives the meaning of these _atthakathâ tîkâ_.

Of these two _suttantapariyâya_ and _abhidhammaniddesa_ ways, _khandhâvibhañ_- _bhâjaniya_ of this treatment is _suttantabhâjaniya_ way. As the nature of the past, future and present are exhorted by designating via an existence by power of _addhâ_, so should the nature of past, future and present be designated via an existence by power of _addhâ_ only. Although it should be so, the _suttantabhâjaniya dhamma_, like **_Baddekarattasut_- _tana_,** is a kind of **_Abhidhamma desanâ_** which appears by the power of analytical selection of individual objects of _paramattha vipassanâ ñâna_. Therefore, it must be noted that the Buddha has exhorted on the past, future and present via _Abhidhamma_- _niddesa_ way (_Abhi_.-_Ttha_.-2: 7; _Anutî_.-2:12).

[Note. According to the explanation given by the above doctrines the five-fold *khandhâ*s of the past, future and present have been instructed to be designated via an existence by the power of _addhâ_. It means that it the _suttantabhâjanîya_ way. But though it is the _suttantabhâjanîya_ way, it is a kind of _abhidhamâ desanâ_ which analyze the *dhamma*s that have been expatiated by way of analytical examination. Because of this, it must be remembered that the Buddha has instructed the five-fold *khandhâ*s of the past, future and present just by _abhidhamâ desanâ_ way.

What the above doctrines actually mean is as follows. –

1. _Addhâ_ = the period referred to as _Bhava_,
1. _Santati_ = the continuity,
1. _Samaya_ = time (period of time),
1. _Khana_ = moment which occurs as _upâda_-_tthî_-_bhañ_, all in four by virtue of which\* the past is designated.

The future and present are designated in the same way.

**The Period Denoted as _Addhâ_ (= _Bhava_)**

` `Of the four _addhâ_-_santati_-_samaya_-_khana_ categories, the **_addhâ_**-_saddâ_ is the time referred to as an existence designated by _cuti patisanddhe_.

**“_Ahosim nu kho atîtamaddhâ nam_.”** (_Ma_.-1: 10; _Sam_.-1: 256).

“Had I been formed at the time of the past existence.”

` `In this way it can be known, by power of _suttana desanâ_ way, from exhortation made in the Nidânavaggasamyutta, Ãhâravaga, Paccaya Suttana etc. that the _addhâ saddâ_ arises at a time of a certain existence delineated by _cuti patisandhe_.

In another way –

_Tayome bhikkhave addhâ_, _katame tayo_? _Atîto addhâ_, _anâgato addhâ_, _paccup- panno addhâ_ (_Khu_.-1: 232; _Dî_.-3: 181).

Bhikkhus …. The three periods are these. They are the past, future and present.

` `In this Pâli, by virtue of Khandhavaggasamyutta, Upayavaga, Niruttipatha suttana, the meaning of _addhâ_-_saddâ_ as given by designating moment of _upâda_-_tthî_-_bhañ_ = arising-static-perishing away of _paramatta_ is pertinent from view point of _paramat_._t_._h_ _a_.

It is so because in the **_Niruttapathasuttana_** is given as

_Yam_. _bhikkhave rūpam_. _jâtam_. _pâtubhūtam_., “_atthî_”_ti tassa sañkhâ_ (_Sam_. .-2: 60).

Bhikkhus …. That _rūpa_ is still arising, clearly appearing. Recognition of the

.

actual existence of that _rūpa_ by name arises (_Sam_.-2: 60).

In the **\*Niruttapatha** suttana* expatiation has been made of the distinctly arising *rūpa\* _dhamma_ in the state of _upâda_-_t_.._thî_-_bhañ_ as the present _rūpa_, as past _rūpa_ which has arisen long before the still existing present _rūpa_, and as the future _rūpa_ going to arise after the present.

` `Therefore, the following two kinds of period have been given in the _suttana_ _desanâ_.

1. An _addhâ_ as a kind of period, referred to as an existence designated by the _cuti_ _pantisandhe_ (= a time of existence)
1. An (_khana_) _addhâ_ (= a period called _khana_) designated by the prevailing _khana_

` `called _upâda_-_t_.._thî_-_bhañ_ = arising-static-perishing away of the *paramatta*s.

Although these two _addhâ_ are described in the *suttana desanâ*s, the Buddha has admonished in the _suttana_ and _pâli_ that the past, future and present existences are designated by _cuti patisandhe_ and _bhava_ referred to as _addhâ_ period.

Following the general exhortation the _atthakathâ sayâdaw_ has explained the

PAGE137

designation of the past, future and present in another way.
ūūūūū

1. **_Addhâ_** – at a certain time during the existence of a certain living being, all the *rûpa*s from the stage of _patisandhe_ of the prevailing _bhava_ to the past belong to the past *rûpa*s. The *rûpa*s spanning from the _cuti_ of this _bhava_ to those of the coming existence are all the future *rûpa*s. The *rûpa*s midway between the the past and future are all the present ones.
1. If stated by virtue of _santati_ (continuity), it will be as follows.
   ūūūūū
   A certain _rûpa_ which arises due to a certain relevant _utu_ as the cause, and to a certain _ahâra_ as a cause, might have done so by virtue of whether the long past or later, but is still the present _rûpa_. (It indicates that _sabhâgaekautusamu_._t_._thânarûpa_, _sabhâga- ekaahârasamu_._t_._thânarûpa_ is the _paccuppana rûpa_).

   ūūūū
   The _sabhâgaekautusamutthâna_, the _visabhâgautusamutthânarûpa_ after the _sabhâ- gaekâhârasamut_._t_._h_ _ânarûpa_ = irrelevant _utu_ as the cause, _visabhâgaâhârasamut_._t_._h_ _âna- rûpa_ = irrelevant _âhâra_ as the cause is the _rûpa_ that belongs to the future.

**_Sabhâgautu_** — the cold _sîtautu_ is the _sabhâgadhamma_ being relevant to _sîtautu_.

` `In the same way, the hot _unhautu_ is the _sabhâgautu_ being relevant to _unhautu_.

**_Ekautu_** — A combination of cold _sîtautu_, and hot _unhautu_ affecting the body together, or if a certain _uhnautu_ arises by virtue of association of the former and later
ū
*rûpa*s in a continuous process, a .c.e rtain phenomenon exists wh.i.c h is of its original nature, but no more nor less than it. That _utu_ is referred to as _ekautua_ = a particular kind of _utu_.  
ūūū
(The _utu_ that is exerting its effect on the material body is a continuous process of that of the former and later *rûpa*s. If that _utu_ would be measured by a thermometer, it would neither be less nor more, but remains constant throughout, and such an _utu_ is the _ekautu_ = said to be an _utu_. For example, if a cold _sîtarûpa_ process occurs continuously for an hour, then the continuity of the process of physical _utu_ in that duration will neither be more nor less, but constant; and so would be the hot _uhnarûpa_ process). Such a natural _dhamma_, because it has the same nature, should be taken as a factor of single phenomenon. This statement as _ekakâram_ = singleness of phenomenon, vindicates the non-existance of dissimilar nature of _sabhâgautu_.
ū
Within this _sabhâgautu_, however, the *utu*s (the physical changes), which are the _pramatthadhamma sabhâva_, are occurring in many ways. The *utujarûpa*s are arising and dissolving. Within a _sabhâgautu_ many *paramatthadhammasabhâva*s conspicuously are present, anf this situation might mislead one to take **_sabhâgautu_** as **_anekautu_**. To avoid this misconception, the _atthakat_._t_._h_ _â sayâdaw_ has expatiated as **_ekautusamut_._t_._h_ _ânam_** by inclusion of _eka_-_saddâ_ to make one understand via process of continuity just a single _utu_.

In this _âhârasamutthâna rûpa_ also Mûlatîkâsayâdaw has instructed the idea of _ekâhâra_ to be taken in a si.m. ilar way to the above. The food that is consumed many times

and many days, and irrelevent to _visabhâgaâhâra_, is an _âhâra_ of ū certain kind. ūū

Therefore, in the _atthakathâ_, it has been explained that – “the _rûpa_ resulting from the s*abhâgaekautusamu*._t_._t_ _h_._â_. _na rûpa_ and _sabhâgaekâhârasamut_._t_._h_ _âna rûpa_ formed due to

previous _vibâga_-_âhâra_, belongs to the past, and that formed later to the futureū” ū

But, because the _atthakathâ_ ūhas indicated as **\*ekâhârasamutthânam** aū rûpa\* resulting from a certain âhâ.r.a , the ***aūpare saya*s\*** have instructed that t**.**h**.**e\*\* _rûpa_ resulting

from a single _âhâra_ within a _rûpakalâpa_ is the _ekâhârasamut_._t_._h_ _âna rûpa_ = only when described comparatively as the _rûpa_ resulting from a certain _âhâra_, it will be relevent.

[The honorable _tîkâ sayâdaw_, named Ãcariyadhammapâla, has exhorted this **_vâda_** of the **honorable _apar_**.**_e_** **_sayâs_** in the ūast part of the explanation, it should noted in ūūūūūūūū

essence that it was madū so because they have ūhe will for some one to note in that way. In the present book too, when explanation was made of _rûpaghana_ and _nâmaghana_ in the section on _santatighana_, ūrûpa*s are described as the results a certain *utu* and an *âhâra*. The *utuja rûpa*s which have come to result step by step because of *tejo dhatu* within a *rûpa kalâpa*, which is like *cakkhudasaka kalâpa*, are the *rûpa dhamma*s resulting from the a certain single *utu*. So also, like the *cakkhudasaka kâpa*, the *âhârajarûpa*s, resulting step by step by support of the *ojâ* of the *ojâka âhârajarûpa*s, are the *rûpa dhamma*s resulting from a certain single *utu*. In cultivating and *vipassanâ* exercising on these *rûpa dhamma*s as instructed this way until attainment of *khana paccuppana*, of acquiring eye of wisdom to arrive at *paramat*.*t*.*h\* _a_, and only when the _paramat_._t_._h_ _a_ is so attained will the light of anatta brilliantly shine.]

This is how the *utujarûpa*s and the *âhârja rûpa*s of the past, future and present times are designated by the power of _santati_. The designation of the past, future and present times of the *cittajarûpa*s by virtue of _santati_ is as follows.

**_Santati_ of _Cittasamutthâna_**

The mūterial phenomenon of consciousness p**..**r\*\* oduced from mind are called
ū

1. _Rūpa_ formed of a certain five door process,
1. _Rûpa_ formed of a certain mind-door process,
1. _Rûpa_ formed of aūcertain _samâpatti_ = _samâpattivîthi_ as the cause, are all the \*
   ` `_paccuppana rûpa_. ūū

The previous material phenomenon of mind formed of a certain five-door process,_ that_ formed of a certain mind-door process, and that formed of a certain _samâpatta_ is the _rûpa_ of the past. The material phenomenon of mind that is produced later is the _rûpa_ of the future.

**.. _Santati_ of _Kammasamutthaâna_** ū

The _kamma_-produced _kammasamutthâna rûpa_ by virtue of the _santati_ process which are not defferentiated as of the pas..t , present and future respectively. (What it

means is that because the material phenomenon formed of _kamma_ is produced by the previous _kamma_ there is no variation in the _santati_.). With respect to this assertion, it

PAGE142

should be noted that differentiation ūf the past, future and present by power of which

1. _Utusamutthana rûpa_ (= material phenomenon formed of physical change),
1. _Ãhârasam_.._u_ _t_._t_._h_ _âna rûpa_ (= material phenomenon formed of nutrition),
1. _Cittasamu_._t_._t_ _hâna rûpa_ (= material phenomenon formed of consciousness) can be

   produced.
   ū
   After describing the past, future and present *rûpa*s which are produced by power of _santati_, the _at_._t_._h_ _akathâ_ has explained the differentiation of the past, future and present *rûpa*s by power of _samaya_.

In this context –

1. _Samaya_ =ūby power of _santati_, but not considering the time period –
1. Not considering the _santati_, but by power of _samaya_, the *rûpa*s of the past, future and present should be analytically differentiated (_Mûla_._tî_ .-2: 7; _Anut_._î_ .-2: 12).

   ū
   In accordance with the explanation of this _tîkâ_, _rûpa_ which is appearing, complete
   ū
   with the three minor _khanas_ such as _upâda_-._t_._t_ _hî_-_bh_._añ_, is referred to as _rûpa_ of the present from point of view of _udayabbaya ñân_._a_. For a beginner, an _âdikammika_ individual,

recognizing this _paccuppanna rûpa_ analytically is very difficult. To begin with, there-

fore, taking to heart via _vipassanâ_ by virtue of _santatipaccuppanna_ must be exercised.

    ū
    In this way the mind of that meditator will become clear and active. Then in his knowledge will appear the recognition of the arising and perishing away of the _rûpa_ *dhamma*s and and *nâma dhamma*s with every passing moment (_Mahâ_._tî_.-2: 422).

Therefore, the _santatipaccuppana_ and _samayapaccuppana_ are very helpful to attain the _khanapaccuppanna_ of the _rûpa-nâmaparamatta_ through the eye of wisdom. For this reason the terms _santatikathâ_ and _samayakathâ_ have been explained by the older _a_._t_._t_ _hakathâ sayadaws_. In Pâli, however, direct mention has been made only of the two kinds: the _addhâ_ and _khana_.
ūūū
**Division of the Past-Future-Present by Way of _Khana_**

The _rûpa_ that belongs to the three minor _khanas_ as _upâda_-_t_._t_._h_ _î_-_bhañ_ is that of the present. That which was formed prior to this _rûpa_ is that of the past, and all the *rûpa*s

..

that would be formed after the present belong to the future (_Abhi-ttha.-2_: 7 - 8; _Visuddhi_- 2: 113).
ūūū
**Explained in Another Way**
ūū
The rûpa of previous _hetukicca_ and _paccayakicca_ belongs to the past. The _rûpa_ which is of accomplished _hetukicca_, but _paccayakicca_ yet to accomplish, belongs to the present. When both _hetukicca_ and _paccayakicca_ are not yet accomplished, then the _rûpa_ belongs to the future.
ū
Or the _rûpa_ still arising while at the moment of performing its _kicca_ is that of the present. That which is of the time perior to the present is of the past. The _rûpa_ that is formed later belongs to the future.
ū
The _janaka_ cause which can directly produce the *rûpa dhamma*s is the _hetu_ cause. The _upatthambhaka_ cause which provides support is the _paccaya_ cause.
ūū
_Janaka_ (= _hetu_) which as a cause directly produces the _rûpa_ is the _hetu_ function. The provision of support by _upatthambhaka_ as a cause (_paccaya_ cause) is the _paccya_ function.
ū
For example production of a sprout is the function of a fertile seed. Water-soil- _utu_ (= _pathavîrasa_-_âporasa_-sunlight), which provide support in production of the sprout, is the function of water, soil, utu etc. (This is a example from mundane point of view). _nâma_ is*K* t*a*h*t*.e*a* *t*f*t*u*â*n*r*c*û*t*p*io*a*n o fo f*k* *a*th*m*i*m*s _kaa_ =_m_ t*m*h*a*e .f o Trmhea tsiuopnp oofr t*k* *a*p*m*ro*m*v*a*id-epdro bdyu ctehde _râûhpâar_ *a*a nedtc t.h ien rtehseu lptaron-t
ūūūūūūūū
duction of the _kamma_-produced _rûpa_ and the resultant _nâma_ is the function of this _âhâra_. (This is an example from _sâsanâ_ point of view).
ūūū
Similar to the above examples, a certain _rûpakalâpa_ and a certain _cittuppâda_, referred to as mind and mental concomitant = _kamma_ which is a _janaka_ force that can directly produce _kamma_-produced _rûpa_ and the resultant _nâma_. Thus providing support by means of _paccaya_ forces such as the _nânâkkhanikakamma_ force, _upanissaya_ force and _âhâra_ force. In these resultant _rûpa_-*nâma dhamma*s too, the four-fold *nâmakhandhâ*s and *paramatta dhamma*s are reciprocating each other by way of _paccaya_ forces such as _sahajâta_ etc.. The four great elements of _bhûtarûpa_ are supporting each other, as the _bhûtarûpa_ is supporting the _upâdârûpa_, by way of _paccaya_ forces such as _sahajâta_ etc..

In this way, the _rûpa_ which is arising and* at the moment of performing its own function such as *hetukicca* (= *janakakicca*), *upatthambhakakicca* (= *paccayakicca*), is the present *rûpa*. The *rûpa* prior to this belongs to the past and that about to be formed to the future. (*Mula*.*t\* _î_.-2: 7; _Anu_._t_ _î_.-2: 12 – 13).

**Certainty and _Pariyâya_**

_It_._t_._h_ _a ca khanâdikathâva nippariyâyâ_, _sesâ pariyâyâ_ (_Abhi_.-_T_.._t_ *ha.-*2: 8; _Visuddhi_-2: 203). In designation of the past, future and present, the terms _khanakathâ_ and _kiccakathâ_ are not _pariyâya_ but are the terms of certainty. The remaining terms such as –

1. _Addhâkathâ_ = a term related to time period of a _bhava_,
1. _Santatikathâ_ = a term related to continuity,
1. _Samayakathâ_ = a term related to time – are the terms accompanied by _pariyâya_.

Among various terms, the certainty but not the _pariyâya_, is what is required in this Vibhañpâli (_Abhi_.-_T_.._t_ _ha_.-2: 8).

**The Designation of the Past-Future-Present in _Nâma_**

_Atîtâdivibhâge panattha santativasena khanâdivasena ca vedanâya atîtânâgata- paccupppannabhâvo veditabbo_. _Tattha **santativasena** ekavîthiekajavanaekasammapatti_-

` `Here, in discrimitating the past, future and present _santati_ = by virtue of continuity and of _khana_-_kicca_, the state of being the past, future and present of the _vedanâ_ (the four- fold _khandhâs_).

Then it could be stated from point of view of _santati_ as follows.

1. _Vedanâ_ related to one of five-door processes,
1. _Vedanâ_ related to one of mind-door processes,
1. _Vedanâ_ related to a certain _samâpatti_,
1. The unique feature of the Buddha as the only object of corporeality, the sound of recitation of _desanâ_ as the only object of sense of hearing etc., the object received by the five-fold door processes, and the _vedanâ_ that are included in _tadanuvattika_, mind-door processes etc. which still take them as the object, are the *paccuppanna vedanâ*s. Those that were prior to these belong to the past, and those to be formed

` `later belong to the future.

If stated in relation to _khana_-_kicca_, it will be as follows.

` `The *vedanâ*s associated with the three *khana*s, such as _upâ_._d_. _a_-_tthî_-_bhañ_, are all _paccuppanna vedanâs_. The *vedanâ*s produced prior to those associated with these

three *khana*s are of the past, and those arising after those associated with these three

` `*khana*s are of the future.

The *vedanâ*s produced between the front end, the _upâda_, and the hind end, the _bhañ_, i.e., *vedanâ*s associated with the three *khana*s, and located midway between that prior to or after it, which are still in arising state and performing its own functions, are the *paccuppanna vedanâ*s. The *vedanâ*s which have arisen before these are of the past and those that are going to arise aftward are of the future (_Abhi_.-_T_.._t_ _ha_.-2: 13; _Visuddhi_-2: 104)
ūū
Note that it is the same in the remaining three *nâmakhandhâ*s as in the case of the *vedanakkhandhâ*s. This how the the past, future and present are appreciated in the five- fold *khandhâ*s. **.**
ūū
**_Bhûtam Bhûtato Passati_**
ūūūūūūū
_Bhûtam bhûtato passati_ = seeing things as they really are. With reference to this _desanâ_, some have conceived that _vipassanâ_ exercise should be made with emphasis only on the _paccuppanna_. Now the explanation will be made as to what this _desanâ_ really means.

Bhikkhus …. How do those who could rightly understand = those endowed with eye of wisdom, called _yathâbhûtañân_. _adassana_, could visualize the phenomena in their ū

` `true nature? ūūūūū

Bhikkhus …. In this ūsâsanâ*, a meditating monk could visualize the five-fold *khandhâ*s in their true nature, each resulting from its own respective cause, and each distinct by way of *paramattha* = via respective specific character, via general character referred to as the properties of impermanance, of suffering and of unreality, which are concerned with all elements of *paramattha*, the five-fold *khandhâ*s are visualized by eye of wisdom (called *vipassanâdi*.*t*.*thi* and *maggasammâdit*.*t*.*hi*). He practices for the purpose of freeing himself from, attachment and clinging to the five-fold *khandhâ*s with specific and general characters by discerning on their true nature. Bhikkhus …. Those who are endowed with the eye of wisdom, called *yathâbhûtañân*. *adassana*, never falter but see things in their true nature (*Khu*.-1: 224; *Itivuttaka-Di*.*t*.*thigata\* Suttan).

All these five-fold *khandhâ*s are just the _nâma-rûpa_. In these five, “the *dhamma*s, such as the _patūvî_ etc., are _rûpa_; the *dhamma*s, like _phassa_ etc., are _nâma_. These are the _lakkhaūa_-_raūa_-_paccupatthâna_-_padatthâna_ (property, taste, manifestation, and proximate cause)* of the *rûpa-nâma*. These are the *dhamma*ū of *avijjâ*, *tahnâ*, *upâdâna*, *sañkhâra*, *kamma* etc., of the *rûpa-nâma*. By visualizing the *rûpa-nâma\* and their causes in this way. And

` `“These _rûpa-nâmadhamma_ and *sañkhâra dhamma*s all just made their appearances all of a sudden now, anū are non-existant before; persish away suddenly and are, therefore impermanence. Because of being impermanent, they are sufferings, and so they

are unrealities.” In this way, by virtue of _aniccânupassanâ_ etc., the visualization of th**.**e** _rûpa-nâma_ and their causes are acquired. This is what really is meant by \***bhûtam bhûtato passati\* =** seeing things as they truly are. This much description would suffice to indicate the location of \***vipassanâbhûmi**_ = plane of the insight knowledge which culmi- nates in the _**tarunavipassanâ*\*\* (*Itivuttakatthakathâ\*: 170 – 171).

**[N.B. _Tarunavipassanâ_** = _vipassanâ_ in early stage is the name of four *ñâna*s: _sañkhârapricchedañâna_ (_ñâmarûpaparicchedañâna_), _kañkhâvikaranañâna_ (._paccaya- pariggahañâna_), _sammasanañâna, maggâmaggañâna_ (= _udayabbayañâna_). _Sam.-T_.._t_ _ha._- 2: 50.]

**_Nibbidâya_** = to be tedius with worldly life means to become weary of worldly affairs such as the *dhamma*s of the three stages of being within the the three planes of life By this _nibbidâya_, a forceful _vipassanâ_ referred to as **_balavavipassanâ_** is indicated by the

[N.B. ***Balavavipassanâ*** is the name of four *ñâna*s such as *bhayatûpat*.*thânañâna*, *âdînavânupassanâñâna, muncitukamayatâñâna and sañkhârupakkhâñâna*. *Sam.-T*..*t* *ha.*- 2: 50.]
ūūūū
**_Virâgâya_** = A prctice leading to detachment from desire and craving. The _Ariya_- _magga_ is indicated by the _virâga_. **_Nirodhâya_** = A practice leading to cessation of _râga_ like desire and craving. By this _nirodhâya_ too _Ariyamagga_ is indicated. Put in another way, it is indicated that **_nirodhâya_** also can the extinguish fire of _kilesâ_, and is assisted to completely extinguish by _ariyamaggaphala_ named _patipassaddhinirodha_ and _khandha_- _parinibbana_ named _anupâdisesanibbâna_ (_Itivuttakatthaka.-Tthâ_: 171).

**_Evum kho bhikkhave cakkhumanto passanti_** = Bhikkhu … The assertion that the noble ones who are endowed with the eye of wisdom, called _yathâbhûtañânadassana_, never falter but see things in their true nature means those who are so endowed could visualize the four truth, called the _dhamma_ of the four noble truth, by means of _vipassanâcakkhu_ together with _maggapaññâcakkhu_ referred to as _pubbhâgasatipat-_ _thânamagga_ which occurs prior to _maggaariyamagga_ (_Itivuttakatthaka.-T_.._t_ _hâ_: 171).
ūū
In accordance with this opening of the _atthalathâ_ – **_bhûtam bhûtato passati_** = **realizing things as they truly are** – note that it visualizing the four truth, called the _dhamma_ of the four noble truth, by means of _vipassanâpaññâcakkhu_ and _ariymagga- paññâcakkhu_. In explaining this way, the _atthakathâ sayâdaw_ has referred to excerpts – _bhûtamidam bhikkhave samanupassattha_ etc. – from _Mûlapannâsapâli_ **_Mahâtahnâsañ-_** **_khaya suttana_** Therefore, these will be described here.

Our Lord …. We do.

Bhikkhus …. Do you realize that the five-fold *khandhâ*s cease, at the time of _parinibbâna_, by means of non-reappearable cessation, called the nature of _anuppâda- nirodha_, because of the dissolution of the causes like _avijjâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, _sañkhâra_ and _kamma_ by means of non-reappearable cessation, called _anuppâdanirodha_, by virtue

PAGE149

of _arahattamagga_. ūū

Our Lord …. We do. (*Ma.-*1: 326).

In this _suttana_ the Buddha, in continuation, has expatiated _anulomapaccayakâra_, referred to as the process of formation of _sansarâ_ called the _anulomapaticca samuppâda desanâ_, and the _patilomapaccayakâra_, referred to as the process of dissolution of the _sansarâ_ called _patilomapaticca samuppâda desanâ_.

In concord with these *desanâ*s – _bhûtam_. _bhûtato passati –_ realizing things as they really are is exaplined as follows.

1. The truth of suffering of the five-fold *khandhâ*s with past, future, present, internal, external, gross, delicate, inferior, superior, remote, near etc. as 11 characters which the _âsava_ _dhamma_ take as object and at which attachment by _tahnâ-ditthi_ is made as I-Mine, are realized by insight knowledge referred to as _attapaccakhañâna_. And are also realized by _asammohapativedha_ (discriminative insight of the object) and _ariyamaggapaññâ_ which can visualize penetratively.
1. The _avijjâ, tahnâ, upâdâna, sañkhâra_ and _kamma_ named the truth of arising of the sufferings of the past cultivated when the previous existance was established,
1. the distinct formation as the resultant these causes of the present five-fold rebirth *khandhâ*s as the truth of arising of the sufferings, and because of these causes the future five-fold rebirth *khandhâ*s as the truth of arising of the sufferings, are realized by insight knowledge known as _attapaccakkhañâna_. And are also realized by _asammohapativedha_ and _ariyamaggapaññâ_ which can visualize penetratively. (It is the _paccayto udayadassana_. See _Visuddhi_-2: 267).
1. When vipassanâ exercise is made on the truth of arising of the sufferings as the causative factor and the truth of sufferings as the resultant, the meditator sees the arising and perishing away of the truth of sufferings, the truth of arising of the sufferings, the nature of imperamnence, suffering and non-self of these *sañkhâra dhamma*s, by insight knowledge called _attapaccakkhañâna_.They are also realized by _asammohapativedha_ and _ariyamaggapaññâ_ which can visualize penetratively. (It is vision of truth of sufferrings due to penetrative knolwedge of _jâtidukkha_ and _maranadukkha_. _Visuddhi_-2: 267).
1. When the causes, the truth of the origin of sufferings, get extinguished because of _arahattamagga_ by way of non-reappearable cessation called _anuppâdanirodha_, the resultant *upâdânakkhandhâ*s enter _khandhaparinibbana_ and get dissolved by way of non-reappaearable cessation. This is realized by insight knowledge referred to as _attapaccakkhanñâna_. It is also realized by the penetrative sight of _ariyamaggapaññâ_ by virtue of nature _asammohapativedha_. (It is the _paccayato vayadassanañâna_. _Visuddhi_-2: 267).
1. When one is able to exercise _vipassanâ_ on the _vipassanâñâna_ which can concen- trate, referred to as _pativipassanâ_, then _sammâditthi_ (= insight knowledge), _sammâsañkappa_ (= _vitakka_), _sammâsati_, _sammâsamâdhi_ (= _ekaggatâ_) which are the *lokîmaggasaccâ dhamma*s initiated by _vipassanâñâna_ associated in the absorption of the _vipassanâ_ discerning at that moment, are also realized by insight knowledge referred to as _attapaccakkhanñâna_. It is also realized by the pene- trative sight of _ariyamaggapaññâ_ by virtue of nature _asammohapativedha_. (It is nominated as _maggasaccâ_ because these _lokîmaggañ_ *dhamma*s can detach, for a moment, the delusion which hinders the understanding of nature of arising and passing away of _sañkhâra_ phenomena. It is the _lokîmaggasaccâ_. *Visuddhi-*2: 267 -268).
1. At the end of insight knowledge and when _ariyamaggañâna_ appears distinctly, the noble _dhamma_ called the truth of cessation of suffering referred to as the _asañkhatadhâtu_ and the element of peacefulness, the _nibbâna_, will also be visualized. (It is the _lokuttara nirodhasaccâ_, and the _arammanapativedha_).
1. The noble eightfold path associated with _ariyamagga_ is the _maggasaccâ_.  
   \*
   ` `The _ariyamagga_ also can discern the _maggasaccâ dhamma_ by way of _asammohapativedha_. (It is the _lokuttarâ maggasaccâdhamma_. It is the _asammo-_ ūū

` `_hapativedha_). ū

` `In this way, those who are possessed of the insight knowledge\* referred to as

_attapaccakkhañâna_ and eye of wisdom, called _ariyamaggapaññâ_, can see the four- fold truth _dhamma_ (_catusaccadhamma_) of the _lokî_ and _lokuttarâ_ by the eye of insight knowledge before, and by the eye of _ariyamaggapaññâ_, .d uring the _ariyamaggakhana_. The realization in this way has been designated as – _bhûtam bhûtato passati_ – seeing things as they realy are.

In accordance with these explanations, from aspect of _bhûta_ – the causes of the present _upâdânakkhandha,_ when the _kamma bhava_ was being cultivated, initiated by _avijjâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, the _kilesavatta_ and _upâdânakkhandhâ,_ the _kammavatta_ and _upâdânakkhandhâ_ called the _sañkhâra_ and _kamma,_ and root of these _kilesâ vatta_ called the _vipâkavatta_ and *upâdânakkhandhâ*s of the previous _bhava_ are also included. The present _vipâkavatta upâdânakkhandhâ_ resultants, due to these past causes, are also included here.

Therefore, the cause _upâdânakkhandhâ_ and the resultant _upâdânakkhandhâ_, within the three periods of the past, future and present, are discerned until their specific characters are attained. The realization of the specific characters, together with _rasa_, _paccuppatthâna_ and _padatthâna_, of each of _paramatthadhâtu_ associated with these five- fold *khandhâ*s by means of _vipassanâpaññâcakkhu_ and _ariyamaggapaññâcakkhu_ can

` `also be taken to see things as they really are.

Again, realization, by _vipassanâpaññâcakkhu_ and _ariyamaggapaññâcakkhu_, of distinct arising of the resultant _upâdânakkhandhâ_ because of the existence of causes _upâdânakkhandhâ_ referred to as _kilesâvatta_, _kammavatta_, and because of the dissolution of the causes _upâdânakkhandhâ_ by the nature of _anuppâda-nirodha_ due to _arahattamagga_, the resultants _upâdânakkhandhâ_ cease when they enter _parinibbâna_ by means of _anuppâdanirodha_, can also be taken to see things as they really are.

Again, the understanding the impermanent, the suffering and non-self phenomena of the cause _upâdânakkhandhâ_ and the resultant _upâdânakkhandhâ_ by virtue of the _vipassanâpaññâcakkhu_ and _ariyamaggapaññâcakkhu_ is also seeing things as they really are.

` `The realization ūf _vipūssanâmanodvârikajovîthi_ groups of mental processes, called the _vipassanâñâna_ which can concentrate, and their _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ pheno- mena, by way of _vipassanâpaññâcakkhu_ and _ariyamaggapaññâcakkhu_ is also seeing the things as they really are.

Once again realization of _Nibbâna dhamma_, which is the _lokuttarâ nirodhasaccâ_, by way of _ârammanapativedha_ and _ariyamaggapaññâcakkhu_ is called seeing things as they really are.

.

Therefore, the _desanâ_ – _bhûtam bhûtato passati_ = seeing things as they really are, is not one that instruct to meditate on just the present, ignoring the attainment of the cause _upâdânakkhandha_ and resultant _upâdânakkhandhâ_ in any convenient way without treating _paññatti_ and _paramatta_ separately nor distinguishing the two. It must be noted that this _desanâ_ instructs to concentrate, on the cause _upâdânakkhandha_ and resultant _upâdânakkhandhâ_ to arrive at their specific and general characters and until the truth of the sessation of sufferings the _nibbâna_ is attained, by the _vipassanâpaññâcakkhu_ and _ariyamaggapaññâcakkhu_.

**The Pillars of _Sâsanâ_**

Suppose you, as a meditator, wish to see, arrive at, know, penetrate by knowledge of yours, and oriented toward the _mahâasañkhatadhâtu nibbâna dhamma_, which is the abode of Bhuddhas and the Noble Ones. Then, to acquire it you must practice the Noble Eight Path exercise, without deviation in the direction, which is forceful enough to attain _nibbâna_ straight away. While you are on the right path there are (Four Vinaya) Four Rules of Bhuddhist Order that you must abide by to keep you from straying away from the right direction. The four rules are:

1. _Sutta_,
1. _Suttanuloma_,
1. _Ãcariyavâda_ and
1. Attanomati.\*\*

**1. _Sutta_**

**_Suttam_**.\*\* _nâma tisso sangîtiyo âruhlâni tîni pitakâni_. (*Dî.-Ttha.-*2: 158).

**_Sutta_ –** The first _pancasatikasangâyanâ_ was. held by (500..) _rahantâ_ supervised by the Reverend Ashinmahâkassapa, the second Council _sattasatikasangâyanâ_ by (700)

_rahantâ_ supervised by the Reverend Ashinmahâyasa and the third _sahassikasangâyanâ_ by (1000) _rahantâ_ headed by the Reverend Ashinmahâmoggaliputtatissa, and the Sutta- Vinaya-Abhidhammâ, together called The Triad of _Pit_._a_ _ka_ presented and passed by these three _sangâyanâ_ are the **Sutta**. Why it was so named is as follows.

In the triad of pitaka, including _suttan pitaka_, the Buddha has set forth various kinds of practice and working processes for acq.u iring one’s own and others’ triad of

benefit as man-god-_nibbâna_, the everlasting peace. For those god, man, _byahmâ,_ _veneyya_ and sentient beings who are to be relieved of the worldly affairs, exhortions have been made in different ways relevent to their _icchâsayadhâtu_, their habit and conditions. Because the triad of _pit_._a_ _ka_ can expose the sentient beings to various sorts of benefit, it has been named **_sutta_**.

As paddy plant would bear fruits, so would triad of _pitaka_, bless peace on human, god, _byahm_. _â_ and peace of _nibbâna_, and because the triad yields various kinds of peace, it is name **_sutta_**.

As a cow would let the milk down, so would the Buddha’s instructions, called the triad of _pitaka_, bless different kinds of benefit as peace on human, god, _byahmâ_ and peace of _nibbâna_, and because of this, it is named **_sutta_**.

Because the Buddha’s speeches, referred to as the triad of _pitaka_ will look after the well-being of the human, byahmâ and nibbâna, and care of the various kinds of good practice for acquiring these benefits, it is again named **_sutta_**.

A measuring tape, used by a carpenter in choosing the right measure of a piece of wood, and sawing up a measured dimension, is the _sutta_. A line marking the measured dimension is the amount needed, because if the wood is sawed up long the measured line, it would give the dimension required. Similarly the triad of _pitaka_ direct – this is the way to _nibbâna_ – one to _nibbâna_. And since these *desanâ*s are directing one to _nibbâna_ as the measured line of demarkation enables the carpenter to cut the right dimension, it is called **_sutta_**. If a controversy ever arises with regard to the right or wrong way to the _nibbâna_, then it is the triad of _pitaka_, named _sutta_, on which the wise would relie to decide which is the right way and which is not.

As wind cannot disperse the flowers held by a thread in garlend, so will the benefits such as the peacefulness of human, _byahmâ_ and _nibbâna_, held together by the force of practice and working processes provided by the triad. Because of this property, the triad of _pitaka_ is nominated as **_sutta_** (_Dî.-Ttha._-1: 18).

**Those Who Are Rejecting the Buddha**

_Tattha suttam_. _appatibâhiyam_. _, tam_. _patibâhantena buddhova patibâhito hoti_ (_Dî.-Ttha._-2:

158). ..

The meaning of this _atthakathâ_ is this. If someone presented a statement of the four _vinaya_, _sutta_ etc. inclusive, and if it is the _sutta_ called the triad of _pi_._t_ _aka_, which has been presented to and passed by the three *sangâyanâ*s, then it should not be rejected. If the statement = the _pi_._t_ _aka_ is rejcted or ignored, the it is no other than rejecting or ignoring the _sammâsambuddha_ (the perfectly enlightened ones). This is what the _atthakathâ_ really means.

m..e aningT hoifs stMataehmâepnatr iinni btbhâen *a*a.*t*s.*t*u *h*t*a*ta*k*n*a*a*th*, *â*i s*s* *u*fo*tt*r*a* *m*a *a*m*hâ*e*v*d*â*it,a* toopre, nwinhgo aiss tghoe inexgp alalonnatgi otnh eo fp aththe leading to *nibbâna\*, to follow and be kept firmly in mind. A meditator is reminded that,

when searching for the right path to _nibbâna_, and when following this road, the Buddha is the best guide referred to as _maggakkhâyî_ (one who tells the right way) and must not be ignored.

**What Utterings of *Sammâambuddha*s Are**

_Yañca bhikkhave rattimtathâgato anuttaram_. _sammâsambhod_._h_ _im_. _abhisambucchati_, _yañca rattim_. _anuppâdisesâya nibb_. _ânadhâtuyâ parinibbâyati_, _yam etassamim_.\* _antare bhâsati_

_lapati niddisati_, _sabbam tam tatheva hoti no aññathâ_. _Tassamâ “tathâgato”ti vuccati._ (*Am.-*1: 332 – _Lokasuttan_).

Bikkhus I, as one who has found the truth and your teacher, can penetratively discern the knowledge of the perfectly enlightened, called the uncompared highest stage of the path knowledge and knowledge of omniscience, in the night. In the night I entered the stage of _parinibbâna_ by way of _anupâdisesanibbânadhâtu_ called dissolution of the five-fold *khandhâ*s in a non-reappearable cessation. During the span of those two nights, I speak, expatiate and instruct the _dhamma_. These complete _dhamma_ speeches are true as they are spoken, extorted and advised. There never is the other any thing that is untrue in itself. Therefore, you all should recognize me as your teacher the **_tathâgata_**

(*Am.-*1: 332).

With reference to the above _Pâli_, starting from the night of attainment of perfectly enlightened stage until the night _parinibbâna_ (demise), a duration of (45) years of his life, all the _dhamma_ speech that the Buddha has given are nothing but the truth. There is none

that is other than the truth. Suppose a meditator would like to reject these true speeches. Then he should have, in his _santâna,_ a knowledge comparable to or superior to the analy- tically preached _dhamma_ and the completely self-enlightened knowledge acquired through practice of the (30) species of the 10-fold perfection for four _sankkheyya_ and a lakh of universes. Only then he can establish a _sâsanâ_ parallel to the knowledge of omniscience.

The Buddha himself, however, has already exhorted to the famous upaka that there is there is no such as thing as knowledge comparable to superior to the knowledge

` `of omniscience.

_Na me âcariyo atthi_, _sadiso mū na vijjati_.

_Sadevakassamim lokassamim_, _natthi me patipuggalo_.

_Aham hi arahâ loke,, aham satthâ anussaro_.

_Ekohm sammâsambhuddho_, _sîtibhûtosami nibbuto_ (_Ma_.-1: 227).

Upaka …. There is no one who as a teacher has adviced me to acquire the knowledge of omniscience, I am uncompared. There is no one among the *deva*s nor in the whole _loka_ who can compete with me.

In this _loka_ the I am the _Rahantâ_, non-imitable, leader of the *deva*s and humans. I am the only God who rightly self-understands the whole _dhamma_. I am peaceful as all moral defilements have been extinguished (_Ma_.-1: 227).

Read following again. ū

_Advacchavacanâ buddha_, _amoghavacanâ jinâ_.

_Vitatham natthi buddhânam_, _dhuvum buddho bhavâmaham_.

_Yathâ khittam nabhe littu_, _dhuvum patati bhûmiyam_.

The *buddha*s are not used to speak double entente. The *buddha*s, who have destroyed the five-fold evil, do not speak nonsensical words. Their speeches are never erroneous. Therefore, I should definitely be the Buddha.

As stone thrown upwards will definitely come down, so are the speeches of *buddha*s are always right.

The words of the *buddha*s are always true as the universal truth that all living things must succumb to death.

It is true that the sun always rises when the night comes to its end, similarly true always are the speeches of the *buddha*s. It is true that a lion will always roar as he comes out of his den after sleep, and so it is also true that the *buddha*s always speak truth.

It is true that a pregnant woman would give birth to her child after carrying it full term, and in the same way it is true that the *buddha*s’ speeches are always true.

**_Suttanuloma_** is the four-fold _vinaya mahâpadesa_ i.n. the _Vinayadesanâ_ and the four-fold _suttanamahâpadesa_ in the _Suttanadesanâ_. The four-fold _vinayamahâpadesa_ is

given in _Vinayamahâvâpâli Bhesajjkkhandhaka_ (348 – 349). The four-fold _suttana- mahâpadesa_ is given in _Suttamahâvâ Mahâparinibbânasuttana_ (_Dî_.-2: 202 – 204).

**The Four-Fold V*inayamahâpadesadhamma***

1. Bhikkhus …. I should not advice you to reject a certain thing as “this thing is not suitable”. It should be investigated with reference to _vinayadesanâ_, and if it is more towards the irrelevance than the relevance, then my sons, it is not suitable for you.
1. Bhikkhus …. I should not advice you to reject a certain thing as “this thing is not suitable”. It should be investigated with reference to _vinayadesanâ_, and if it is more towards the relevance than the irrelevance, then my sons, it is suitable for you.
1. Bhikkhus …. I should not permit you to accept a certain thing as “it is suitable.” That which is not permissible, when investigated referring to the _vianayadesanâ_, and if it is more towards the irrelevance than the relevance, then my sons, it is not suitable for you.
1. Bhikkhus …. I should not permit you to accept a certain thing as “it is suitable.” That which is not permissible, when investigated referring to the _vianayadesanâ_, and if it is more towards the relevance than the irrelevance, then my sons, it is

` `suitable for you (*Vi.-*3: 348 – 349).

` `These are the four main rules named as _mahâpadesa_ exhorted in the _vinayadesanâ_. “This is the affair suitable for the monks, and this not.” If an affair is to be decided whther it is suitable or not, then the decision has to be made in consultation with the four- fold _vinaya_ rules, called _vinayamahâpadesa_ given in the above _vinayadesanâ_. When compared with the four-fold _vinaya_ rules, any affair in favor of the suitability should be decided as “this affair is suitable.” If not in favor, then ti should be decided as “this an unsuitable affair.”

Here for the purpose of a better understanding, the decision made with reference to the four-fold _vinayamahâpadesa_ by Sañgâyana Thera, named Dhammasangâha Thera, have been extracted below.

_Anujânâmi bhikkhave sabbam phalarasam tthapetvâ dhaññaphalarasam_ (_Vi._.-3: 344). Bhikkhus … Except the paddy juice (a cordial made from paddy juice), I permit

you to have all kinds of fruit juice (a sweet drink made from the fruits).

In the above _pâli_ stanza, the Buddha has prohibited the _bhikkhus_ from drinking the juice made from seven kinds of paddy in the afternoon.
ūū
Palm fruit, coconut, domestic and mountain jackfruit, gourd, pumpkin and three varieties of cucumber and various peas and beans are treated similar to the paddy. Although the juice made from these nine kinds of fruit are not directly prohibited from drinking by the _bhikkhus_ in the vinayapâli, but are associated with the paddy the juice of which is unsuitable to drink in the afternoon. Therefore, the juice made from these nine kinds of fruits and peas and beans are not suitable for the _bhikkhus_ to consume in the

afternoon (_Vi._-_Ttha_.-3: 384 – 385).

_Anujânâmi bhimkkuhdadviek aapttâhnaa pm_._â_ _nsââlnûik aampâbnaapmâ_._n_ _pahm_._â_ _rcuoscaakpaâpnâanma_. _mm_. _o_(_Vcai_._p_-3*â*:_n_ 3*a*4*m*.4* )*m*. *adhûkapânam*.*

Bhikkhûs …. I permit you to consume (if there is evident indication of hunger among you in the afternoon) eight kinds of juice: ūmango juice, black plum juice, domestic and wild banana juice, thitmecî juice, grape juice, lotus fruit juice, phet-thet- tayaw fruit juice (_Vi_.-3: 344).

These eight kinds of juice are what the Lord has directly permitted the _bhikkhûs_ to consume. With exception of the nine kinds of fruits, the seven kinds of paddy, various kinds of peas and beans, rattan fruit juice, lemon juice, stone apple juice, and various other small fruit juices are similar to the eight kinds of fruit juices permitted. Even though the small fruit juices are not permitted directly by the Buddha, but are associated with the eight kinds permitted. Therefore, if there is a strong evidence of thirst among the bikkhûs in the afternoon, these juices can be consumed (*Vi.-Ttha.-*3: 385).

These are some instances of decisions as to whether suitable or not in case of _vinaya_, called **_suttanuloma_,** made by Sangâyanâ Mahâthera with reference to the four Mahâpadesadhamma.

**The Four-Fold _Suttanamahâpadesâ_**

The Buddha, _sammâsambuddha_, who proclaimed himself to be omniscient, pentratively knows all there is to know through _sayamabhûñâna_ without other’s help. In the year when He was to succumb to the inexorable law of change the _prinibbâna_, the Buddha was at the _Câpâla cetî_ in Vesâli State. On the fullmoon day of the month of Tapotwe (Frebruary) He determined, via _satisampazañ ñâna_, to get absorbed in the _arahattaphala phalasamâpatti_, by the three names of _âyusañkhâ_, _âyupâlaka_ and _jîvitasañkhâra_, so as to lengthen His life until the fullmoon day of Kasun (May). Determination this way is getting relieved of the _âyusañkhâra_. From that State the Buddha continued the journey until the City of Bhoga is arrived at. Here at the Ãnadâ Cetî, the Buddha preached the **Four-Fold _Suttanamahâpadesa dhamma_** to the _bhikkhus_.

**The First _Mahâpadesadhamma_**

\1. In the domain of this _sâsanâ_, if any monk claims as “this is _dhamma_ I have

heard and received right from the Lord’s mouth. This is the Doctrine; this is the _Vinaya_; and this is the discourse”.

Bhikkhus …. That claim must not be accepted nor rejected right away. Before accepting or rejecting the claim, it must be consulted word by word with the _vinaya_ and _suttana_.

When consulted this way, if the words do not agree with the _vinaya_ nor _suttana_, then it is false claim, and must be decided as “it is not the true utterings of the Buddha, this monk must have learnt erroneously from some others.” After that decision, the claim must be disregarded and ignored.

On the other hand, if the claim agrees with the vinaya and suttana when consulted, then it must be taken as “what the monk said is truly the uterrings of the Lord, he has learnt rightly.” Bhikkhus …. Note and remember the _mahâpadesa_ in the first place.

**The Second _Mahâpadesadhamma_**

Again, Bhikkhus …. If any monk claims as follows.

PAGE159

“At a certain monastry, *Sanghâ*s headed by a _Thera_ are residing. This is what I have listened to and heard right from that _sanghâ_. This is the _dhamma_; this is the _vinaya_ and this is the suttana. It is what the Buddha has admonished.”

Bhikkhus …. What the monk has said must not be accepted nor rejected at once. Before accepting or rejecting the claim, it must be consulted word for word with the _vinaya_ and _suttana_.

In doing so, if what the monk claims does not agree word for word with the _vinaya_ and _suttana_, then decide as “what this monk has claimed is not the true utterings of the Buddha; he must have erroneously learnt it. Bhikkhus …. If the decision has been made that way, then condone the whole affair.

On the other hand, if the claim agrees with the vinaya and suttana when consulted, then it must be taken as “what the monk said is truly the uterrings of the Lord, he has learnt rightly.” Bhikkhus …. Note and remember this second _mahâpadesa_.

**The Third _Mahâpadesadhamma_**

Once again, Bhikkhus …. In the domain of this _desanâ_, a certain monk may claim

as follows.

“In a certain monastry, many a monks Thera are staying. They include _âgamasuta_ = those who learn from listening, _adhigamasuta_ = those who learn from practice, wise and well-versed, those who got _Pâli_, _suttaabhidhammâ, vinaya_ and _mâtikâ_, by heart. I have listened to and heard right from these *Thera*s. This is the _dhamma_, this

is the _vinaya_ and this is the Lord’s discourse.”

Bhikkhus …. Do not accept or reject the claim easily. It should not be rejected nor accepted as yet. Note carefully what the monk said and consult with the _vinaya_ and _suttana_ word for word.

In doing so, if what the monk claims is not agreement word for word with the _vinaya_ and _suttana_, then decide as “what this monk has claimed is not the true utterings of the Buddha; he must have erroneously learnt it. Bhikkhus …. If the decision has been made that way, then forget the whole affair.

On the other hand, if the claim agrees with the _vinaya_ and _suttana_ when consulted, then it must be taken as “what the monk said is truly the uterrings of the

` `Lord, he has learnt rightly.” Bhikkhus …. Note and remember this third _mahâpadesa_.

In doing so, if what the monk claims does not agree word for word with the _vinaya_ and _suttana_, then decide as “what this monk has claimed is not the true utterings of the Buddha; he must have erroneously learnt it. Bhikkhus …. If the decision has been made that way, then condone the whole affair.

On the other hand, if the claim agrees with the vinaya and suttana when consulted, then it must be taken as “what the monk said is truly the uterrings of the Lord, he has learnt rightly.” Bhikkhus …. Note and remember this second _mahâpadesa_.

**The Fourth _Mahâpadesadhamma_**

Furthermore, Bhikkhus …. In the domain of this _desanâ_, a certain monk may claim as follows.

“In a certain monastry, a _Thera_ is staying. He _âgamasuta_ = he who learns from listening, _adhigamasuta_ = he who learns from practice, the wise and well-versed, who got _Pâli_, _suttaabhidhammâ, vinaya_ and _mâtikâ_, by heart. I have listened to and heard right from this _Thera_. This is the _dhamma_, this is the _vinaya_ and this is the Lord’s discourse.”

Bhikkhus …. Do not accept or reject the claim easily. It should not be rejected nor accepted as yet. Note carefully what the _Thera_ said and consult with the _vinaya_ and _suttana_ word for word.

If what the _Thera_ claims is not agreement word for word with the _vinaya_ and _suttana_, then decide as “what this _Thera_ has claimed is not the true utterings of the Buddha; he must have erroneously learnt it. Bhikkhus …. If the decision has been made that way, then forget the whole affair.

On the other hand, if the claim agrees with the _vinaya_ and _suttana_ when consulted, then it must be taken as “what the _Thera_ said is truly the uterrings of the

` `Lord. The _Thera_ has learnt rightly.” Bhikkhus …. Note and remember this fourth _mahâpadesa_. The Buddha exhorted as Bhikkhus …. Note these four-fold _mahâpadesa_.

These are the four Great Upadesa named _Suttanamahâpadesa_ as given in the _Mahâparinibbânasuttana_ (_Dî_.-2: 201 – 204).

**_Anulomakappiya_** = **_Suttânuloma_**

_Anulomakappiyam pana suttena samintemeva gahetabbam_, _na itaram_ (_Dî.-Ttha.-2: 158)._

If a certain monk claims as “This is the _dhamma_, this is the _vinaya_, and this the Buddha’s discourses” referring to

1. The Buddha,
1. The _Sanghâ_,
1. A _Thera_, or
1. The *Thera*s, then you are confronted with making decision on whether it is _dhamma_-_vinaya_ or not. This decision has to be made with refernce to the four- fold _mahâpadesa_ as to whether the claim is valid or not. Any claim in concord with the four-fold _mahâpadesa_ is to be taken as the truth. That which is irrelevent with the four-fold

` `_mahâpadas_ is not true however much the monk insists that it is.

If any talk from the other side is, after referring to the four-fold _mahâpadesa_, **_suttânuloma_**, it has to be accepted only if it is consistent with the _Pitakapâli_, called _sutta_, if not it is not accepted.

Once again, if the _Pâli_ presented by the other side, and even it has been claimed as “to have made with reference _Sañgâyanâ pâli_”, it has to be presented to and passed by the previous three _sañgâyanâs_. If it not presented to and passed in this way, then it cannot be taken as true (_Dî.-Ttha.-_ 2: 157).
ū 3. **_Ãcariyavâda_**

_Ãcariyavâdo nâma atthakathâ_ (_Dî.-Ttha.-_ 2: 158).

_Ydipi tattha tattha bhagavatâ pavattitapakinnakadesanâva atthakathâ_, _sâ pana dhamma- sañgâhakehi patthamam tîni patikâni sañgâyitvâ tassa attthaovannânupeneva vâcanâ- maggam âropitattâ “**âcariyavâdo**ti vuccati_, _âcariyâ vadanti samvanninti pâli etenâti_.

_Tenâha – **âcariyavâdo** nâma atthakathâ”ti_. _Tisso sañgîtiyo ârunhlo eva ca buddhavaca-_

_nassa atthasamvannanâbhûto katthâmaggo mahinadattherena tambapannidîpam âbhto pacchâ tambapanniyehi mahâtherehi sîhalabhâsâya tthapito nikâyantaraladdhisañkara- pariharanattham._ (_Dî_.- _Tî_.-2: 168 – 169).

At the time when the Buddha was still alive various _desanâ_ = _pâli_ admonished by the Lord himself at various occasions, called _Pakan_. _n_. _a desanâ_, is **_Ãcariyavâda_**. The

learned ones have explained it in the light of _pâlipitaka_ and named it as _atthakathâ_. Then that it is presented by the Noble *Thera*s and sonsulted with the _atthakathâ_ at the _sañgâyanâ_, and with reference to the meaing given by that _atthakathâ_ is proceeded to prescribed teaching = _vâcanâmagga_.* This *atthakathâ\* _pakinnadesanâ_ is referred to as **_âcariyavâda_** as its _pâlipitaka_ has all along been explained by _sañgâyanâ Thera_ teachers. The Reverend Mahâmahinda _Thera_ has brought that speech, triply-nominated as _âcariya_- _vâda_, _atthakathâ_ and _pakinnadesanâ_, to Sri Lanka. Lest there might be confusion with the _vâda_ of other sects, the Sri Lankan *Thera*s have translated it into Sinhalese language.

The Reverend Mahâbuddhaghosa _Thera_ condenses the repetitive explanations of _mahâatthakathâ_ = original _pakinnakadesanâ_, written in Sinhalese, based on the main theme of work. Proper _pitaka_ in relevent places are put and\* _sanvannetabbapâli_ opening _savannâ at_._t_._h_ _akathâ_ are selectively combined. In some cases are inserted the relevent *pitaka*s extracted from _Kurnudia_._t_._t_ _hakathâ_, _Mahâpaccariyaat_._t_._h_ _akathâ_ etc., prevailing at that time in Sri Lanka. In some cases still, decisions by the Great *Thera*s like _Mahâpaduma_ _Thera_, _Mahâsiva Thera_ etc. which are *attanomati*s, called _Theravâda_ mentioned and translate the Ceylon _at_._t_._h_ _akathâ_ into _mâgadhi_ language = _pâli_ language and write a new _at_._t_._h_ _akathâ_ under the title of _Sañgahaat_._t_._h_ _akathâ_. Of the four-fold _vinaya_, the third one called _Ãcariyavâda_, is no other than the _at_._t_._h_ *akathâ*s of the present days.

_Ãcariyavâdopi suttena samañtoyeva gahetabbo_, _na itaro_ (*Dî.-Ttha.-*2: 169). _Pamâdapâtthavesena âcariyavâdassa kadâci pâliyâ asansandan_._â_. _pi siyâ_, _so na_

_gahetabboti dassañto âha “âcariyavâdopi suttena samañtoyeva gahetabbo”ti_ (_Dî.-Tî.-2: 169_).

It may sometimes happen that this _âcariyavâda_ (= _pakinnadesanâ_ = _atthakathâ_) _pamâdapâttha_ (recitation negligently of the traditionally brought along _atthakathâ_, by the *Thera*s), _pamâdalekha_ (= writing and copying negligently) is not consulted with the _pitakaa_._t_._t_ _hakathâ_. Therefore, the _âcariyavâda_ is taken as true to be only when it is consistent with the _pitakaa_._t_._t_ _hakathâ_, called _sutta_, and is not to be taken true when it is inconsistent with the _pitakaa_._t_._t_ _hakathâ._

4. **_Attanomati_**

_Attanomati nâma nayaggâhena anubuddhiyâ attano patibhânam_ (_Dî.-Ttha._-2: 158). **\*Attanomti** nâma theravâdo\*. **\*Nayaagâhenâ**ti suttâdito labbhamânanay*.*a*. *ggahanena\*.

**\*Anubuddhiyâ**ti suttâdîniyeva anugatabuddhiyâ\*. **\*Attano patibhânan**ti attano eva tassa atthassa vuttanayena upatthânam*, *yathâ upatthitâ atthâ eva tathâ vuttâ* (*Dî.-Tî.-\*2: 169).

**_Attanomati_** means the *theravâda*s which are the essence of knowledge acquired by means of own analytical way following the three early methods called the _sutta_, _suttâ- nnuloma_ and _âcariyavâda_. Expecially the exhortations, described in the _atthakathâ_ by the great famous *Thera*s, **\*Mahâpadumatheravâda**, **Mahâsumatheravâda\***, **_Mahâsivathera- vâda_** etc. are associated with this*\*\* fourth *vinaya* called *attanomati\*.

**_Attanomati pana sabbadubbalâ_**, _sâpi suttena samantâyeva gahetabbâ, na ittarâ_ (*Dî.- Ttha.-*2: 158).

**\*Sabbadubbalâ puggalassa** sayam patibhânabhâvato*. *Tathâ ca sâpi gahetabbâ, kîdisî?\*

` `_suttena samantayevâti yojanâ_ (*Dî.-Tî.-*2: 169).

Thinking of the various *Thera*s, the *vâda*s, called the _attanomati_, are few and far from complete. Therefore, the _attanomati_ also consulted with _pitakapâli_, referred to as the _sutta_, and is taken to be true only when consistent with it and rejected if it is inconsis- tent.

Because it has the essence of knowledge acquired by means of own analytical way following the three early methods called the _sutta_, _suttâ-nnuloma_ and _âcariyavâda_, the _theravâda_, called _attanomati_, is taken to be far from being complete. However incomplete it may be, if _attanomati_ is consistent with _pitakapâli_, referred to as _sutta_, it must be accepted.

This all there is to it with respect to the **four pillars of _sâsanâ_**, named the four- fold _vinaya_, which the people of good intension willing to attain _nibbâna_ must respect- fully be aware of.

**Those Who are Deviating from the _Sâsanâ_**

_Duppatipanno hi sâsanam bhidanto satthudhammasarîre pahâram deti nâma_ (_Udâna_- _atthakathâ_- 87).

` `An individual who is exercising on the practice inconsistent with the four-fold _vinaya_, referred to as the four pillars of _sâsanâ_, is said to be a _duppatipanna_. Put in another way, a person is called a _duppatipanna_ when he does not practice the right way by not following the instructions by the Buddha called _sâsanadhamma_ that is consistent with _pitakapâli_ referred to as _sutta_ the basic causes for the purpose of escaping from the suffering of the _sansâric_ circle. He is the one who is destroying the Buddha’s _sâsanâ_, and is said to be insulting the main body of the Buddha’s _sâsanâ_, besides causing dam- mage to it. This is the real easence of the above _atthakathâ_.

**_Sammâsambuddha Bhâsita Dhamma_**

The _duppatipanna_, who is wrongly practicing by taking _adhamma_ as _dhamma,_ and vice versa, has been indicated by the above _udânaatthakathâ_ to be causing damage to the _sâsanâ_. If a meditator is not satisfied with this exultation, then go through the exhortations given by the _sabbaññusammâsambhuddha_ given below.

_Ye te bhikkhave bhikkhu adhammam “dhammo”ti dîpinti. Te bhikkhave bhikkhu bahujanaahitâya patipannâ bahujanaasukhâya bahuno janassa anatthâya ahittâya dukkhâya devamanussânam. Bahuñca te bhikkhave bhikkhu apuññam pasavunti, te_

_cimam saddhammam antaradhâpinti_ (_Am_.-1: 18).

_Ye te bhikkhave bhikkhu dhammam “adhammo”ti dîpinti. Te bhikkhave bhikkhu_ _bahujanaahitâya patipannâ bahujanaasukhâya bahuno janassa anatthâya ahittâya_ _dukkhâya devamanussânam. Bahuñca te bhikkhave bhikkhu apuññam pasavunti, te_

_cimam saddhammam antaradhâpinti_ (_Am_.-1: 19).

Bhikkhus …. Certain bhikkhus have explicitly indicated the _adhamma_ to be the _dhamma_. Bhikkhus …. Then they are said to practice for the purpose of poverty, lack of peace and of disadvantages of man and *devâ*s. Bhikkhus …. They commit many a _kusala_ and will bring about the dissolution of the _sâsanâ_ (_Am_.-1: 18).

Bhikkhus …. Certain bhikkhus have explicitly indicated the _dhamma_ to be the _adhamma_. Bhikkhus …. Then they are said to practice for the purpose of poverty, lack of peace and of disadvantages of man and *devâ*s. Bhikkhus …. They commit many a _akusala_ and will bring about the dissolution of the _sâsanâ_ (_Am_.-1: 19).

**_Dhamma – Adhamma_**

According to _suttana_, the 10 classes of *kusalakammapathadhamma*s* are literally all *dhamma*, and *akusalakammadhamma*s are all *adhamma*. Similarly the following are all *dhamma\*s:

1. The Four-Fold _Satipatthâna_,
1. The Four-Fold _Sammappadhâna_,
1. The Four-Fold _Iddhipâda_,
1. The Four-Fold _Indriya_,
1. The Five-Fold _Bala_ (Five-Fold Force)
1. The Seven-Fold _Bhojjhañga_,
1. The Eight-Fold Magga (The Noble Eight-Fold Path).

These (37) classes of *Bodhipakkhiyadhamma*s are all *dhamma*s.

The following are all *adhamma*s.

1. The Three-Fold _Satipatthâna_,
1. The Three-Fold _Sammappatthâna_,
1. The Three-Fold _Iddhipâda_,
1. The Six-Fold _Indriya_,
1. The Six-Fold _Bala_,
1. The Eight-Fold _Bhojjhañga_,
1. The Nine-Fold Magga.
   ū
   The four-fold _upâdana_, the five-fold _nîvarana_, the seven-fold _anussayadhâtu_, and the eight-fold _micchattadhamma_ are all *adhamma*s ((_Am.-Ttha_.-1: 65 – 66).
   ū
   **Analyse**
   ūūūūū
   The meditator clinging for attainment of _nibbâna_ should again analyze the above

` `opening of the _atthakathâ_. A further explanation is given below.

In the four-fold _satipatthâna_, the Lord has exhorted to make effort in exercise by _vipassana, bhâvanâ, kammatthâna,_ step by step by cultivating the _samâdhi_ such as _ânâpâ_-_nassatisamâdhi,_ on _rûpa dhamma_ and _nâma dhamma_, referred to as the _kâya- vedanâ-citta-dhamma_, until _arahattaphala_ is acquired. (A broader step-wise explanation on this will be made later). This instruction is the _dhamma_.
ū
Suppose the meditator feels that the disciples cannot attain 28 classes of _rûpa_, mind and mental concomitants, and _nâma dhamma_ as expatiated by the Buddha. Then it is nothing but indicating the _dhamma_ of the Lord as the _adhamma_.

The *rûpa*s naturally arises in the form of _kalâpa_ called _rûpakalâpa_ particles. Only when these _rûpakalâpa_ particles can be analyzed will the knowledge attain the ultimate reality of the _rûpa_. It was the belief that the disciples cannot discern these _rûpa_ dhammas.
ūū
` `Further, _nâma dhammas_ naturally are formed by way of _cittaniyâma_ called the realms of life and thought process. The *nâma dhamma*s* formed along the natural course, the *cittaniyâma* at each and every moment the mind and mental concomitants naturally appear in association with each other. Within a period of wink, a flash of lightning *citta*- *khana*s arise and perish away billions of times. It is believed that disciples cannot discern this rapid formation and dissolution of the thought procesesses, together with the life- continuum *citta.\*

The words of teacher of such belief are as given below.

“Although they do not said the Lord has admonished the *rûpanâma dhamma*s the disciples cannot discern”, but what they said implies so. They do not preach that way, but what they preach implies that they do. This is kind indicating the _dhamma_ to be the

_adhamma_.

Again, the other side accepted the fact that the disciples cannot discern the _rûpa_- *nâma*s the Buddha has instructed, and instead a replacement was given as “discern the _rûpa-dhamma_ this way”, which are not from the Lord. These instructions are an attempt

to make the _adhamma_ the _dhamma_.

The Buddha once again exhorted the above 37 classes of *bodhipakkhiyadhamma*s in which are included the practice of the eight-fold path factors. Among the eight-fold path factors is included the Path of Right Concentration. These exhortations are the *dhamma*s.

` `If the meditator happens to have said that there is no need to cultivate concentration, then what he said is making the _dhamma_ and _adhamma_.
ūū
In the _Mahâsatipatthânasuttana_, the Buddha has expatiated that the First, the Second, the Third and _Fourth Jhâna Samâdhis_ are called the _Sammâsamâdhi_. (For _sensu_ _lato_, section on Why the Concentration has to be Cultivated).
ū
` `Also in the _Visuddhimagga atthakathâ_ – **_Cittavisuddhi nâma saupacârâ attha samâpattiyo_** (*Visuddhi-*2: 222) _=_ The Buddha has explained that the eight-fold _samâpatti_ together with _upacârasamâdhi_ are all _cittavisuddhi_ and it also is the _dhamma_. If the meditator said that there is no need to cultivate concentration, then what he said is making the _dhamma_ and the _adhamma_.

In _Mahâsatipatthâna Suttana_ (*Dî.-*2: 250 – 251), the Lord has said that the _First_, _Second, Third_ and *Fourth Jhâna Samâdhi*s are called the Right Concenteration. (see section on Cultivation of _Samâdhi_ is a Necessity for broader descriptions).
ū
Also in _Visuddhimaggaatthakathâ_ – **_Cittavisuddhi nâma saupacârâ attha samm- âpattiyo_** (*Visuddhi-*2: 222), it has been expounded that the eight-fold _samâpatti_ together with _upacârasamâdhi_ are the _cittavisuddhi_ (the purity of mind). These exhortations and instructions are the _dhamma_. Suppose a meditator is of the idea that it is not necessary to cultivate concentration, then it is indicating the _dhamma_ as the _adhamma_.

Again in _Mahâsatipatthâna Suttana_ (*Dî.-*2: 239), the Buddha expounded, for the attainment of _Arahattaphala_, to concentrate on the _rûpa_-_nâma_-cause-result-_sankhâra dhamma_ groups of the five-fold aggregate named _Khandhapabba_ in section on _Dhammâ- nupassanâsatipatthaâna_. Here too, it is the _dhamma_ involved in four-fold _satipatthâna_. The Buddha has analytically exhorted these five-fold *khandhâ dhamma*s after acquiring the Knowledge of Omniscience following the four *asankheyya*s and a million of universe and fullfilling the 30 species of the 10 *pâramî*s. If a meditator has said that the disciples cannot discern on these five-fold *dhamma*s (= _rûpa_-_nâma_), and made a remark as “These are the descriptive *dhamma*s”. The what he said is no other than turning the _dhamma_ into _adhamma_.
ūū
If a meditator makes a remark as “These are the descriptive *dhamma*s, and in practice in the mediatation centres, concentration is made this way,” then it also is a kind of making the _dhamma_ an _adhamma_. Because it has been expatiated by the Omniscient _sammâsambuddha_ himself in **_Aparijânana Suttana_** (_Sam_.-2: 249 – 250) that if the five- fold clinging aggregate = _rûpa_-_nâma_ *dhamma*s are not known analytically by three _pariññâ paññâ_, then there is no end to the suffering of the _sansâric_ circus.

Again in **_Anattalakkhana Suttana_** etc. of various *teparivutta dhamma desanâ*s, the Buddha has instructed to meditate on the past five-fold *khandhâ*s and the future five- fold *khandhâ*s. Throughout the _Khandhavaggasamyutta pâli_ and in various _nikâya_ too, such exhortations have been made,wherever pertinent, for hundreds of times. It also is the _dhamma_. If a meditator, for instance, has said that the _vipassanâ_ exercise must not and should not be made on the past and future factors, then it is a clear indication of the _dhamma_ to be an _adhamma_.
ū
Indeed, _vipassanâ_ is the meditation work on the three general characters, taking each in turn as the object, of the five-fold clinging aggreagtes = _rûpa_ and _nâma_ *dhamma*s of the past, future and present located in the _santâna_ within and without. The medi- taion is made as below –

_So kâlena ijjhattam sammati, kâlena bahiddhâ_ ( *Abhi.-Ttha.-*1: 270).

_So kâlena rûpam sammati, kâlena arûpam_ (*Abhi.-Ttha.-*1: 271).

1. At times on the internal five-fold aggragates,
1. At times on the external five-fold aggragates,
1. At times on the _rûpa dhamma_, ūū
1. At times on the _nâma dhamma_. It is not work one can do as one wishes by

discerning on the _paññatti_ grossly without differentiating and without undestanding the _paññatti_ and _paramatha_ separately.

In _Mahânidâna Suttana_ (_Dî._-2: 47 – 60), the Lord has again expounded that with- out penetrative realization, by _anubodha ñâna_ and _pativedha ñâna,_ of the _paticca- samuppâda_, the causal relationship, one cannot overcome the suffering of the sansâric circus.

` `Openings in the great _atthakathâ_ too (*Visuddhi-*2: 221*; Abhi.-Ttha.-*1: 189), have definitely given as “the cycle of life (arising and perishing away of life), referred to as the causal-relationship the _paticcasamuppâda_, is continually torturing the sentient beings like thunderbolt. No one has ever dreamed of the fact that unless it is eradicated by a knife- like _ñâna_ sharpened on a whet stone-like _samâdhi_ can anyone be relieved from the sansâric circus of sufferings. These exhortations and instructions are all the _dhamma_.

Furthermore, the distinct arising of the resultant present five-fold *khandhâ*s such as _viññâna_, _nâma-rûpa_, _salâyatana_, _phassa_, _vedanâ_ because of the past causes such as _avijjâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, _sañkhâra_ and _kamma_ cultivated during the previous existence. Because of the present causes such as _avijjâ_, _tahnâ_, _upâdâna_, _sañkhâra_ and _kamma_ cultivated during the present existence, the future resultant five-fold *khandhâ*s such as _viññâna_, _nâma-rûpa_, _salâyatana_, _phassa_, _vedanâ_ would clearly arise. Only when these are realized penetratively in their true nature by the _anubodhaññâna_ and _pativedhañâna_, will the causal relationship, the _paticcasamuppâda_ factors be understood.

In this case, the assertion the past five-fold *khandhâ*s refers to just a part of the five-fold *khandhâ*s. In the same way the present five-fold *khandhâ*s and the future five- fold *khandhâ*s refer to just a portion of the five-fold *khandhâ*s respectively. Therefore, the nature of causal relationship, the _paticcasamuppâda_, cannot be dissociated with the five-fold *khandhâ*s of the past and future. It is not a phenomenon that can be discerned separately from the past-future five-fold *khandhâ*s.

` `Therefore, if a meditator accepts the fact that the past-future phenomena should not be discerned, then the penetrative discerning of the _paticcasamuppâda_ by one’s own self would be nonsense for him in practical works. If the meditator agrees with this assertion, then he is indicating the _dhamma_ as an _adhamma_.

If a meditator stated that “the past-future five-fold *khandh*âs cannot be realized penetratively by one self via _paccakkhañâna_, can be known speculatively only via the _anumânañâna_,” then he is indicating the _dhamma_ as an _adhamma_. It is because the Noble Ones penetratively realized the causal relationship by both the _anumânañâna_ and the _pativedhañâna_.

_Sotâpannânañca nâma paccayâkâro uttânakova hutvâ upatthâti_ (*Dî.-Ttha.-*2: 83).

In accordance with the Buddha’s exhortation in _Añguttorapâli_ (*Am.-*1: 18 – 19), the act of asserting the _dhamma_ to an _adhamma_ means causing suffering and disturbance of peace among the sentient beings and perishing away of the Buddha’s _sâsanâ_. If the meditator does not wish to be one causing the perishing of the _sâsana_, all he has to do is to indicate the _dhamma_ as the true _dhamma_, and to practice in accordance with the true _dhamma_.

The meditator should remember the case of the monk Kapila, during the period of the Lord _Kassapa_, who has taken the _dhamma_ as _adhamma_ and the _adhamma_ as the _dhamma_. The meditator should carefully examine the _patipatti_ practice he is exercising and explaining (to others) if they are relevent to the four-fold _vinaya_, especially to the _pitaka_ named _sutta_. If the meditator recognizes definitely that the _patipatti_ practice he is exercising is inconsistent with the Buddha’s _pitaka_, then he must be bold enough to easily discard the practice. If not, the meditator will be one of those who are damaging the right way of practice of the _sâsanâ_.

**_Bikkhusuttana_**

_Tassamâ tiha tvum bhikkhu âdimeva visovehi kusalesu dhammesu. Ko câdi kusalânam dhammânam, sîlañca sivisuddham ditthi ca ujukâ. Yato kho te bhikkhu sîlañca suvisud- dham bhvissati, ditthi ca ujukâ. Tato tvum bhikkhu sîlam nissâya sîle patitthâya cattâro_

_satipatthâne tividhena bhâveyâsi_ (_Sam_.-3: 124).

**\*Ditthî**ti kammassakatâditthi* (*Sam.-Ttha.-\*3: 234).

My son bhikkhu …. So in the framework of this _sâsanâ_, purify the _kusala_ _dhamma_ to begin with. The where is the beginning of the *kusala dhamma*s? They are the pure morality* and *kammassakatâ*, the right understanding, called the straightforward view which understands the *kamma\* and it consequences.

My son bhikkhu …. At times in your _santâna_ may arise good and pure morality and _sammassakata_, the right understanding, referred to as straightforward view. Then, on the basis of, and grasping firmly on, the morality cultivate the foru-fold _satipatthâna_ by way the three pehnomena –

1. Internal,
1. External,
1. Internal-external (_Sam_.-3: 124).

Relevent to these *desanâ*s, the first and foremost prerequisite for **a monk of an auspicious night** is the (_sîla_) morality. The second prerequisite is the _samâdhi_ (concen- tration). The third is the knowledge acquired through practice on the basis of any one of the four-fold _satipatthâna_, of the _ânâpânassatisamâdhi_ etc., following the instructions given by the Buddha. For a meditator competent with morality, practice must be made so as to be competent with _samâdhi_, but before going on to it, explanation will be made first as to **why concentration has to be cultivated**.\*\*
