beings, similarly he himself  also possesses that nobility of wealth of wholesome person, called  faith,  virtue,  general  knowledge,  liberality,  wisdom,  etc.."  are  performed  and frequently reflected and developed, or 

**(3.4.4.J.vii) *upasamānussati*** 

by  which  the  noble  qualities  of  *nibbāna*,  i.e.,  “as  those  kinds  of  defilements  which  are removed by even full absorption (*jhānasamāpatti*), cannot be appeared for 60 to 70 years, those defilements are always freeing in eternal peace of present time (*sa-upādisesa nibbāna*)” etc.,  are  frequently  reasoned  and  developed,  the  factor  of  enlightenment  of  zest  can  be appeared apparently. 

As a worldling usage, “*samuddo mayā* *dittho* = I see the ocean”, in which partial of the ocean seen by eye is metaphorical usage on total ocean which cannot be seen, is present, similarly, partial *sańkhāra dhamma*, defilements which are removed for a long time by full absorption, can be used as metaphorically for all *sańkhāra dhamma* which are totally ceased in eternal peace, by taking the object of that kind of tranquillity, *upasamānussati* must be practiced systematically, explained in commentary. Owing to presence of ability to remove defilements for a long time, the intention (*manasikāra*) of practice of *upasamānussati*, which is produced by  knowledge that is  knowing for  long time tranquillity of partial *sańkhāra* *dhamma*, can also achieve the neighbourhood concentration. Owing to fulfilling the zest by functioning  neighbourhood  concentration,  it  is  a  cause  of  occurrence  of  factor  of enlightenment of zest. (*M-ṭī*-1-388) 

**(3.4.4.J.viii) *lūkhapuggalaparivajjanatā* = to be a person who always avoids from gross-**

**minded person** 

In the continuum of *meditator* who always avoids gross-minded person who is similar to chaff by showing apparently on his streak which lacks obedience to see pagoda, bodhi tree and senior *Mahā* *Thera*s who are leaders of the community of *samghā*; who lacks any trace of faith (*saddhā*), similar to dusts attaching on the back of donkey, due to absence of paying respect to triple gems, the factor of enlightenment of zest can be appeared apparently. (*M*- Com-1-300) 

**(3.4.4.J.ix) *siniddhapuggalasevanatā* = to be a person who always associates with soft-**

**minded person** 

In the continuum of *meditator* who always associates with soft-minded persons who have great respect on *saddheyyavatthu* which are deserving to pay respect, the Buddha etc., who have gentleness with full of faith, the factor of enlightenment of zest can be appeared.

Thus  it  must  be  enhanced  depressing  mind  by  means  of  developing  factors  of enlightenment, wisdom, effort and zest, when the mind fells back in practice. This is the fourth kind of *appanākosalla*. 

5. **Suppress on mind properly** 

For such period the mind of meditation of *meditator* become wandering and unrest due to some factors such as presence of predominant effort, predominance in knowledge of fear and zest etc. At that time, if it is well developed on factors of enlightenment, tranquillity, concentration, equanimity, but not on factors of enlightenment, wisdom, effort, zest, it can be said the unrest mind is suppressed properly.

Those *bhikkhus* replied that “Supreme Buddha… it will not be deserved to extinguish fire in this way”.

The reason why, it is not proper time to develop those factors is that *bhikkhus* the mind  of  meditation  is  active  and  wandering  to  take the  object  of practice  and  falls  into laziness. It is incapable of extinguishing on active and wandering mind by those three kinds of factors.

*Bhikkhu*s I would like to preach that the mindfulness, indeed, is essential for all time when depression or unrest of the mind occurs. 

In this case, there is specific cause for occurrence of *passaddhisambojjhańga* etc., and it  must  be  recognized  that  way  of  developing  those  factors  of  enlightenment, *passaddhisambojjhańga*  etc.,  by  means  of  fulfilling  occurrence  of  that  respective  causes. Here it would be presented previously on the way found in Pāl i Text.

Explanations  found  in  above  commentaries  and  sub-commentaries  will  be  further explained as follow: 

*yonisomanasikāra* = Wise attention 

In those words found in Pāl i Text, in the continuum of that *meditator*, factors of enlightenment, tranquillity, concentration and equanimity were well appeared previously by means of such modes. Taking into heart those objects (sign of full concentration … etc.) which  occurred  by  means  of  occurrence  of  those  factors  of  enlightenment,  tranquillity, concentration, equanimity, after well recognized on that mode, is called ***yonisomanasikāra*** (wise  attention)  for  above  three  words  relating  to  those  three  factors  of  enlightenment, tranquillity, concentration, equanimity. 

In  the  phrase,  “**after  well  recognized  on  that  mode**”,  it  means  that  fact  that previously in the continuum of that *meditator*, if the practice has been fulfilled by means of such  mode,  three  factors  of  enlightenment,  tranquillity,  concentration,  equanimity,  were appeared in that time accordingly and those three modes, i.e., mode of experiencing of on tranquillity, mode of experiencing on concentration, mode of experiencing on equanimity, of mental concomitants associating with that that consciousness, “**must be well recognized**” and then it must be taken into heart that object (as sign of full concentration etc.,) frequently in  order  to  occur  apparently  those  factors  of  enlightenment,  tranquillity,  concentration, equanimity. (This  explanation refers to only  mindfulness of breathing  for this section.  If should be recognized on remaining practices of *samatha* and *vipassanā* similarly.) 

The meaning of sign of *samatha* 

The  preceding  concentration  which  is  acquired  by  recognizing  well  on  mode  of occurrence of concentration by taking the object of sign of full concentration is designated as **sign of *samatha*** (*samatha* *nimitta*) due to occurrence of cause of succeeding concentration of the former. Those signs of full concentration (*paṭibhāganimitta*), which are objects of that *samatha* (= concentration) , as *ānāpāna paṭibhāganimitta*, are also designated as **sign of *samatha***. 

The  wandering  of  mind  (*vikkhepa*)  which  has  various  objects,  called  unrest (*uddhacca*) is designated as *byagga*. It is right. — It is explained that the unrest (*uddhacca*) has the function (*rasa*) instability of the mind on “unique object” and it has the manifestation (*paccupaṭṭhāna*) that the nature of shaking and instability of mind on unique object, appears in the insight of *meditator*. 

Due to neighbourhood concentration and full absorption, called *samatha*, fix together with  stable  unique  sign  of  full  concentration  (as  in  *ānāpāna*  *paṭibhāganimitta*),  but  not wandering  on  various  objects,  that  concentration  (*samādhi*)  is  called  ***abyagga***.  That concentration  called  *abyagga*,  indeed,  is  called  ***abyagga*  *nimitta***,  due  to  real  cause  of occurrence of succeeding concentration. Therefore it should be recognized as “indirect  

**PAGE 406** 

way  of preaching methodology” (*pariyāya*) with regard to the phrase, *samatha* *nimittam* *abyagganimittam*. (*Sam*-Com-3-199; *Sam-ṭī*-2-418; *Mahāṭī*-1-158) 

Depended *dhamma* of *upekkhāsambojjhańga* 

Depended  *dhamma*  of  *upekkhāsambojjhańga*  are  object  *dhamma*  of  equanimity (*tatramajjhattupekkhā*)  which  is  capable  of  neutralizing  on  various  objects.  As  a  real meaning, it must be recognized that the equanimity called *tatramajjhattatā* which is capable of neutralizing the mind of meditation on either object of *samatha* or *sańkhāra* *nimitta* which is the object of *vipassanā*, is depended *dhamma* of *upekkhāsambojjhańga*. (*Sam*-Com-3-179) 

*majjhattākāra* = Mode of neutrality 

There are two kinds of modes of neutrality, 

1. *majjhattākāra* which is a kind of mode of neutrality by which the object of *samatha* or the object of *vipassanā* is taken, without taken by mode of desirable one or non-desirable one, 
1. *majjhattākāra* which is a kind of mode of neutrality by which mind of meditation can be  neutralized  on  succeeding  object  of  *samatha*  or  object  of  *vipassanā*  called  *sańkhāra* *nimitta*,  which  is  occurred  by  means  of  preceding  efficiency  of  practice  of *upekkhāsambojjhańga*. Those two kinds are essential to be known as depended objects of *upekkhāsambojjhańga*. (*Sam* - *ṭī*-2-419) 

Special Notice 

The Buddha preached on 

1. The cause of occurrence of *satisambojjhańga* as depended object of mindfulness, 
1. The  cause  of  occurrence  of  *dhammavicaya*  *sambojjhańga*  as  depended  object  of wisdom, 
1. The cause of occurrence of *upekkhāsambojjhańga* as depended object of equanimity, respectively, by means of regarding as object on these three factors of enlightenment. It is preached  as  objects  in  that  way  due  to  significant  conditioning  of  supporting  of  object (*ārammaņa* *paccaya*) of respective object for those three factors of enlightenment. 

On the other hand, the remaining factors of enlightenment, effort, zest, tranquillity, concentration,  are  conditioned  by  respective  cause  by  means  of  “supporting  as  object” (*ārammaņa*  *paccaya*)  and  “supporting  as  dependence’  (*upanissaya  paccaya*).  Especially, supporting  as  dependence  is  extremely  essential  to  be  conditioned  for  those  factors  of enlightenment. Therefore the Buddha preached those factors of enlightenment, effort, zest, tranquillity, concentration by means of either object condition or  

**PAGE 407** 

dependence condition, and this is special notice to be understood, indeed. 

**Short point to be recognized** 

Owing to developing concentration by taking the object of sign of full concentration which is very bright in stage, the *meditator* must take into heart by means of … 

1. mode of experiencing on tranquillity of mind and mental concomitants, 
1. mode of experiencing on concentration on that sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing, 
1. mode of experiencing on neutrality of meditation on that sign of full concentration without falling on two extremities, retardation of mind on that sign and wandering mind, in order to occur apparently three factors enlightenment, tranquillity, concentration, equanimity. It must be  recognized  that  taking  into  heart  in  that  way  is  called  wise  attention  (*yoniso manasīkāra*). This is the way of suppressing the mind in accordance with the Pāl i Text. Then  it  would  be  presented  the  way  of  suppressing  the  mind  in  accordance  with commentary. 

**(3.4.5.E) Seven factors of occurrence of *passadhi sambojjhańga*** 

*api  ca  satta  dhammā  passaddhisambojjhańgassa  uppādāya  samvattanti paņītabhojanasevanatā*,  *utusukhasevanatā*,  *iriyāpathasukhasevanatā*,  *majjhattapayogatā*, *sāraddhakāyapuggalaparivajjanatā*,  *passakkhakāyapuggalasevanatā*,  *tadadhimuttatāti*. (*Visuddhi Magga*-1-130; *Dī*-2-382; *M*-Com-1-300,301; *Sam*-Com-3-199) 

These seven factors,… 

1. to be a person who always takes superior food 
1. to be a person who has favourable climate 
1. to be a person who has favourable  deportment 
1. to be a person who has diligence which situates on the neutrality 
1. to be a person who always avoids from those persons with stress 
1. to be a person who always associates with those persons with tranquillity 
1. to be a person who has inclination toward the occurrence of *passaddhisambojjhańga*, 

are causes of *passaddhisambojjhańga* apparently. 

**PAGE 408** 

1. ***paņītabojanasevanatā* = to be a** **person who always takes superior food** 

Owing  to  agility,  elasticity,  and  adaptability  of  physical  condition  by  taking favourable  and superior foods with high nourishment moderately, after knowing on present situation  of  body  of  *meditator*,  can  be  occurred,  it  is  a  cause  of  occurrence  of *passaddhisambojjhańga*. (*Mahāṭīkā*-1-158) 

2. ***utusukhasevanatā* = to be a person who has favourable  climate** 

In  the  continuum  of  *meditator*  who  has  favourable  climate,  agility,  elasticity, adaptability of both physical and mental condition can be occurred by that favourable climate among low temperature (*sīta utu*) and high temperature (*uhņa utu*). That temperature benefits the  *meditator*  by  means  of  great  dependence  condition  (*upanissaya*).  Thus, *passaddhisambojjhańga* would be appeared apparently in the *meditator* who has favourable  climate. (*M*-Com-1-301, *Mahāṭīkā*-1-158) 

3. ***iriyāpathasukhasevanatā* = to be a person who has favourable  deportment** 

Owing to occurrence of agility, elasticity, adaptability of both physical and mental condition in the continuum of *meditator* who has favourable  deportment, among four types of deportments, reclining, sitting, standing and walking, that favourable  deportment is cause of occurrence of *passadhi sambojjhańga*. (*Mahāṭīkā*-1-158) 

Such person called great gentleman (*mahā purisa*) is quite resistant to all climate conditions. It is not intended to say ‘these favourable climate, favourable  deportment’ for that kind of person called great gentleman. There are two kinds of factors, favourable climate (*sabhāga  utu*),  favourable  deportment  (*sabhāga  iriyāpatha*)  and  unfavourable  climate (*visabhāga utu*), unfavourable deportment (*visabhāga iriyāpatha*) for a such *meditator*. If that kind of *meditator* avoids unfavourable ones and has favourable ones, in the continuum of that *meditator*, *passaddhisambojjhańga* can be occurred apparently. (*Dī*-Com-2-383; *M*-Com-1- 301; *Sam*-Com-3-199) 

Owing to capable of fulfilling the adaptability of mind of meditation by means of finishing  to  fulfil  adaptability  of  physical  condition  resulting  from  taking  favourable  nourishment (*bojana sappāya*), favourable climate (*utu sappāya*) and favourable  deportment (*iriyāpatha sappāya*), these factors are causes of two kinds of tranquillity, tranquillity of mental concomitants (*kāyapassaddhi*), tranquillity of consciousness (*citta passadhi*). (*Sam*-*ṭī*- 437,438) 

**PAGE 409** 

4. ***majjattapayogatā*  =  to  be  a  person  who  has  diligence  which  situates  on  the neutrality** 

The  way  of  reasoning  that  ‘both  himself  and  others  have  only  *kamma*  as  their properties’, can be called *majjhatta payoga* (= a kind of diligence which situates on the neutrality). One kind of reasoning that ‘various kinds of happiness and suffering have no dependence’ (*ahetuka*) is an extremity. One kind of reasoning that ‘all the occurrences are created by the creator (*issara*), great brahma, etc… ‘which rely on abnormal dependence is also  an  extremity.  These  are  called  inferior  *dhamma*.  Without  approaching  to  these  two extremities,  the  way  reasoning  called  right  view  (*sammādiṭṭhi*)  that  ‘various  kinds  of happiness  and  suffering  would  be  occurred  in  accordance  with  their  properties,  *kamma* accordingly’ is called middle way of practice (*majjhima paṭipadā*). Therefore the person with *payoga* (diligence) which is a belief on *kamma* and *kamma* result can be designated as the person with *majjhatta payoga*. 

[**Notes:** ***payoga*** means diligence by which a way of reasoning called right view, firm faith in ***kamma* and *kamma* result**, intended to be occurred in himself.] 

It is right. — This kind of faith called ***majjhatta payoga***, due to occurrence of cause of tranquil body which  is called the body had  finished to remove worries, is capable of carrying  out  both  two  kinds  of  tranquillity,  tranquillity  of  mental  concomitants  and tranquillity of consciousness. (*Dī*-Com-2-383; *Sam*-Com-3-199; *Sam*-*ṭī*-2-438) 

If it is able to take into heart that he feels mentally agreeable feeling due to presence of wholesome *kamma*, whenever it is seen him with mentally agreeable feeling, or he feels mentally disagreeable feeling due to presence of unwholesome *kamma*, whenever it is seen him with mentally disagreeable feeling; that kind of taking into heart (reasoning) is called wise attention (*yoniso manasīkāra*) and it is also called ***majjhatta payoga*** (middle way of diligence).  It  can  be  observed  practically  on  whether  tranquillity  of  mind  and  mental concomitants occur in the continuum of a person with wise attention and middle way of diligence or not. In the continuum of a person with middle way of diligence, therefore, factor of enlightenment of tranquillity can be occurred apparently. 

Thus it should be recognized that the commentary explained on ‘avoiding from those persons with stress and associating with those persons with tranquillity’, as the factors of occurrence of *passadhi sambojjhańga* due to the reason that *majjhatta payoga* is capable of functioning tranquillity of mind and mental concomitants for the *meditator*. (*Sam- ṭī*-2-438) 

5. ***sāraddha puggala parivajjanatā* = to be a person who always avoids from those persons with stress —** 

Such person usually wanders by torturing others with weapons, sticks, stone etc. In the continuum of a *meditator* who always avoids from that kind of person with both physical and mental stress, … 

**PAGE 410** 

6. ***passaddha kāya puggala sevanatā* = to be a person who always associates with those persons with tranquillity** 

in  the  continuum  of  *meditator*  who  always  associates  with  a  person  who  has restrained controlling faculties and tranquil mind and body, … and 

7. ***tadadhimuttatā* = to be a person who has inclination toward the occurrence of *passadhi sambojjhańga*** 

in the continuum of *meditator* who has inclination toward and firm faith in order to occur tranquillity of mind and mental concomitants of every deportments, reclining, sitting, standing and walking, …  

The factors of enlightenment of tranquillity (*passaddhisambojjhańga*) can be occurred apparently.

*ekādassa  dhammā  samādhisambojjhańgassa  uppādāya  samvattanti  vatthuvisadatā*, *nimittakusalatā*,  *indriyasamattapaṭipādanatā*,  *samaye  cittassa  niggahaņatā*,  *nirassādassa cittassa  saddhā-samvegavasena  sampahamsanatā*,  *sammāpavattassa  ajjhupekkhanatā*, *asamāhitapuggalaparivajjanatā*,  *samāhitapuggalasevanatā*,  *jhānavimokkha- paccavekkhaņatā*, *tadadhimuttatāti*. (*Visuddhi Magga*-1-131) 

These eleven factors, 

1. to be a person who keeps clean both internally and externally, 
1. to be a person who has fulfilment  to balance five controlling faculties 
1. to be a person who is mastery of sign (*nimitta*) 
1. to be a person who suppress his mind in proper time 
1. to be a person who enhance his mind in proper time 
1. to be a person who can satisfy his mind lacking happiness by means of faith and knowledge of fear 
1. to be a person who can neutralize mind of meditation which is harmonious on the object 
1. to be a person who avoids from those persons without concentration 
1. to be a person who associates with those persons with concentration 
1. to be a person who always reflects absorption (*jhāna*), etc., called *vimokka dhamma* 
1. to be a person who has inclination toward the occurrence of *samādhisambojjhańga*, 

are causes of the occurrence of *samādhisambojjhańga*. (*Visuddhi Magga*-1-131) 

[**Notes:** — 

**PAGE 411** 

It  should  be  recognized  on  factor  1  and  2  as  mentioned  in *dhammavicayasambojjhańga* previously. These two factors are able to occur wisdom as well as  concentration.  This  is  because  the  fact  in  (*Abhidhamma*-Com-1-162),  that  *samāhi  to yathābhūtam jānāti passatīti vacanato samādhi tassa padaṭṭhānam* . = Owing to the Buddha preached that ‘the person with concentration knows and sees actually and really, and the concentration  is  the  proximate  cause  of  wisdom,  only  when  the  concentration  has  been fulfilled can the wisdom be fulfilled. (*Sam- ṭī*-2-438)] 

3. ***nimitta kusalatā* = to be a person who is mastery of the sign** 

It means to be a person who is mastery of learning to sign (*nimitta*). (*Dī*-Com-2-383; *Sam*-Com-3-199) 

Due to unavoidable condition of mastery of making sign of *kasiņa* and mastery of practicing on *kasiņa* and then mastery of protecting sign of *kasiņa*, also depends on mastery of practicing on *kasiņa*, the commentator explained that ‘***nimitta kusalatā***’ means to be a person who is mastery of learning to sign (*nimitta*). (*Sam- ṭī*-2-438) 

**It should be recognized as *nidassana naya*** — 

***kasiņanimittassā**ti  ca  nidassanamattam  daṭṭhabbam*.  *asubhanimittassāpi  hi  yassa kassaci jhānuppattinimittassa uggahaņakosallam nimittakusalatā evāti*. (*Dī*-*ṭī*-2-332) 

In this case, it should be recognized on the phrase, ‘to be a person who is mastery of the sign’, which is intended to show an example, as *nidassana* method (= a kind of writing or preaching methodology in which significant sample is shown to be easily understood). It is because the fact that for a such *meditator* who had attained any kind of sign which can produce neighbourhood  or full absorption, such as sign of repulsiveness (*asubha nimitta*) etc., mastery of learning, developing, protecting of the sign is also called *nimitta kusalatā*. (*Dī*-*ṭī*-2-332; *Mahāṭīkā*-1-154) 

**Special Notice —** 

This is only the stage of developing concentration by taking the object of sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing. Therefore that brilliant sign of full concentration belongs to various signs of *samatha*. It should be recognized that if the *meditator* is mastery of learning, developing and protecting in that sign of *samatha*, he is mastery of sign (*nimitta* *kusalatā*).  Therefore  the  *meditator*  must  fulfil  in  order  to  become  mastery  of  learning, developing, protecting in sign of full concentration successively. 

**PAGE 412** 

4. ***samaye cittassa niggahņanatā* = to be a person who suppress his mind in proper time** 

The mind of meditation becomes wandering and unrest as dispersing ashes when a stone falls on heap of ashes due to these reasons — 

1. to be a person with extreme diligence, 
1. to be a person with strong wisdom 
1. zest is extremely apparent. 

After that time, unrest mind must be suppressed by developing, 

1. factor of enlightenment of tranquillity 
1. factor of enlightenment of concentration 
1. factor of enlightenment of equanimity. (*Dī*-Com-2-383; *Sam*-Com-3-200; *Sam- tī*-2- 439) 
5. ***samaye cittassa paggahņanatā* = to be a person who enhance his mind in proper time** 

The mind of meditation becomes retarded and fall back from taking the object of *samatha* or *vipassanā*  due to these reasons — 

1. to be a person with very diminished diligence, 
1. to be a person with weak wisdom 
1. presence of deficiency  of mindfulness called *appamāda* which is unforgetting the object of *samatha* or *vipassanā* . 

At that time, retarded mind must be enhanced and sped up by developing, 

1. factor of enlightenment of wisdom, 
1. factor of enlightenment of effort, 
1. factor of enlightenment of zest. (*Dī*-Com-2-383; *Sam*-Com-3-200; *Sam- ṭī*-2-438) 
6. ***samaye  sampahamsanatā*  =  to  be  a  person  who  can  satisfy  his  mind  lacking happiness by means of faith and knowledge of fear** 

Owing  to  either  the  weakness  of  the  wisdom  which  is  able  to  know  and  see penetratively the real nature of the objects of *samatha* and *vipassanā*, or the absence of attainment of tranquillity from heat of defilements, the mind of meditation lacks pleasurable interest  in  practice  resulting  in  lacking  taste  of  practice.  At  that  time  the  mind  must  be dreaded by reasoning on eight kinds of dreaded-bases (*samvega vatthu*). (*Dī*-Com-2-383,384; *Sam*-Com-3-200; *Visuddhi Magga*-1-131) 

**PAGE 413** 

It is right. — ‘Donation (*dāna*) is signified by greedlessness (*alobha*), while the virtue is signified by hatelessness (*adosa*), the practice, by non-delusion (*amoha*) called wisdom (*paññā*) which is knowing and seeing the real nature of objects of *samatha* and *vipassanā*. Among those three *dhamma*, for such time the non-delusion is week, at that time the *samatha* practice is incapable of functioning to attain neighbourhood  or full concentration for both preceding and succeeding practices successively. If the practice is *vipassanā*, it is incapable of functioning to attain the Supra-mundane *dhamma* called the Path-Knowledge and Fruit- Knowledge for both preceding and succeeding *vipassanā*  practices successively. As a kind of nourishment which is not prepared with special flavours in order to become delicacy, is not satisfied by a man, the practice which is not so strong in wisdom, is unable to be favoured  by a *meditator*. Therefore any kind of practice which is unfavourable  in that way, lacks taste of pleasurable interest for that *meditator*. Owing to lack of right way of usual practice without taste of pleasurable interest, it cannot be attained tranquillity from heat of defilements called *upasamasukha* for any period, momentarily (*tadańga*), for long time (*vikkhambhana*), or for permanently  without  remains  (*samuccheda*).  At  that  time,  the  mind  must  be  dreaded  by reasoning on eight kinds of dreaded-bases. That kind of reasoning is a kind of psychiatry. (*Sam- ṭī*-2-439) 

It is right. —  If the usual practices of *samatha* and *vipassanā* occurs by cascade function  of  preceding  and  succeeding  concentration,  that  of  preceding  and  succeeding *vipassanā*  knowledge successively, the succeeding concentration and *vipassanā*  knowledge become powerful in order to perform significant absorption *dhamma* called neighbourhood  and full concentration and the Supra-mundane *dhamma* called the Path-Knowledge and Fruit- Knowledge  due  to  presence  of  conditioning  of  preceding  concentration  and  *vipassanā*  knowledge by means of repetition (*āsevana*) and dependence (*upanissaya*) conditions. When it appears in that way, the mind of meditation is capable of functioning pleasurable interest and tranquillity from heat of defilement called *upasamasukha*. If it is incapable of functioning in that way, the mind lacks taste of the practice. At that time the mind of meditation must be enhanced by means of 

1. **faith** (*saddhā*) and 
1. **great fear** (*samvega*). (*Visuddhi Magga*-1-131; *Mahāṭīkā*-1-158) 

**PAGE 414** 

**Efficiency of Faith** 

*ratanattayaguņānussaraņena  ca  pasādam  janati*,  *ayam  vuccati*  “***samaye sampahamsanatā***”*ti*. (*Sam*-Com-3-200; *Dī*-Com-2-384) 

The purification of mind must be occurred by recollection of noble qualities of triple gems. According to this explanation, these three kinds of practices, 

1. **recollection of the Buddha** 
1. **recollection of the Doctrine of the Buddha** 
1. **recollection of the Community of Noble Disciples**, 

must be fulfilled in proper time in order to occur purification of mind and faith. 

In this way, by means of occurring the knowledge of fear and purification of mind and faith, making pleasurable interest of mind of meditation is called ‘to be a person who can satisfy  his  mind  lacking  happiness  by  various  means  in  proper  time’  (=  *samaya sampahamsanatā*). (*Sam*-Com-3-200; *Sam- ṭī*-2-440) 

[**Notes:** — In this stage, if the knowledge which is knowing and seeing brilliant sign of  full  concentration,  is  not  so  powerful,  that  concentration  of  practice  is  incapable  of functioning in order to occur full absorption. Without knowing real object of sign of full concentration  by  penetrative  knowledge,  if  the  practice  of  mindfulness  of  breathing  is endeavoured, it will be lacked with pleasurable interest for the *meditator*. If a *meditator* endeavours practice of mindfulness of breathing without knowing and seeing the sign of in- breath and out-breath called *ānāpāna nimitta* and brilliant sign of full concentration which occurs depending upon in-breath and out-breath, the way of practice falls into wrong path. The reason is that only when three kinds of signs, sign of *ānāpāna* (in-breath and out-breath) and  sign  of  full  concentration  (*paṭibhāga  nimitta*)  are  thoroughly  known  and  seen  by penetrative knowledge, can it be said true practice of mindfulness of breathing. If the way of practice  is  wrong,  tranquillity  of  mind  from  heat  of  defilements  cannot  be  occurred successively. At that time, the mind of meditation must by happy by means of faith and 

knowledge of fear.] 

**Eight kinds of dreaded-bases (*samvega vatthu*)** 

1. *jāti dukkha* = the suffering of rebirth 
1. *jarā dukkha* = the suffering of old age 

**PAGE 415** 

3. *byādhi dukkha* = the suffering of decaying 
3. *maraņa dukkha* = the suffering of death 

[These four kinds can be found in both two kinds of sensuous worlds, happy existence (*sugati bhava*) and woeful existence (*duggati bhava*)] 

5. *apāya dukkha* = the suffering of woeful existence 
1) the suffering of hell, five kinds of bondages etc. 
1) the suffering of hungry ghost, scarcity of food etc. 
1) the suffering of animal world, torturing of each others, 

[These  five  kinds  are  counted  commonly  for  sufferings  depending  on  present existences of various beings] 

6. *atīte vaṭṭa mūlaka dukkha* = the suffering of cyclic results which were experienced 

in previous time, caused by previous cyclic *dhamma* of defilements and *kamma*, 

7. *anāgate  vaṭṭa  mūlaka  dukkha*  =  the  suffering  of  cyclic  results  which  will  be 

experienced in future, caused by present cyclic *dhamma* of defilements and *kamma*, 

8. *paccuppanne āhārapariyeṭṭhi mūlaka dukkha* = the suffering of searching for food 

in present life. (*Visuddhi Magga*-1-131; *Dī*-Com-2-384) 

[**Notes:**  —  Among  those  beings  who  exist  depending  upon  nourishment,  it  is explained so as to refer human beings who exist depending upon actively acquired results (***uṭṭhānaphalūpa jīvino***). That kind of suffering of those beings is specific one which is not concerned with those beings, beings in the hell, heavenly beings etc., who exist depending upon passively acquired result (***kamma phalūpa jīvi***). Thus it is designated as eight kinds of dreaded-bases, it should be recognized in that way.] (*Sam- ṭī*-2-440; *Mahāṭīkā*-1-159) 

**PālHi Text and Commentary (*aṭṭhakaṭhā*)** 

In the PālNi Text of *Dhammasańgaņī*, it is explained that ‘*samvejaniyam ṭhānanti jāti jarā byādhi maraņam* (*Abhi*-1-264) = there are four dreaded-bases, rebirth, old age, decaying and death’. 

*cattārimāni  bhikkhave  bhayāni*,  *katamāni  cattāri*,  *jātibhayam  jarābhayam byādhibhayam maraņabhayam*, *imāni kho bhikkhave cattāri bhayāni*. (*Ańg*-1-436) 

It is explained four kinds of disasters, disaster of birth, disaster of old age, disaster of decaying and disaster of death, in *Catukka Nipāta*, *Ańguttara Nikāya*, 1-436. 

Due to occurrence of depending upon **present life**, these five kinds , birth, old age, decaying,  death  found  in  PālNi  Text  and  suffering  of  woeful  existence,  explained  by commentators as fifth kind, are designated as *paccuppanna vaṭṭa mūlaka dukkha* = suffering of cyclic results which are experiencing in recent time, cause by previous cyclic *dhamma* defilements and *kamma*. 

*Atīte vaṭṭa mūlaka dukkha* means those sufferings of birth, old age, decaying, death and woeful existence which will be occurred depending upon **past life**. 

*Anāgate  vaṭṭa  mūlaka  dukkha*  means  those  sufferings  of birth,  old  age,  decaying, death and woeful existence which will be occurred depending upon **future life**. 

**PAGE 416** 

In the continuum of *meditator* who reflects those sufferings, birth, old age, decaying, death and woeful existence, of previous and future existences, by means of knowing and seeing by the knowledge on previous existences (*jātissara ñāņa*) or listening from others, the knowledge of fear (*samvega ñāņa*) can be developed. The prince of Temiya, a previous life of Bodhisatta, after knowing and seeing both suffering of woeful existence of previous and future one if he has misconducts of king’s authority, the knowledge of great fears had been occurred.  That  knowledge  of  great  fears  encouraged  significantly  him  to  renounce  the worldly  life.  Then  numerous  devotees  who  listening  about  venerable  Kapila  Thera  who destroyed  the  Noble  Doctrine  of  the  Kassapa  Buddha,  reasoned  sufferings  of  woeful existences of past, present and future existences of Kapila Thera, resulting in developing knowledge of great fears. *mahājano samviggo hoti lomahaṭṭhajāto* (*Dhammapada*-Com-2- 330) 

Thus  when  it  is  lacking  taste  of pleasurable  interest  in  the practice  due  to  either presence of weak  knowledge which is able to know and see penetratively real nature of objects  of  *samatha*  and  *vipassanā*,  or  absence  of  tranquillity  of  mind  and  mental concomitants from heat of defilements, called *upasamasukha*, the mind of meditation must be dreaded by reasoning these eight kinds of dreaded-bases (*samvega vatthu*). Then the mind will be enhanced in the practice appreciatively. Then the mind of meditation must be purified by recollecting noble qualities of Triple Gems. If the *meditator* fulfils in this way, he can be said as a person who can satisfy his mind lacking happiness by means of faith and knowledge of great fear. 

7. ***sammāpavattassa ajjhupekkhanatā* = to be a person who can neutralize mind of meditation which is harmonious on the object \_\_\_\_** 

For such time, due to lack of retardation and wandering of mind, the way pf practice which takes the object of sign of full concentration, is right and called *sammā paṭipatti*. By means depending upon that right way of practice, the mind of meditation \_\_\_\_ 

1. lacks retardation to take the object of practice due to lack of extremity of three kinds of  factors  of  enlightenment,  *passaddhi*,  *samādhi*,  *upekkhā*  which  are  associating *dhamma* of laziness 
2. lacks wandering due to lack of extremity of three kinds of factors of enlightenment, *dhammavicaya*, *vīriya*, *pīti*, which are associating *dhamma* of unrest (*uddhacca*) 
2. does not lack of pleasurable interest due to presence of fulfilment  of wisdom which is knowing  and  seeing  penetratively  by  object  of  *ānāpāna  paṭighāga  nimitta*,  and attainment of tranquillity from heat of defilements called *upasamasukha*, and 

**PAGE 417** 

4. it is no need to enhance the mind of meditation due to lack of retardation of practice of mindfulness of breathing. 

Due to lack of wandering of mind of meditation from the object of practice, it is no need to suppress object of practice, it is no need to suppress the mind. Due to presence of pleasurable interest in the practice, it is no need to perform the function of satisfying the mind. Due to these reasons the mind of meditation leads to the right way of the practice called full concentration. 

In other words, due to presence of mind of meditation which is able to neutralize on the object of *ānāpāna paṭibhāga nimitta*, it is neither retardation nor wandering mind but leading to right way of practice with happiness. At that time, as a stage-coach driver has no special preparation to drive well-trained-horses which are harmonious running along the road, the *meditator* has no need to perform three kinds of functions, enhancing, suppressing and enjoying  the  mind  of  meditation  alternatively.  At  that  time  the  *meditator*  who  has  no preparations of above three kinds, can be said a person who can neutralize mind of meditation which is harmonious on the object. (*Visuddhi Magga*-1-131; *Dī*-Com-2-384; *Sam*-Com-3- 200; *Mahāṭīkā*-1-159; *Sam- tī*-2-440) 

8. ***asamāhita puggala parivajjanatā* = to be a person who avoids from those persons without concentration** 

Avoiding from those persons who have never experienced to walk the path of practice which  is  the  cause  of  absorption,  called  ***nekkhamma  paṭipadā***;  who  lack  any  kind  of concentration, neighbourhood  and full concentration; who always endeavouring  various functions which are 

**PAGE 418** 

incapable of reaching to any kind of concentration, neighbourhood  and full concentration; who have dispersing minds which are thrown on various kinds of objects, is called *asamāhita puggala parivajjanatā*. (*Visuddhi Magga*-1-131, *Dī*-Com-2-384; *Sam*-Com-3-200; *Mahāṭīkā*- 1-159) 

9. ***samāhita puggala sevanatā* = to be a person who associates with those persons with concentration** 

Approaching and associating with those persons who have well experience to walk the path of practice which is the cause of absorption, called *nekkhamma paṭipadā*, who have concentration  which  is  well  concentrated  mind  putting  upon  the  object  of  practice  of neighbourhood  and full absorption, such as sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing,  is  called  *samāhita  puggala  sevanatā*.  (*Visuddhi  Magga*-1-131;  *Dī*-Com-2-384; *Sam*-Com-3-200) 

10. ***jhāna vimokkha paccavekkhaņatā* = to be a person who always reflects *vimokkha dhamma*, the first absorption, etc …** 

Due  to  those  *jhānic  dhamma*,  the  first  absorption,  etc.  are  well  delivered  from opposite *dhamma*, those *jhānic dhamma* are also called *vimokkha*. 

The modes of reflecting of those *vimokkha dhamma*, such as, 

1. it would be developed in this way, 
1. it would be entered in this way, 
1. it would be put strong determination in this way, 
1. it would be emerge from absorption in this way, 
1. it would be unpurified in this way, 
1. it would be purified in this way, etc… 

are called *jhāna vimokkha paccavekkhaņatā*. (*Mahāṭīkā*-1-158) 

**11.  *tadadhimuttatā* = to be a person who has inclination toward the occurrence of *samādhisambojjhańga*** 

The  occurrence  of  a  person  who  has  the  mind  which  intends  to  occur  the concentration, four kinds of deportments, reclining, sitting, standing, walking, must be put through with regard to concentration; with inclination toward concentration; with intention to bend concentration; with willingly bend concentration; is called *tadadhimuttatā*. It can be said that the full absorption has been fulfilled continuously. In the continuum of *meditator* who practices in accordance with eleven factors occurrence of *samādhisambojjhańga*, this *samādhisambojjhańga* will be appeared apparently. 

When  the  Path-Knowledge  called  *arahatta*  *magga  ñāņa*  has  attained *samādhisambojjhańga* would be improved the climax stage with the result that the *arahatta magga* becomes factor of fulfilment  of the practice. (*Visuddhi Magga*-1-132; *Dī*-Com-2-384; *Sam*-Com-3-200) 

**PAGE 419** 

**Important point to be noticed well** 

In the PālNi Text, *Samyutta*-3-92, it is preached that if wise attention is frequently performed  on  *samatha*  *nimitta*,  *abyagga*  *nimitta*,  such  as  *ānāpāna*  *paṭibhāga*  *nimitta*, *samādhisambojjhańga* can be occurred apparently. 

As mentioned above, the causes of occurrence of *samādhisambojjhańga* are explained in detail in commentaries. According to those PālNi Texts and commentaries, if the *meditator* wants to attain *nibbāna*, it must be fulfilled *samādhisambojjhańga* appreciatively. Only when seven kinds of factors of enlightenment are completely fulfilled, and only when eight kinds of noble Eight-fold Path are completely fulfilled, can the *meditator* face with *nibbāna* indeed. If the *meditator* is unwilling to develop concentration and accepts the fact that it is not essential to develop concentration, it cannot be completed seven kinds of factors of enlightenment, eight kinds of noble Eight-fold Path thoroughly. It must be reasonably assumed whether or not the Supra-mundane *dhamma* called *nibbāna* can be reached by those sex kinds of factors enlightenment, seven kinds of Noble Eightfold Path lacking the concentration (*samādhi*). It is the most important point to be noticed well not to reject the Buddha and the Noble Doctrine of the Buddha actually. 

**(3.4.5.G)Five factors of occurrence of *upekkhāsambojjhańga*** 

*pañca  dhammā  upekkhāsambojjhańgassa  uppādāya  samvattanti  sattamajjhattatā*, *sańkhāramajjhattatā*,  *sattasańkhārakelāyanapuggalaparivajjanatā*,  *sattasańkāramajjhatta- puggalasevanatā*, *tadadhimuttatāti*. (*Visuddhi Magga*-1-131; *Dī*-Com-2-384; *M*-Com-1-302; *Sam*-Com-3-200) 

These five factors, … 

1. to be a person who can neutralize on beings 
1. to be a person who can neutralize on *sańkhāra* *dhamma* 
3. to  be  a  person  who  always  avoids  those  persons  with  attachment  on  beings  and *sańkhāra* *dhamma* 
3. to be a person who associates with those persons who can neutralize on being and *sańkhāra* *dhamma* 
3. to be a person who has inclination toward occurrence of *upekkhāsambojjhańga*, 

are causes of occurrence of *upekkhāsambojjhańga*. 

1. ***sattamajjhattatā* = to be a person who can neutralize on beings** 

By means of these two factors, 

**PAGE 420** 

1) ***kammassakatā paccavekkhaņa*** = reasoning on proper wealth of oneself as *kamma* — You have reached this existence of human being because of *kamma* and then you will 

be  going  to  the  future  existence  because  of  *kamma*.  This  person  have  also  reached  this existence of human being because of *kamma* of himself, and then he himself will also be going to the future existence because of *kamma*. Whom do you attach well?’ etc., by means of reasoning in this way, or 

2) ***nissatta paccavekkhaņa*** = reasoning as occurrence of non-being — 

‘In  the  aspect  of  ultimate  sense,  there  is  no  being.  (It  means  that  there  are  only corporeality, mentality, causes and results or heap of *sańkhāra* *dhamma* only.) Whom do you attach  well?’  etc.  by  means  of  reasoning  in  this  way,  it  can  became  a  person  who  can neutralize on beings. (*Dī*-Com-2-384; *M*-Com-1-302,303) 

2. ***sańkhāra* *majjhattatā* = to be a person who can neutralize on *sańkhāra* *dhamma*** By means of these two factors, 
1) ***asāmika bhāva paccavekkhaņa*** = reasoning as the occurrence of not-owner — 

“this robe will be occurred as either change and alteration the colour gradually by the time it is dressing well, or finally it will be deserving to abandon by throwing away with a walking stick after decaying as doormat. If the owner of this robe is present, it should not be allowed to damage that robe in this way”, thus by means of reasoning, or 

2) ***tāvākālikatā  paccavekkhaņa***  =  reasoning  as  the  nature  of  occurrence  of  temporary moment — 

“this robe is not sturdy, but it has the nature of occurrence of temporary moment during using as dress” etc., thus, by means of reasoning, it can be became a person who can neutralize on *sańkhāra* *dhamma*. [It should be recognized on other requisites, bowl, etc. Similarly and those various kinds of requisites are designated as *sańkhāra*.] (*Dī*-Com-2-385; *M*-Com-1- 303; *Sam*-Com-3-200,201) 

Especially, the lust (*rāga*) is opposite to the equanimity (*upekkhā*). The equanimity, therefore, can be designated as the “path of purification of lust” for persons with heavy lust. (*Sam- ṭī*-2-440) 

3. ***satta sańkhāra kelāyana puggala parivajjanatā* = to be a person who always avoids those persons with attachment on beings and *sańkhāra* *dhamma*** 
1) ***satta kelāyama*** = The person who attach on beings — 

The *meditator*, if he or she is layman or laywoman devotee, attaches strongly his or her children, as  

**PAGE 421** 

my son, my daughter. If he is *bhikkhu*, he attaches strongly his disciple or friend who is the same ordination teacher, as my disciple, my friend etc. He himself makes those functions of that disciple or friend, such as shaving, washing, dying, baking the bowl etc. When they are out of his view a moment, he always looks for them that “where is this *sāmaņera*? Where is this *bhikkhu*?” etc., as a shaking deer. If other person requests to come that *sāmaņera* or that *bhikkhu*, he never allow them to go and complains that ‘I, myself never urge him to do even my work due to afraid of he tired, do you want to take that *sāmaņera* or that *bhikkhu* in order to be tired of him?’ etc. This kind of person is called *satta kelāyana* (the person who attaches on beings). 

2) ***sańkhāra kelāyana*** = the person who attaches on *sańkhāra* — 

A person attaches strongly on various requisites, robe, bowl, cup, walking stick, etc., as ‘mine’, ‘mine’. It is not allowed to others even touching on those requisites. Although it is borrowed for just temporary moment only, he always replies that ‘even I myself never use willingly this good due to strong attachment on it, why it can be borrowed you’. This kind of person is called *sańkhāra* *kelāyana* (= the person who attaches on requisites). 

In the continuum of *meditator* who avoids from those persons who strongly attaches on beings or requisites, the factor of enlightenment of equanimity can be occurred apparently. (*Dī*-Com-2-385; *Sam*-Com-3-210) 

4. ***satta sańkhāra majjhatta puggala sevanatā* = to be a person who associates with those persons who can neutralize on beings and *sańkhāra*** 

A person has the nature of neutrality on those beings and *sańkhāra* which are two kinds of desirable-bases for others. This kind of person is called a person who can neutralize on beings and *sańkhāra*. In the continuum of *meditator* who associates with that kind of person who can neutralize on beings and *sańkhāra*, *upekkhāsambojjhańga* can be occurred apparently. (*Dī*-Com-2-385; *Sam*-Com-3-201) 

5. ***tadadhimuttatā*  =  to  be  a  person  who  has  inclination  toward  occurrence  of *upekkhāsambojjhańga*** 

In  the  continuum  of  a  person  who  has  inclination  toward  the  occurrence  of  that *upekkhāsambojjhańga* for every deportment, reclining, sitting, standing, walking, the factor of  enlightenment  of  equanimity  can  be  appeared  apparently.  When  the  Fourth  Path- Knowledge  called  *arahatta  magga  ñāņa*  has  attained  *upekkhāsambojjhańga*  would  be improved  the  climax  stage  with  the  result  that  the  *arahatta*  *magga*  becomes  factor  of fulfilment  of the practice. (*Dī*-Com-2-385; *Sam*-Com-3-201) 

The  *meditator*  who  is  capable  of  occurring  these  *passaddhisambojjhańga*, *samādhisambojjhańga*, *upekkhāsambojjhańga* apparently by means of fulfilling these factors mentioned  above,  it  can  be  said  he  develops  three  kinds  of  factors  of  enlightenment, tranquillity, concentration, equanimity. By means of occurring and developing these three factors enlightenment thoroughly as mentioned  

**PAGE 422** 

above, the mind must be suppressed in proper time. (*Visuddhi*-1-131) 

These explanations are related to ten kinds of ***appanā kosalla dhamma*** of which **serial number 5**, how to suppress the mind proper time has been explained in detail. Then remaining kinds of ***appanā* *kosalla* *dhamma* would be continued**. 

6. ***yasmim samaye cittam sampahamsitabbam, tasmim samaye cittam sampahamseti* = the mind must be joyful when it is time to be joyful** 

It should be recognized on this sixth kind of *appanā* *kosalla* as the sixth cause of occurrence of *samādhisambojjhańga*, ‘*samaye sampahamsanatā*’ (= to be a person who can satisfy his mind lacking happiness by means of faith and knowledge of fear), mentioned above. 

7. ***yasmim samaye cittam ajjhupekkhitabbam, tasmim samaye cittam ajjhupekkhati* = the mind must be neutralized when it is time to be neutralized** 

It should be recognized on this seventh kind of *appanā* *kosalla* as the seventh cause of occurrence of *samādhisambojjhańga*, ‘*sammāpavattassa ajjhupekkhanatā* (= to be a person who can neutralize mind of meditation which is harmonious on the object), mentioned above. 

It should be recognized on these three kinds of *appanā* *kosalla*, 

8. ***asamāhita puggala parivajjanatā* = to be a person who avoids from those persons without concentration**, 
8. ***samāhita puggala sevanatā* = to be a person who associates with those persons with concentration**, 
8. ***tadadhimuttatā* = to be a person who has inclination toward the occurrence of *samādhisambojjhańga***,** 

as  mentioned  in  **serial  numbers  8**,  **9**,  **11**  of  eleven  causes  the  occurrence  of *samādhisambojjhańga*.  The  *meditator*  should,  therefore,  fulfil  these  10  kinds  of  *appanā* *kosalla* *dhamma* as explained in detail above. 

11. **Benefits of 10 kinds of *appanā* *kosalla*** 

If the *meditator* is capable of fulfilling these 10 kinds of *appanā* *kosalla* by taking the object of sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing, the full absorption (*appanā jhāna*) will be appeared certainly in the continuum of that *meditator*. 

Unless that full absorption occurred in the *meditator* who practices in this way, he should not give up his diligence but continue to practice appreciatively so as to be become wise and wholesome person. 

There  is  none  of  person  who  has  attained  the  Supra-mundane  *dhamma*  after abandoning of right  

**PAGE 423** 

effort called *sammāvāyāma*. 

After reflecting on the occurrence of mind of meditation, i.e., retarding to take the object of practice and wandering from the object of practice etc., the wise *meditator* must therefore yoke frequently harmonious functions of effort and concentration. 

The mind of meditation which reaches to a situation with slightly retardation must be enhanced in order to balance controlling faculties, factors of enlightenment. By means of prohibiting not to occur mind with predominant effort, harmonious functions of effort and concentration must be occurred. 

In accordance with the olden commentaries in which explained five kinds of similes, i.e., mode of some insects, honey bee etc., on the pollen; or on the surface of lotus leaf or in the spider’s web or in the boat, by means of escaping the mind of meditation from two extremities, retardation and wandering then yoking after balanced effort and concentration, the mind of meditation should be driven and fulfilled to lead the sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing. (*Visuddhi*-1-132) 

12. ***nimittābhimukhapaṭipādana* = Drive leading to *ānāpānapaṭibhāga nimitta*** 

It  should  be  driven  the  mind  of  meditation  leading  to  sign  of  full  concentration  of mindfulness of breathing. 

In  above  passage  of  explanation,  the  following  similes  can  give  rise  to  clear interpretation. 

When an **un-clever bee** that is incapable of determining by knowledge, knows the blooming time of a tree and flies swiftly to there, due to reaching beyond that blooming tree and returns back again, it reaches after pollens are finished at all. 

When other un-clever bee that is incapable of determining by knowledge, also knows the blooming time of a tree and flies very slowly to there, it also reaches after pollens are finished at all. 

When a clever bee that is capable of determining by knowledge, knows the blooming time of a tree and flies by steady speed to there, due to reaching just in time well, it brings pollens and makes honey well with the result that the bee can feel taste of honey. 

**PAGE 424** 

When those disciples of a surgeon practise to dissect lotus leaf inside the water, for an **un-clever disciple** who is incapable of determining by knowledge, due to putting the knife on the leaf very rapidly, either the leaf would be divided into two parts or the knife would be sunk in the water. 

When other disciple who is incapable of determining by knowledge, practices to dissect in that way, due to afraid of dividing into two parts and sinking down the knife after passed through the leaf, it is not dared to even touch the lotus leaf. 

The clever one who is capable of determining by knowledge; shows precise dissection on lotus leaf by a steady hand, due to presence of mastery of surgery and get a lot of wealth. 

When the king announces that if a such person can bring spider’s thread which is about 8 yards long, that person must win £400 in prize money, an **un-clever man** who is incapable of determining by knowledge spins rapidly spider’s thread resulting in breaking up of thread in some places. 

The other un-clever man who is incapable of determining by knowledge, does not dare touch the spider’s thread due to afraid of breaking up the thread. 

When the clever one who is capable of determining by knowledge spins steadily the spider’s thread by a stick, he wins the prize well. 

When an **un-clever captain** who is incapable of determining by knowledge, sails the boat to undesired place due to lack of controlling ability to sail in the heavy storm. 

The other un-clever captain who is incapable of determining by knowledge, anchors the boat at the present place without sailing any more although the steady wind blows. 

When  the  steady  wind  blows  a  clever  captain  who  is  capable  of  determining  by knowledge, sails with the help of all sails and when the storm is coming, he sails with the help of an half of sails, he is able to reach desired place. 

**PAGE 425** 

When the teacher claims that ‘if a such person is capable of pouring the oil into a bottle with narrow opening without flowing the oil out of the bottle, he will win the prize’, for an **un-clever disciple** who is incapable of determining by knowledge, due to pouring the oils rapidly, oils are flowed outside the bottle. 

For other un-clever  disciple who is incapable of determining by knowledge, due to afraid of flowing oils outside bottle, does not dare to pour into the opening of the bottle. 

A clever disciple who is capable of determining by knowledge, pours the oil into the opening of bottle by means of steady effort, and wins the prize. 

Similarly, when the brilliant sign of concentration appear, if a **such *bhikkhu*** tries hard strenuously in order to reach the full absorption rapidly, the mind of meditation will usually be fallen into one extremity of unrest (*uddhacca*); due to predominant effort. 

Other *bhikkhu*, on the other hand, due to knowing disadvantage of strenuous effort, reasons that ‘which benefit will be occurred by the full absorption’, after the sign of full concentration appeared, and diminishes the effort to reach the full absorption. Due to falling the mind of meditation on other extremity of laziness (*kosajja*), that *bhikkhu* is also unable to reach the full absorption. 

Such practising *bhikkhu* is capable of driving the mind of meditation leading to the sign of full concentration with the help of harmonious functions of effort and concentration after escaping the mind of meditation from two extremities, retardation of the mind to take the  object  and  wandering  of  the  mind.  That *bhikkhu*  is  able  to  reach  the  full  absorption certainly. It should be occurred for every *meditator* as that *bhikkhu* who has efficiency to reach the full absorption. (*Visuddhi Magga*-1-133,134)

13. **Whether or not it should be changed and enlarged sign of full concentration** 

*imesu  cattālīsāya  kammaṭṭhānesu  dasa  kasiņāneva  vad3d3hetabbāni*.  (*Visuddhi Magga*-1-108) 

According  to  above  explanation,  it  should be  recognized  that  among  40  kinds  of meditation subjects, ten kinds of *kasiņa* only are deserving to enlarge due to attainment of advantages  of  super-psychic  knowledge  (*abhiññāņa*).  It  is  mentioned  in  relation  with mindfulness of breathing as follows. 

*tesu hi ānāpānanimittam tāva vad3d3hayato vātarāsiyeva vad3d3hati*, *okāsena ca paricchinnam*. *iti sādīnavattā okāsena ca paricchinnattā na vad3d3hetabbam*. (*Visuddhi*-1- 109)

(*Mahāṭīkā*-1-131) 

The meaning of above quotation of commentary and sub-commentary is as follows — 

For a *bhikkhu* who enlarges the sign of concentration of mindfulness of breathing which is not deserving to enlarge, only a group of air can be enlarged because of the fact that the  sign  of  concentration  which  is  similar  to  cotton  wool,  brilliant  star  etc.,  has  the dependence of a group of air. It must be put the mind of meditation on tip of nostril or upper lip. It is limited to put the mind on only the touching place, tip of nostril or upper lip but not follow interior or exterior part of the sign. There is no significant advantage in enlarging the sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing as enlarging that of full concentration of wind-*kasiņa*. Due to presence of disadvantages of enlarging a group of air and limiting of the mind of meditation to be put on touching place only, it should not be enlarged the sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing. (*Visuddhi*-1-109; *Mahāṭīkā*-1-131) 

*phuṭṭhaphuṭṭhokāse  pana  satim  ṭhapetvā  bhāventasseva  bhāvanā  sampajjati*. (*Visuddhi*-1-271) 

- Only in the continuum of *meditator* who puts the mindfulness on the objects of in-breath and  out-breath  touching  at  the  tip of nostril or upper lip, the practice of  mindfulness of breathing can be fulfilled thoroughly. (*Visuddhi*-1-271)

**3.5 *Pathamajjhānakathā* = Explanations relating to the First Absorption** 

It would be continued to present way of practice relating to the first absorption etc., explained in the commentary called *Visuddhi Magga*. 

For  that  *meditator*  who  drives  the  mind  of  meditation  leading  to  sign  of  full concentration of mindfulness of breathing by means of harmonious functions of effort and concentration,  by  the  time  it  is  deserving  to  say  impulsions  of  the  full  absorption,  the consciousnesses  of  life-continuum  (*bhavańga*)  cease  and  the  adverting  of  mind-door (*manodvāravajjana*) arises taking the object of sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing which appears by means of developing concentration on in-breath and out-breath. After one mind moment called adverting, the fourth or five impulsions arise consecutively. Among those four or five impulsions, the last one impulsion is called impulsion of fine- material world (*rūpāvacara javana*). (*Visuddhi*-1-134)

L = life-continuum (*bhavańga*) or *bhavańga* mind clearness which benefits as a dependence of life not to occur discontinuous process of mind

L  “Sh  C  A  N  S  G  F”  L 

- **…  …  …  …  …  …  …  …** 

The way of the first experienced thought process of the first absorption is as follows. — 

After frequent discerning on the sign of full concentration (*paṭibhāga nimitta*), if it is quite close to enter the absorption (*jhāna*), the object of the sign of full concentration would be appeared in the life-continuum (= mind-door clearness) with the result that the shaking of life-continuum (*bhavańgacalana*), the cessation of life-continuum (*bhavańgupeccheda*) and the  advertence  (*manodvārāvajjana*)  arise  successively.  Then  4  times  of  impulsions  of neighbourhood   concentration  (*upacāra  samādhi  javana*),  i.e.,  the  preliminary  object (*parikamma*), the neighbourhood  impulsion of the *jhānic* state (*upacāra*), the successive (*anuloma*) and the cessation of the Sensuous Sphere called trans-lineage (*gottrabhu*), arise in the little wise person (*mandapaññavā*), while only 3 times of impulsions of neighbourhood concentration, i.e., the same as impulsions shown in little wise person, except excluding the preliminary object (*parikamma*), arise in the great wise person (*tikkhapaññavā*). After those impulsions  of  neighbourhood   concentration,  only  once  impulsion  of  full  concentration (*appanā samādhi javana*) arises and then breaking down of the mind-door thought process occurs by dropping into the life-continuum. 

1. **Impulsion of neighbourhood  concentration** 

In this cognitive process of absorption, those impulsions called preliminary object (*parikamma*), neighbourhood  impulsion of the *jhānic* state (*upacāra*), successive (*anuloma*) and  *gottrabhu*  are  called  impulsions  of  neighbourhood   concentration  (*upacāra  samādhi javana*). It means that impulsions usually occur the neighbourhood  of the absorption, the Path-Knowledge and the  Fruit-Knowledge.  It is also called impulsions  of neighbourhood  absorption (*upacāra samādhi javana*). The fourth or fifth impulsion is called impulsion of the full absorption (*appanā jhāna javana*). 

According to the explanation of the most Venerable Ledī Sayadaw, ‘**penetratively and  firmly  fixed  discerning  mind  is  termed  absorption  (*jhāna*)**’,  due  to  capable  of discerning penetratively and firmly fixed on the object, such as sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing, those impulsions of neighbourhood  and full absorption are also called  ‘***ārammaņūpanijjhāna**  jhāna*’.  Among  those  consciousnesses  of  newly  occurred cognitive process of absorption, the adverting of mind-door consists of 12 mind and mental concomitants  while  each  impulsion  consists  of  34  mind  and  mental  concomitants respectively. Way of discerning on those mind and mental concomitants will be presented in Section 5, *nāmakammaṭṭhāna*. It should be recognized that among those 34 mind and mental concomitants five factors of absorption (*jhānańga*); initial application (*vitakka*), sustained application  (*vicāra*),  pleasurable  interest  (*pīti*),  mentally  agreeable  (*sukha*)  and  one- pointedness  (*ekaggatā*)  are  also  included.  It  should  be  recognized  that  each  mental concomitant called *vitakka*, *vicāra*, etc., is termed **factor of absorption** (***jhānańga***), and those five factors of absorption commonly is termed as the ‘**absorption** (***jhāna***)’. It will be clear understood the following explanations of *Visuddhi Magga* after understanding on this basic terminological explanation. 

[**Notes:** In the *Visuddhi Magga*, it is explained on absorptions of the earth-*kasiņa* as typical one. It should be recognized in this paper that the absorptions which have the objects of the sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing as type sample.] 

2. **Nomenclature of the impulsions of full absorption** 

Among those four or five impulsions, the last one is impulsion of absorption of the fine-material  sphere.  The  remaining  three  or  four  impulsions  are  impulsions  of  sensuous world neighbourhood  absorption. 

**PAGE 429** 

1. Those impulsions of sensuous world neighbourhood  absorption are designated as the preliminary (***parikamma***) due to ability to prepare impulsion of full absorption, 
1. those are designated as the neighbourhood  (***upacāra***) due to neighbourhood  situation of the full absorption as adjacent to a village or town is called neighbourhood  of village or town etc., 
1. Those are designated as the successive (***anuloma***) due to adaptability to both previous impulsions, preliminaries which are taking the object of the sign of full concentration, and the later impulsion of the full absorption, respectively. 

After these mind moments called, *parikamma*, *upacāra*, *anuloma*, there is such third or fourth mind moment. That mind moment is designated as the trans-lineage (***gottrabhu***) due to surpassing the sensuous sphere and capable of developing fine-material sphere. 

Those remaining impulsions of three or four mind moment within the newly occurred cognitive process of full absorption except the last one have more powerful *vitakka*, *vicāra*, *pīti*, *sukha*, *ekaggatā*, than normal consciousness of the sensuous sphere. 

In these 3 or 4 kinds of mind moments for little wise person, by means of one kind of preaching methodology, 

1. the first consciousness of impulsion is called the preliminary (***parikamma***), 
1. the second consciousness of impulsion is called the neighbourhood (***upacāra***), 
1. the third consciousness of impulsion is called the successive (***anuloma***), 
1. the fourth consciousness of impulsion is called trans-lineage, due to the cessation of sensuous sphere (***gottrabhu***), 
1. the fifth consciousness of impulsion is called the full absorption (***jhānic* state**). 

In other words — (for great wise person), 

1. the first consciousness of impulsion is called the neighbourhood (***upacāra***), 
1. the second consciousness of impulsion is called the successive (***anuloma***), 
1. the third consciousness of impulsion is called trans-lineage, due to the cessation of sensuous sphere (***gottrabhu***), 
1. the  fourth  consciousness  of  impulsion  occurs  by  means  of  the  full  absorption (***jhānic* state**). 

It should be recognized on those fourth or fifth impulsion of the full absorption for the great wise person who has rapid understanding (*khippābhiññā*) and the little wise person who has retarded understanding (*dandhābhiññā*), by means of flexible nature of occurrence of the full absorption (*aniyamasabhāva*). 

After the fifth impulsion occurred, the sixth and the third impulsions fall back due to 

absence of  **PAGE 430** 

efficiency with the result that none impulsion occurs and the life-continuum arises again. (*Visuddhi*-1-134) 

3. **Only once mind moment** 

That impulsion of full absorption is **only once mind moment**. (It means that it is only once impulsion of mind moment in the first experienced cognitive process of full absorption.) It is right. — 

In these seven kinds of situations, 

1. the first experienced superior impulsion of full absorption, 
2. those impulsions of mundane super-psychic knowledge (*abhiññāņa*), 
2. four kinds of the Path-Knowledges, 
2. four kinds of the Fruit-Knowledges which occur just after the Path-Knowledges, 
2. the life-continuum of world of form and formless world, 
2. the impulsion of full absorption of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, which is able to benefit the cessation-absorption (*nirodha samāpatti*) and 
2. the fruition-absorption of the non-returnee and arahant who emerge from the cessation- absorption (*nirodha samāpatti*), there is no measurable time. 

Among these seven situations, the Fruit-Knowledge which occur just after the Path- Knowledge, never occur more than **three times** (less than two times) as a fixed law. 

The impulsions of full absorption of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, which is able to benefit the cessation-absorption never occur more than **two times** as a fixed law. 

In  the  world  of  form  and  formless  world  duration  of  the  life-continuum  is  **no measurable time**. 

In those remaining four situations, the first experienced impulsion of full absorption, the  mundane  super-psychic  knowledge,  the  Four  Noble  Path-Knowledges,  the  fruition- absorption of the non-returnee and arahant who emerge from the cessation-absorption, there is only one mind moment. 

Thus the first experienced impulsion of full absorption is only **one mind moment**, and then it falls into the life-continuum, one mind moment of advertence occurs in order to reflect  the  absorption.  Then  impulsions  which  reflect  the  absorption  arise  successively. (*Visuddhi*-1-135) 

4. **The concentration of first absorption** 

*ettavatā  ca  panesa  vivicceva  kāmehi  vivicca  akusalehi  dhammehi  savitakkam savicāram vivekajam pītisukham paṭhamam jhānam upasampajja viharati*. (*Abhi*-1-44; *Dī*-1- 69) 

**PAGE 431** 

*evamanena  pañcańgavippahīnam  pañcańgasamannāgatam  tividhakalyāņam dasalakkhaņasampannam  paṭhamam  jhānam  adhigatam  hoti*  (*ānāpānapaṭibhāga- nimittārammaņam*). (*Visuddhi*-1-135) 

As mentioned way of practice, this *meditator*, separated from the object of sensual desire  (*vatthu  kāma*)  and  defilement  of  sensual  desire  =  sensitivity  of  sensual  desire (*kilesākāma*),  avoiding  from  unwholesome  *dhamma*,  reaches  into  the  first  absorption associating  with  initial  application  (*vitakka*),  sustained  application  (*vicāra*),  pleasurable interest  (*pīti*),  mentally  agreeable  (*sukha*),  which  are  occurred  by  lack  of  hindrances (*nīvaraņa*). This *meditator* who has fulfilled with the first absorption had been attained the first absorption with the sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing; which has five rejected factors which has five fulfilled factors, three kinds of good nobilities, 10 kinds of characteristics (*Visuddhi*-1-135) 

Those objects of the sensual desire, colour, sound, smell, taste, touching, which are desirable  and  strongly  attached,  are  called  sensual  desired  objects  (***vatthu  kāma***)  due  to depended factor. The lust and attachment which desire that sensual desired object is called defilement  of  sensual  desire  (***kilesākāma***).  The  Buddha  expounded  the  words  ‘*vivicceva kāmehi*’ = ‘separated from the object of sensual desire’, in order to show the fact that during the concentration of first absorption, although those object of sensual desire and defilement of sensual desire and all unwholesome *dhamma* do not occurred apparently in the continuum of the *meditator* by means of three sub-moments, the arising (*uppāda*), static (*ṭhiti*), perishing away (*bhańga*), those sensual desires are the opposite *dhamma* of the first absorption and the latter can be attained by avoiding from the former. As is the bulk of darkness is present, the light of oil lamp is not occurred, similarly, if those sensual desires are present obviously, this *jhānic*-state can not be occurred. Those kinds of sensual desires are the opposite *dhamma* of the absorption, indeed. As if this bank is left, that bank can be reached, only when those sensual desires are abandoned (momentarily and for long time), can the attainment of that absorption be occurred. (*Visuddhi*-1-135,136) 

With regarding to the phrase, ‘***vivicceva kāmehi***’, it must be referred to both object of sensual desire (***vatthu kāma***) and defilement of sensual desire (***kilesākāma***). 

With regarding to the phrase, ‘***vivicca* *akusalehi dhammehi***’, it must be referred to five kinds of hindrances, hindrance of sensual desire (***kāmacchanda nīvaraņa***) etc. including defilement of sensual desire (***kilesākāma***). (*Visuddhi*-1-135,136) 

5. **Five kinds of hindrances (*nīvaraņa*)** 

Those  *dhamma*  which  are  capable  of  hindering  the  wholesome  *dhamma*,  the absorption, the Path-Knowledge etc., are designated as **hindrances** (***nīvaraņa***). Those are five kinds as follows. 

1. ***kāmacchanda*** = [*kāma* + *chanda*] desire and strong attachment to sensual objects. It must be interpreted on greed (*lobha*) as direct meaning. 
1. ***byāpāda*** = [*vi + āpāda*] = change to worse the mind, the cause of anger (hate). It must be interpreted on hatred (*dosa*) by which death of other would be wished, in unwholesome deeds (*akusala kammapatha*), however, in this case, it must be interpreted on all kinds of ill- will. 

**PAGE 432** 

3. ***thina*** + ***middha*** = the nature of sloth and torpor of the mind and mental concomitants. It  must  be  interpreted  on  the  mental  concomitants,  sloth  (*thina*)  and  torpor  (*middha*) respectively. 
3. ***uddhacca*** + ***kukkucca*** = the nature of unrest and worries. It must be interpreted on the mental concomitants, the unrest (*uddhacca*), worries (*kukkucca*) respectively. 
3. ***vicikicchā*** = the nature of sceptic on three noble triple gems, *kamma* and results of *kamma*, three noble trainings etc. It must be interpreted on the mental concomitant, sceptic (*vicikicchā*). 

   6. **Special notes** 

For those hindrances, *thina*-*middha* and *uddhacca*-*kukkucca*, it is counted as one kind of  hindrance  although  two  different  interpretations  are  present  because  of  the  following reasons. — 

Those hindrances, *thina* and *middha* have the same 

1. functions, retardation to take the object, 
1. causes, the laziness to take the object, and 
1. occurrence which is the opposite of effort. 

Those hindrances, *uddhacca* and *kukkucca* have the same 

1. functions, wandering of the mind on the object, 
1. causes which is hatred to destroy relatives, 
3. occurrence which is the opposite of *samatha*. 

Thus, due to presence of same **function**, **cause**, and **opposite occurrence**, the Buddha preached as commonly on those hindrances. (*abhidhammatthavibhāvinī*) 

7. **Five kinds of factors of absorption (*jhānańga*)** 
1. ***vitakka*** = the nature of initial application to the object of sign of full concentration of 

mindfulness of breathing, 

2. ***vicāra*** = the nature of sustained application to the object of sign of full concentration 

of mindfulness of breathing, 

3. ***pīti*** = the nature of pleasurable interest to the object of sign of full concentration of 

mindfulness of breathing, 

4. ***sukha***  =  the  nature  of  mentally  agreeable  feeling  to  the  object  of  sign  of  full 

concentration of mindfulness of breathing, 

5. ***ekaggatā***  =  the  nature  of  one-pointedness  of  mind  on  the  object  of  sign  of  full 

concentration of mindfulness of breathing. 

The opposite conditions of five kinds of hindrances and five kinds of these five kinds of factors of absorption are explained in *Visuddhi Magga* as follows: — 

*aññesampi ca dhammānam akusalabhāve vijjamāne* “*tattha katame akusalā dhammā*, *kāmacchando*”*tiādinā  nayena  vibhańge  upari  jhānańgānam paccanīkapaṭipakkhabhāvadassanato  nīvaraņāneva  vuttāni*.  *nīvaraņāni  hi jhānańgapaccanīkāni*,  *tesam  jhānańgāneva  paṭipakkhāni  viddhamsakāni  vighātakānīti vuttam  hoti*.  *tatthā  hi  **samādhi  kāmacchandhassa  paṭipakkho***,  ***pīti  byāpādassa***,  ***vitakka thinamiddhassa***,  ***sukham  uddhaccakukkuccassa***,  ***vicāro  vicikicchāyā**ti  peṭake  vuttam*. (*Visuddhi*-1-137) 

**PAGE 433** 

*samādhi  kāmacchandhassa  paṭipakkho  rāgappaņidhiyā  ujuvipaccanīkabhāvato*, *nānārampaņehi palobhitassa paribbhamantassa cittassa samādhānato* *ca*. *pīti byāpādassa paṭipakkhā  pāmojjena  samānayogakkhemattā*.  *vitakka  thinamiddhassa  paṭipakkho yonisosańkappanavasena  savipphārapavattito*.  *sukham  avūpasamānutāpasabhāvassa uddhaccakukkuccassa  paṭipakkham  vūpasantasītalasabhāvattā*.  *vicāro  vicikicchāyā* *paṭipakkho ārammaņe anumajjanavasena paññāpaṭirūpasabhāvattā*. (*Mahāṭīkā*-1-165) 

Although  the  occurrence  of  unwholesome  *dhamma*,  wrong  view  (*diṭṭhi*),  conceit (*māna*),  shamelessness  (*ahirika*),  fearlessness  (*anottappa*),  except  hindrances, *kāmacchandanīvaraņa*  etc.,  are  obviously  present,  in  the  *Vibhańga*  PālNi  (266),  if  it  is preached that ‘***tattha katame akusalā dhammā**,* ***kāmacchando***’ etc. in order to show the fact that  opposite  occurrence  of  factors  of  absorption  is  those  kinds  of  hindrances  as unwholesome *dhamma* only. It is right. — Those hindrances are capable of prohibiting not to occur factors absorption with the result that those are opposite *dhamma* of the latter. ‘Only factors of absorption are capable of rejecting, destroying the hindrances and these are actually opposite *dhamma* of the latter,’ thus it means in those explanation. That is right. — 

1. Due to occurrence of opposite *dhamma* of lust and capable of concentrating the mind which is wandering on  various objects after attracted by those objects, the concentration (*samādhi*)  is  opposite  of  desire  to  sensual  objects  (*kāmacchanda*).  It  means  that  due  to capable of rejecting to desire to sensual objects, the concentration is opposite of desire to sensual objects. 
2. During the pleasurable interest is occurring obviously as three momentary phases, *uppāda*, *ṭhiti*, *bhańga*, the anger is absent as three momentary present and vice versa. By the time  the  pleasurable  interest  occurs  obviously  by  taking  the  object  of  sign  of  full concentration of mindfulness of breathing, it is no ability to occur the anger in the same mind moment.  Because  the pleasurable  interest  (*pīti*)  is  opposite *dhamma*  which  is  capable  of rejecting the ill-will (*byāpāda*). 

3  Due to presence of activating efficiency by means of wise attention leading to the object  of  sign  of  full  concentration  of  mindfulness  of  breathing,  the  initial  application (*vitakka*)  is  opposite *dhamma*  which  is  capable  of  rejecting  hindrance  called  sloth-torpor (*thina-middha*). 

4. Due to presence of the nature of tranquillity and peace, the agreeable feeling (*sukha*) is  opposite  *dhamma*  which  is  capable  of  rejecting  the  hindrance  called  unrest-worries (*uddhacca-kukkucca*) which have the nature of restlessness and remorse. 

**PAGE 434** 

5. Due to presence of the same nature of wisdom by means of repeatedly discerning on the object of sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing, the sustained application (*vicāra*) is opposite *dhamma* of sceptic  and is  capable of rejecting the latter thoroughly. (*Visuddhi*-1-137; *Mahāṭīkā*-1-165) 

Both two kinds of concentration, the neighbourhood - and full-concentration takes the object of sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing. Hindrances are rejected in the field of the neighbourhood  concentration. However the significant differences between these two kinds are explained in *Visuddhi Magga*, as follows: — 

8. **Significant differences of two kinds of concentrations** 

*duvidho  hi  samādhi  upacārasamādhi  ca  appanāsamādhi  ca*.  *dvīhākārehi  cittam samādhiyati  upacārabhūmiyam  vā  paṭilābhabhūmiyam  vā*.  *tattha  upacārabhūmiyam nīvaraņappahīnena cittam samāhitam hoti*. *paṭilābhabhūmiyam ańgapātubhāvena*. 

*dvinnam  pana  samādhīnam  idam  nānākāraņam*,  *upacāre  ańgāni  na  thāmajātāni honti*,  *ańgānam  athāmajātatthā*,  *yathā  nāma  daharo  kumārako  ukkhipitvā  ṭhapiyamāno punappunam  bhūmiyam  patati*,  *evameva  upacāre  uppanne  cittam  kālena nimittamārammanam karoti*, *kālena bhavańgamotarati*. *appanāyam pana ańgāni thāmajātāni honti*,  *tesam  thāmajātatthā*,  *yathānāma  balavāpuriso  āsanā  vuṭṭhāya  divasampi  tiṭṭheyya*, *evameva  appanāsamādhimhi  uppanne  cittam  sakim  bhavańgavāram  chinditvā  kevalampi rattim  kevalampi  divasam  tiṭṭhati*,  *kusalajavanapaṭipāṭivaseneva  pavattatīti*.  (*Visuddhi*-1- 123) 

At the beginning of arising of brilliant sign of full concentration, those hindrances are rejected. Those defilements which have the same depended factor of hindrances are also deposited well. The mind of meditation is put well on the object of sign of full concentration by neighbourhood  concentration. 

It is right. — There are two kinds of concentration, the neighbourhood  (*upacāra*) and full concentration (*appanā samādhi*). 

Due to these two reasons — 

1. occurrence of far from opposite hindering *dhamma* of *jhānic* state, and 
1. reaching  to  the  stable  occurrence  of  *jhānic*  state,  during  occurring  both 

neighbourhood  and full concentration, the mind of meditation would be put well on the object  of  sign  of  full  concentration  of  mindfulness  of  breathing.  During  occurring neighbourhood  concentration, mind of meditation is put on the sign of full concentration thoroughly by removing opposite hindrances. During occurring the full concentration mind of meditation is put on the sign of full concentration and purified well by arising factors of absorption apparently. 

The significance which makes difference between two kinds of concentration is as 

follows: — **PAGE 435** 

By the time the neighbourhood  concentration occurs, factors of absorption have not full efficiency yet. As if a baby who is starting to stand up is raised, he always fall down on the ground, similarly, when the neighbourhood  concentration occurs, the mind of meditation takes the object of the sign of full concentration sometimes, and falls into the life-continuum sometimes. 

However  during  the  full  concentration  is  occurring,  factors  of  absorption  arise strongly and efficiently. As an adult strong man can stand up for the whole day, similarly, when the full concentration of absorption occurs, the mind of absorption is able to exist the whole  night  or  the  whole  day  without  occurring  the  life-continuum.  The  wholesome impulsions  of  absorption  occur  continuously  indeed.  This  is  the  significant  difference between two kinds of concentrations respectively. (*Visuddhi*-1-123) 

The commentator Sayadaw explained the phrase “the mind of absorption is able to exist  the  whole  night  or  the  whole  day”,  with  intended  to  refer  during  entering  the  full absorption (*jhānic* state). (*Mahāṭīkā*-1-148) 

9. **To be noticed** 

Above explanation of commentary, indeed, is an important point with regarding to reasonable situation for a *meditator* who wants to attain *nibbāna* in this very life. Especially during neighbourhood  concentration occurs, the mind usually falls into the life-continuum, which is noticeable explanation. If any way of practice among forty meditation subjects is fulfilled thoroughly, when the neighbourhood  concentration occurs, the mind of meditation usually falls into the life-continuum sometimes. 

When  the  concentration  is  developing  by  taking  the  object  of  sign  of  full concentration of mindfulness of breathing, and the neighbourhood  concentration occurs but not reach to the full concentration, the mind can falls into the life-continuum, sometimes. 

For every meditation subject, when the concentration is moderately developed after practiced, the mind of meditation usually falls into the life-continuum with the result that misunderstanding of most *meditator* occurs and they usually say that “it is unconscious and peaceful”. Some *meditator* usually say that “both object and consciousness would be ceased”, etc. Those kinds of *meditators* intended to say they are able to enter into *nibbāna*. 

Here, it would be presented about the consciousness of the life-continuum. 

10. **An explanation the life-continuum** 

Within a life, it is the same objects of consciousnesses of birth, life-continuum and death,  as  natural  fixed  law.  Those  consciousnesses  take  the  object  which  was  taken  by consciousnesses of impulsions of near death of adjacent previous life, but not six kinds of objects of recent life. That object of consciousnesses of impulsions of near death may be any one  of  three  signs  (*nimitta*),  ***kamma***,  ***kamma*-*nimitta***,  ***gati  nimitta***.  The  object  of consciousness of life-continuum will be apparent when it  

**PAGE 436** 

is capable of discerning on object of consciousnesses of impulsions of near death of adjacent previous  life,  generally.  In  other  words,  when  five  aggregates  of  previous  life  can  be discerned  by  insight,  those  *dhamma*  which  belongs  to  previous  five  aggregates,  i.e., ignorance (*avijjā*), craving (*tahņā*), clinging (*upādāna*), *kamma*-formation (*sańkhāra*), action (*kamma*) and object which is clanged by those *dhamma*, can be understood clearly. Only when clear understood on previous five aggregates in that way noble doctrine of relationship of dependence-origination can be scrutinized and understood by means of three kinds of full understandings (*pariññā*). 

For those *meditators* who are unable to discern both five aggregates of previous life including ignorance, craving, clinging, *kamma* formation, *kamma* and the object which is clung by those *dhamma*, it is very difficult to know the actual object of the consciousness of life-continuum. Those *meditator*, therefore, say that “they do not know any more” during the mind falls into the life-continuum continuously. That consciousness of life-continuum does not  take  various  kinds  of  objects,  such  as  the  object  of  sign  of  full  concentration  of mindfulness of breathing and none of present six kinds of objects etc. Thus those *meditators* suggest that they do not know any thing. However according to the Buddha’s scripture, it can not accept that kind of suggestion “they do not know any thing”. 

*catubhūmakacittañhi  no  vijānanalakkhaņam  nāma  natthi*,  *sabbam vijānanalakkhaņameva*. (*Abhi*-Com-1-155) 

- Every consciousness occurring in four realms, sensuous sphere, world of form, formless world,  supra-mundane  world,  which  is  incapable  of  knowing  object,  is  absent.  All consciousnesses have the nature of discriminating the object indeed. (*Abhi*-Com-1-155) 

With  regarding  to  explanation  found  in  commentary  called  *Aṭṭhasālinī*,  the consciousness  of  life-continuum,  as  it  is  also  a  kind  of  consciousness  occurring  in  four realms, is not unconscious one but knows the object which is taken by consciousnesses of impulsions of near death of previous life. 

The seeing consciousness (*cakkhu viññāņa*) knows the colour object although it is unable to know sound, smell, taste, touching and mind-object (the nature of *dhamma*). It is impossible to say that seeing-consciousness as unconscious one due to lack of ability to know remaining five-sense doors. Similarly, the consciousness of life-continuum is not deserving to say as unconscious one because it knows the object of consciousnesses of impulsions of near death of previous life. For a *meditator* who has moderately developed concentration but not full efficiency of factors of absorption, the mind of meditation is unable to support itself not to falls into the life-continuum with the result that he suggests that “he knows nothing”. But the life-continuum is a kind of conscious mind, as mentioned above. Then falling into the life-continuum continuously, is misunderstood as entering into the fruition-absorption (*phala samāpatti*). In order to be clear understood on difference between the fruition-absorption and life-continuum, it would be presented about the fruition-absorption in “*Phalasamāpattikathā*, *Nibbānagāminipaṭipadā*-Volume V”. 

**PAGE 437** 

Then it is explained in *Mahāṭīkā* the fact relating to continuous occurrence of the life- continuum and stable deportment, as follows.\_\_\_\_\_ 

11. **Why deportment (*iriyapatha*) is stable?** 

*kāmāvacare  dasa  bhavańgacittāni*,  *rūpāvacare  pañca*,  *tisso  manodhātuyo*,  *ekā vipākāhetukamanoviññāņdhātu somanassasahagatāti ekūnavīsati cittāni rūpameva janayanti*, *na iriyāpatham*, *na viññattim*. (*Visuddhi*-2-250) 

*rūpameva  janayanti*,  *na  iriyāpatham*  *nirussāhasantabhāvena  paridubbalabhāvato*. *kiriyāmayacittehi  avimissabhavańgappavattikāle  khandhādisarīrāvayavānam niccalabhāvenāvaṭṭhānam*.  *tathā  hi  abbokiņņe  bhavańge  pavattamāne  ańgāni  osīdanti paviṭṭhāni viya honti*. “*dvattimsā*”*ti pana ādinā vuttesu jāgaraņacittesu vuttamānesu ańgāni upatthaddhāni yathāpavattairiyāpathabhāveneva pavattantīti*. (*Mahāṭīkā*-2-402) 

These 19 kinds of consciousnesses, 

1. In consciousness of sensuous sphere, 10 kinds of life-continuum 
1. In consciousnesses of world of form, 5 kinds of life-continuum 
1. mind-element  (*mano  dhātu*),  3  kinds,  five-door  advertence  and  two  receivings (*sampaṭicchana*) 

4.joyful  investigating  (*santīraņa*),  1  kind  called  joyful  mind-door-consciousness-element (*manoviññāņadhātu*), without root *kamma* result, 

are able to produce pure octad with eight factor nutriment (*cittaja ojaṭṭhamaka rūpa*) only. It is unable to produce deportment (*iriyapatha*), bodily expression (*kāya viññatti*) and verbal expression (*vacī viññatti*) called special expression corporeality (*viññatti rūpa*). (*Visuddhi*-2- 250) 

The reason why they are unable to produce deportment but pure-octad only is that it lack efficiency of endeavouring  in order to occur deportment and inactive ones. 

These 32 kinds of consciousnesses, 

1. sensuous sphere great wholesome consciousnesses – 8 kinds (*kāmāvacara mahā kusala citta*) 
1. unwholesome consciousnesses – 12 kinds 
1. mind-door  adverting  and  *hasituppāda  citta*  which  are  rootless  independent  function consciousnesses – 2 kinds 
1. great independent function (*mahā kiriya citta*) – 8 kinds 
1. wholesome consciousness of world of form which is deserving to occur super-psychic knowledge (*abhiññāņa*) and independent function consciousness of fifth absorption – 2 kinds — 

are able to produce 

1. both pure-octad with eight factor nutriment 
1. four kinds of deportments, reclining, sitting, standing, walking, and 
1. bodily expression and verbal expression corporealities. (*Visuddhi*-2-250) 

**PAGE 438** 

Owing  to  carrying  out  independent  function  of  bodily  and  verbal  expression thoroughly,  those  32  kinds  of  consciousnesses  are  designated  as  independent  function consciousness (*kriyāmaya citta*). 

During pure life-continuum occur continuously without any kind of those *kriyāmaya citta*, the body is stable without any movement of bodily parts, shoulder etc. Therefore when those  consciousnesses  of  life-continuum  occur  continuously  without  associating  by  those *kiriyāmaya citta*, the appearance of bodily parts seem to be delayed and contracted. When those 32 kinds of aware consciousnesses (*jāgaraņa citta*) excluding two kinds of five-door consciousnesses  (*dvepañca  viññāņa*),  occur  successively,  the  appearance  of  the  body becomes rigid and stable deportment as it’s previous situation. (*Mahāṭīkā*-2-402) 

According to explanation of *Mahāṭīkā*, it should be recognized the fact that during consciousnesses of life-continuum is occurring continuously, the appearance of the bodily parts are stable without any movement or shaking anymore. 

12. **Very difficult acquisition** 

Among those two kinds of concentration, the neighbourhood  and full concentration, a such sign of full concentration occurs associating with the neighbourhood  concentration. It is very difficult to occur that sign of full concentration. Then if it is possible to obtain the full concentration of absorption by taking the object of that sign within one sitting period, it is very good acquisition for a *meditator*. If it is impossible to obtain the full absorption within one sitting period, the *meditator* must protect the sign of full concentration not to disappear as a chief queen protects her foetus who will become king *cakkavatim*. 

The benefit is that — for a *meditator* who protects well the sign of full concentration, the acquired neighbourhood  concentration never diminish indeed. If well protection of the sign of full concentration is absent, acquired neighbourhood  concentration (= neighbourhood  absorption) usually disappears consequently. (*Visuddhi*-1-123) 

If acquired sign of full concentration disappears, the absorption which has the object of that sign of full concentration never diminishes indeed. Due to lack of protection on the sign  of  full  concentration,  if  it  disappears,  the  acquired  absorption  would  be  finished consequently.  Because  there  is  correlation  between  the  absorption  of  mindfulness  of breathing and sign of full concentration reciprocally. (*Mahāṭīkā*-1-148) 

**PAGE 439** 

Way of protecting on sign of full concentration is those modes mentioned above and it must be fulfilled, 

1. by avoiding from seven kinds of unfavourable conditions, 
1. by association with seven kinds of favourable conditions, and 
1. by endeavouring  in accordance with 10 kinds of mastery in full absorption (*appanā kosalla*) 

If it is fulfilled in that way, in the field of neighbourhood  concentration unwholesome *dhamma*  and  hindrances  (*nīvaraņa*),which  must  be  rejected  in  the  first  absorption,  are removed thoroughly. If the concentration can be developed successively by taking the object of sign of full concentration, and  mind of  meditation is firmly  fixed on the sign of full concentration  for  one  hour,  two  hours,  etc.  The  factors  of  absorption,  initial  application, sustained application, pleasurable interest, agreeable feeling, one-pointedness, which are well associating factors of the first absorption (*sampayogańga*), will be appeared apparently. In order  to  show  that process  the  Buddha  continued  to preach  that  “***savitakkam savicāram vivekajam pītisukham paṭhamam jhānam upasampajja viharati***” = it is staying by fulfilling the  first  absorption  associating  with  pleasurable  interest  (*pīti*),  agreeable  feeling  (*sukha*), which  is  occurred  by  avoiding  from  hindrances  but  by  initial  application  (*vitakka*)  and sustained application (*vicāra*). 

13. ***vitakka-vicāra* (initial and sustained application)** 

*tattha  vitakkanam  **vitakko***,  *ūhananti  vuttam  hoti*.  *svāyam  ārammaņe  cittassa abhiniropanalakkhaņo*,  *āhananapariyāhananaraso*,  *tathā  hi  tena  yogāvacaro  ārammaņam vitakkāhatam  vitakkapariyāhatam  karotīti  vuccati*.  *ārammaņe  cittassa ānayanapaccupaṭṭhāno*. 

*vicaraņam  vicāro*,  *anusañcaraņanti  vuttam  hoti*.  *svāyam ārammaņānumajjanalakkhaņo*,  *tattha  sahajātānuyojanaraso*,  *cittassa anuppabandhanapaccupaṭṭhāno*. (*Visuddhi*-1-138) 

There is no indulgence of the ultimate *dhamma* which occur caused by respective cause,  for  any  person  or  being.  Therefore,  the  commentary  explained  that  “***vitakkanam vitakka***” = the nature of initial application is called ***vitakka*** in order to prohibit indulgent occurrence of any kind of person, being. The initial application means that “this object has this kind of nature”, etc. 

1. That *vitakka* has the characteristic of the initial application of the mind to the object. Due to occurrence of the mind applying of the object by the help of *vitakka*, the commentary explained that “*vitakka* has the characteristic of the initial application of the mind to the object”. Actually, the nature of ultimate *dhamma* lacks any kind of endeavouring  or applying (*byāpāra*).  For  instance  —  as  a  such  man  who  wants  to  visit  the  palace,  enters  into  it depending on any relative or friend who is well familiar to the king, the mind applies of the object by depending upon *vitakka*. If it is so, there is a reasonable question that how the mind without “initial application (*vitakka*)” applies on the  

**PAGE 440** 

object, it applies by means of efficiency of *vitakka*”, as an answer. As above mentioned a man, after having well practice, can enter the palace without relative or friend who is familiar to king, similarly, the mind without initial application, can apply on the object after having well practice. “After having well practice” (*paricaya*) means frequent occurring of the initial application in the continuum of mind again and again. It is right — The nature of initial application of mind on the object has been well practiced previously for a long time by means of continuous occurrence of that initial application (*vitakka*) in the continuum of mentality. Therefore the mind without initial application can apply to that object sometimes, indeed. As the mind of meditation which has well practiced to discern *sańkhāra* *dhamma* by means of three  general  characters,  due  to  occurrence  of  that  mind  associating  with  the  *vipassanā*  knowledge,  can  be  occurred  by  means  of  three  general  characters  without  associating *vipassanā*  knowledge sometimes, in other words, it should be recognized as the simile that that mind which occurs associating with defilement, although it is free from defilement for a long time, can be occurred by means of previous practice (*paricaya*) and streak of defilement. (*Mahāṭīkā*-1-166) 

2. *vitakka* has the function (*rasa*) of initial applying to the object, leading and applying to the object, repeated applying to object, applying again and again, (*āhānana pariyāhanana raso*). 

It should be recognized that the occurrence of mind by striking the object and taking into  heart  as  the  ‘in-breath’,  the  ‘out-breath’,  ‘corporeality’,  ‘corporeality’,  etc.  is  called *āhānana pariyāhanana*. (*Mahāṭīkā*-1-166) 

“Owing to presence of that function, the *meditator* make initial applying, leading and applying to the object, repeated applying, applying again and again on the object, the sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing etc. by the help of that *vitakka*”, it means in this way. 

3. That *vitakka* is manifested in the knowledge of *meditator* as “the nature of attracting and inducing the mind to the object”. 

***vicāra*** — The nature of applying the object from here to there, sustained application the object from here to there, repeated reflecting the object is called *vicāra*. It means the mind always leading to the object, wandering thoroughly to the object, and grazing again and again on the object. 

1. *vicāra* has the characteristic of the sustained application of the mind on the object, such as the sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing. 
1. *vicāra* has the function (*rasa*) of yoking the mind and mental concomitants, which occur associating each others, within the same mind moment, on the object. [It should be recognized the fact that continuous yoking of mind and mental concomitants called connected *dhamma* which occur  

**PAGE 441** 

associating each others within the same moment, occurs on the object by means of sustained application called wandering repeatedly on the object. (*Mahāṭīkā*-1-167)] 

3. That *vicāra* is  manifested in the  knowledge of *meditator* as the nature of  yoking successively of preceding and succeeding ones. 

**3.5.13.a Special notes on *vitakka* and *vicāra*** 

Although in the first absorption and some consciousnesses of sensuous sphere, it is obviously present the yoking together of *vitakka* and *vicāra*, the *vitakka* is similar to the initial sound produced by striking the bell due to both gross occurrence of the *vitakka* rather than *vicāra* and previous leading to the object. Then *vicāra* which is continuous occurrence of the mind by yoking on the object successively, is similar to sustained sound produced by striking bell due to both subtle occurrence of the *vicāra* rather than *vitakka* and presence of the nature of repeated reflecting on the object. (It is similar to soothing sound produced by echo.) 

Then in these *vitakka* and *vicāra*, due to presence of shaking, the *vitakka* is the nature which occurs by means of shivering of the mind at beginning stage, indeed. It is similar to striking downward and upward of the wigs of a bird that desires to fly up into the sky. It is also similar to leading and falling of bee that has strong attachment to smell and always follows to smell, on lotus field. 

*Vicāra*, on the other hand, has subtle nature which occurs without shivering of the mind. It is similar to stretching of wings of a bird in the sky. It is also similar to moving round slowly over the lotus field by a bee in order to investigate whether or not any kind of danger is present, after arrived on it. 

**3.5.13.b Explanation found in commentary of *Dukanipāta*** 

It should be recognized on *vitakka*, the nature of initial application of the mind on the object, as upward and downward movement of the wings of bird which flies up into the sky. “It should be recognized on *vicāra*, the nature of sustained application of the mind on the object, as steady flying by soothing movement of wings of bird in the sky”, explained in commentary of *Dukanipāta*. That explanation is reasonable during successive occurrence of preceding and succeeding ones, the neighbourhood  concentration and full concentration, respectively. Those significant nature of *vitakka* and *vicāra* are obviously apparent in the first and second absorption.(*Visuddhi*-1-138) 

The significant nature of *vitakka*, mode of initial application of the mind on object, is apparent  in  the  first  absorption  due  to  presence  of  gross  nature.  In  the  pentad  method (***pañcaka naya***), the significant  

**PAGE 442** 

nature of *vicāra*, mode of sustained application of the mind on object is apparent in the second absorption due to absence of that *vitakka*. (*Mahāṭīkā*-1-167) 

**3.5.13.c In other words** 

For a person who brushes a clear bronze cup, handling it by means of one hand while brushing it with soap, oiled goat-haired brush etc. by other hand, it should be recognized *vitakka* as one hand which firmly handles the cup. *Vicāra*, is similar to brushing hand. 

*Vitakka* is similar to pressing hand of the potter on clay while *vicāra* is similar to other hand which applying around the clay. 

*Vitakka* is similar to an iron wedge which is firmly inserted in the centre of circle on the ground, while *vicāra* is similar to other iron wedge which is applied to make circular rim. 

As  a  tree  grows  with  both  flowers  and  fruits,  a  such  kind  of  absorption  occurs associating  with  both  *vitakka*  and  *vicāra*.  This  kind  of  absorption,  therefore,  occurs associating  with  both  *vitakka*  and  *vicāra*,  (*savitakka  savicāra*),  preached  by  the  Buddha. (*Visuddhi*-1-138,139) 

Each ultimate nature, called *vitakka*, *vicāra*, *pīti*, *sukha*, *ekaggatā*, is designated as **factor of absorption** (***jhānańga***) and then that a group of factors of absorption is designated as the **absorption** (***jhāna***). 

Although  there  is  no  tree  free  from  flowers,  fruit,  foliages,  etc. people  usage  are present  that  the  tree  with  flowers,  the  tree  with  fruits,  similarly,  although  there  is  no absorption  free  from  factors  of  absorption,  *vitakka*  etc.,  the  commentator  Sayadaw  gave above simile of a tree with flowers in order to show clearly the fact that the absorption with *vitakka*, the absorption with *vicāra*, should be designated accordingly. (It means that this kind of  preaching  methodology  is  called  ***abedobedupacāra***  =  a  metaphor  by  which  different condition is presented as non-different condition.) (*Mahāṭīkā*-1-167) 

14. ***pīti*-*sukha* (pleasurable interest-agreeable feeling)** 

*pītisukhanti  ettha  pīņayatīti  pīti*.  *sā  sampiyāyanalakkhaņā*,  *kāyacittapīnanarasā*, *pharaņarasā vā*, *odagyapaccupaṭṭhānā*. (*Visuddhi*-1-139) 

Owing  to  capable  of  pleasing  and  developing  the  body,  mind  and  object,  it  is designated as *pīti* (pleasurable interest). 

1. That *pīti* has the characteristic of the pleasurable interest on object. (It means *pīti* has the characteristic of satisfaction to take the object.) 

**PAGE 443** 

2. *pīti* has the function (*rasa*) of pleasing and developing both body and mind. In other words, it has the function of spreading throughout body with superior corporealities produced by mind. [The mind of meditation associating with *pīti* can produce *cittaja rūpa* at it’s arising phase (*uppāda*) of every mind moment. Due to occurrence of those *cittajarūpa* are caused by superior mind of absorption, the formers are superior ones. Those superior *cittajarūpa* occur throughout body. It means that that kind of function is carried out by *pīti*.] 
3. That *pīti* is manifested in the knowledge of *meditator* as the nature of activating and pleasing both body and mind simultaneously. 

**3.5.14.A. Five kinds of *pīti* (pleasurable interest)** 

There are five kinds of pleasurable interest, *khuddikā pīti, khaņikā pīti, okkantikā pīti, ubbegā pīti, pharaņā pīti*. 

1. ***khuddhikā pīti*** — It is capable of setting bodily hairs up (goose flesh) only. It is a kind of *pīti* which can not occur frequently after perished away. 
1. ***khaņikā pīti*** — It is a kind of *pīti* which occurs many times in every moments, as lightening. 
1. ***okkantikā pīti*** — It is a kind of *pīti* which is embedded throughout body as the wave raising up to beach and perished away. 
1. ***ubbegā pīti*** — It is very powerful *pīti* which is capable of flying the whole body into sky as a mass of cotton wool blown by strong wind. 
1. ***pharaņā  pīti***  —  When  this  kind  of  *pīti*  occurs,  the  whole  body  is  soaked  with pleasurable interest as a bubble with full of air or as a valley which is flowed with sudden flash of rains. (It means the occurrence of spreading throughout body with superior *cittaja rūpa* produced by mind which is predominated with *pharaņā pīti*.) 

After  those  five  kinds  of  pleasurable  interest  (*pīti*)  sets  the  foetus  which  is  the dependence of tranquillity (*passadhi*) and then it is matured, with the result that two kinds of tranquillity, tranquillity of mental concomitants (*kāyapassaddhi*) and that of consciousness (*cittapassaddhi*), would be fulfilled. (It means that *pīti* takes birth the son called *passaddhi*, 

tranquillity.) 

After tranquillity (*passadhi*) sets the foetus which is the dependence of agreeable feeling (*sukha*) and  then it is matured, with the result that two kinds of agreeable feelings, bodily  agreeable  feeling  (*kāyika  sukha*)  and  mentally  agreeable  feeling  (*cetasika  sukha*) would be fulfilled. (It means that the mother called *passaddhi* takes birth the son called *sukha* again.) 

When agreeable feeling, by setting it’s foetus, becomes matured stage, three kinds of concentrations,  

**PAGE 444** 

momentary  concentration  (***khaņika  samādhi***),  neighbourhood  concentration  (***upacāra samādhi***) and full concentration (***appanā samādhi***), would be fulfilled. (It means that the son of *pīti* is *passaddhi*, while that of *passaddhi* is *sukha*, that of *sukha* is concentration that is the grandson of *pīti*.) Among those five kinds of pleasurable interest (*pīti*), a such kind called *pharaņā* *pīti* is the fundamental cause of the full concentration and it occurs associating with the  neighbourhood   concentration before  full  concentration previously.  When  it becomes improved  gradually,  such  kind  of  *pharaņā*  *pīti*  which  is  associating  with  the  full concentration  is  present.  That  kind  of  *pharaņā*  *pīti*  is  intended  to  say  *pītisukham*  which belongs to five factors of absorption, in this case. (*Visuddhi*-1-139,140) 

**3.5.15.B. Agreeable feeling (*sukha*)** 

*sukhanam  **sukham***,  *suṭṭhu  vā  khādati*,  *khanati  ca  kāyacittābādhanti  sukham*,  *tam sātalakkhaņam*, *sampayuttānam upabyūhanarasam*, *anuggahapaccupaṭṭhānam*. (*Visuddhi*-1- 140) 

- The nature of agreeable feeling is designated as ***sukha***. In other words, such nature is capable of chewing both bodily and mentally disagreeable feelings; that nature, therefore, is called *sukha*. In other words, such nature is capable of digging both bodily and mentally disagreeable feelings; that nature, therefore, is called *sukha*. 
1. That *sukha* has the characteristic of joyable nature of both the person with fulfilled *sukha* and associating mind and mental concomitants within one mind moment. (It means that *sukha* is capable of making happiness of associating mind and mental concomitants within one mind moment. Due to presence of desirable nature, *sukha* has characteristic the agreeable nature for both a person with that *sukha* and mind and mental concomitants within one mind moment.) 
1. *Sukha* has the function (*rasa*) of proliferating mind and mental concomitants which are associated *dhamma* of one mind moment. 
1. It is manifested in the knowledge of *meditator* as the nature of acceptable the object repeatedly  again  and  again.  (Disagreeable  feeling  usually  gives  up  the  object  which  is dependence of disagreeable feeling, while the neutrality feeling (*upekkhā vedanā*) neutralizes the object which is dependence of neutrality. This agreeable feeling neither gives up the object as disagreeable feeling nor neutralizes the object as neutrality feeling but ability to take the object repeatedly again and again. Thus it is manifested in the knowledge of *meditator*.) In other  words,  agreeable feeling is  manifested in the  knowledge of *meditator* as 

benefitable and improvable mind and mental concomitants which are associating with it in one mind moment. 

Although yoking occurrence of those *pīti* and *sukha* is obviously present in some *dhamma*  such  as  the  first  absorption,  the  pleasing  which  occurs  by  means  of  obtaining desirable object is called the pleasurable interest (*pīti*). The agreeable feeling of obtained object is called *sukha*. 

**PAGE 445** 

In such mind moment, the pleasurable interest is present. In that mind moment, the agreeable feeling always present. In that mind moment, the agreeable feeling is present. In that mind moment, the pleasurable interest not always present. (It  means the pleasurable interest may or not present in order to refer the third absorption of tetrad method (*catukka naya*)or the fourth absorption of pentad method (*pañcaka* *naya*), where it is yoking with agreeable feeling but not pleasurable interest.) 

*Pīti* belongs to formation-group while *sukha* belongs to feeling-group  among five aggregates (*khandhā*). 

For a traveller who travels the desert in summer with very tired sees a green forest not so far and when he hears information of another traveller of opposite direction that “there is very  fine  lake  called  *jātissara*  inside  the  forest  where  is  little  far  from  here”,  the  great satisfaction  and  pleasurable  interest  appears  in  him.  That  is  called  *pīti*.  It  should  be recognized on *pīti* as the nature of satisfaction and pleasurable interest when desirable object, like sign of full concentration is obtained, similar to those *pīti* mentioned above. When he enters into the forest, reaches under the shade of forest, drinks the water etc., the agreeable feeling occurs in him and that kind of feeling, indeed, is *sukha*. It should be recognized on *sukha* as the nature of agreeable feeling when it is felt the acquired object like that *sukha* mentioned above.  It should be recognized on those facts  mentioned above depending on various periods due to obvious occurrence of those *dhamma* in various periods. Thus due to presence of both this *pīti* and this *sukha* are present in that absorption, it would be designated as the absorption with *pīti*, *sukha*. (*Visuddhi*-1-140,141) 

The absorption with these factors of absorption mentioned above, *vitakka*, *vicāra*, *pīti*, *sukha*, *ekaggatā*, which is occurred by taking the object of brilliant sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing, is called the **first absorption**. Thus the first absorption is a kind of absorption with five factors (*pañcańgasamannāgata*), indeed. 

18. **Five factors would be rejected** 

It should be recognized on the occurrence of five factors which had been rejected, by means of rejecting five kinds of hindrances (*nīvaraņa*) which are capable of hindering not to obtain  the  absorption,  as  sensual  desire  (*kāmacchanda*),  ill-well  (*byāpada*),  sloth-torpor (*thina-middha*), unrest-worries (*uddhacca*-*kukkucca*), sceptic (*vicikicchā*), mentioned above. 

Unless  those  hindrances  are  rejected,  the  absorption  can  not  be  occurred.  Those hindrances, therefore, would be designated as rejected factors of that absorption. By the time the absorption occurs, other unwholesome deeds besides hindrances are also rejected and disappeared. However only those five kinds of hindrances are capable of making danger of absorption,  indeed.  Therefore,  it  is  explained  on  rejecting  of  five  hindrances  only (*pañcańgavippahīna*). 

The nature of desiring to various sensual objects called living and non-living ones is called *kāmacchanda* (sensual desire). That sensual desire is capable of attracting the mind by various objects. The mind which is attracted and persuaded by sensual desire can not firmly fix on one object like sign of full concentration. That mind is capable of fulfilling to obtain absorption which is  

**PAGE 446** 

surpassing that sensual desire. 

The  ill-will  (*byāpāda*)  is  also  capable  of  torturing  the  mind  on  various  kinds  of undesirable  objects.  The  mind  which  is  tortured  by  ill-will  wanders  various  undesirable objects continuously with the result that it is not stable on one object like the sign of full concentration. 

Sloth and torpor of mind and mental concomitants are also incompatible of mind of meditation which is developed by taking the object of practice like sign of full concentration. 

Unrest (*uddhacca*) which is wandering on various objects and worries (*kukkucca*) which  is  remorse  about  something  wrong  that  one  have  been  done,  are  also  capable  of torturing mind not to occur stability on one object like sign of full concentration with the result that mind of meditation is wandering about from here to there continuously. 

The nature to sceptic on three triple gems, *kamma* and results of *kamma*, and on three noble trainings called training of virtue, training of concentration, training of wisdom, is *vicikicchā*.  Especially,  in  this  stage,  sceptic  on  training  of  concentration  by  which  the concentration  is  developed  after  taken  the  object  of  sign  of  full  concentration  of  full concentration  of  mindfulness  of  breathing,  is  *vicikicchā*.  The  mind  which  is  tortured  by sceptic lacks desire to walk the path of purification which is able to attain the absorption like the practice of mindfulness of breathing. (It is recent paradox on *jhānic* state.) 

Thus it is explained on only five hindrances out of other unwholesome *dhamma*, as **rejected  factors**  (***pahānańga***)  due  to  occurrence  of  complete  opposite  to  absorption. (*Visuddhi*-1-141,142) 

19. **Five factors would be fulfilled** 

Initial  application  (*vitakka*)  is  capable  of  applying  the  mind  to  the  object,  while sustained application (*vicāra*) is capable of connecting of adjacent minds on object not to discontinue. It would be explained in detail as follow. 

Initial  application  is  capable  of  applying  the  mind  to  the  object  of  sign  of  full concentration. Sustained application is capable of sustaining the mind on the object of sign of full concentration not to discontinue mind process. 

The pleasurable interest (*pīti*) which is occurred by completion of *bhāvanā payoga* of mind is capable of making satisfying on the sign of full concentration, while the agreeable feeling  (*sukha*)  is  capable  of  proliferating  mind  and  mental  concomitants  which  are associating  with  it.  (In  this  case,  it  should  be  recognized  on  *bhāvanāpayoga*  as  those functions of initial application and sustained application.) If it is capable of making those functions, that mind associating with remaining mental  

**PAGE 447** 

concomitants, contact (*phassa*), etc., is supported by initial application to object of sign of full  concentration,  sustaining  the  mind  on  that  object,  satisfying  on  that  object  and proliferating  of  associated  *dhamma*,  which  are  functions  of  *vitakka*,  *vicāra*,  *pīti*,  *sukha* respectively. The one-pointedness (*ekaggatā*) which is associating with supported mind, is capable of setting mind of meditation up on object by means of balanced five controlling faculties, called faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom. Due to occurrence of very far from opposite hindering *dhamma*, the mind of meditation is well set on the object of sign of full concentration by means of lacking retardation and wandering of mind from the object. Therefore it should be recognized the first absorption so as to fulfilled five factors by means of obvious occurrence of there five factors, *vitakka*, *vicāra*, *pīti*, *sukha* *cittekaggatā*. 

It  is  right.  —  When  those  five  factors  occur  obviously,  it  would  be  said  “the absorption  occurs  well”.  Therefore,  it  can  be  said  those  five  factors  as  fulfilled  factors. Therefore it should not be assumed that there is other kind of absorption out of the absorption which is fulfilled with five factors, *vitakka* etc. For instance — “as if it can be designated as the soldier with four factors, the musical instrument with five factors, the Noble Path with eight factors, by means of completing partial factors respectively, similarly, by means of completing partial factors of absorption, it is designated as the **absorption which is fulfilled with five factors of absorption**”, it must be recognized in this way. (*Visuddhi*-1-142) 

Those five factors of absorption, indeed, are apparently present at the moment of neighbourhood  concentration. However it is stronger than usual consciousness of sensuous sphere, at the moment of neighbourhood  concentration. Especially, at the moment of full absorption, those five factors of absorption are stronger than those of absorption occurring at neighbourhood  absorption with the result that it is reaching to the nature of absorption of fine material sphere. It is right. \_\_\_\_ 

During  this  full  absorption  is  occurring,  the  initial  application  (*vitakka*)  arises obviously  and  apparently  by  means  of  applying  the  mind  on  the  object  of  sign  of  full concentration  of  mindfulness  of  breathing.  Sustained  application,  similar  to  knowledge, appears by reasoning on the sign of full concentration. Pleasurable interest and agreeable feeling occur by spreading throughout body. Therefore, the Buddha preached that — “*nāssa kiñci sabbāvato kāyassa vivekajena pītisukhena apphuṭam hoti*”. (*Dī*-1-70) 

- “There is no place without touching by pleasurable interest and agreeable feeling that is  

**PAGE 448** 

occurred by avoiding from hindrances of the whole body of the person who attained that absorption”. 

As the rim of lower part of casket fits and touches lid of upper part of casket, one- pointedness of mind (*cittekaggatā*) appears by touching thoroughly on the object of sign of full concentration. This is significant feature of factors of absorption occurring in the stage of fine material sphere rather than those occurring in the stage of neighbourhood  concentration. 

It is right the fact that among those factors of absorption, one-pointedness of mind (*cittekaggatā*) is not directly referred as factor of absorption like *savitakkam savicāram*, etc., found in PālNi Text mentioned above. But in  *Vibhańga* PālNi,  *Abhidhamma*, 2,267, it is preached that 

“*jhānanti vitakka vicāro pīti sukham citte*’*kaggatā*” 

- the absorption means a group of *vitakka*, *vicāra*, *pīti*, *sukha*, *ekaggatā*. Due to this reason, ***cittekaggatā*** is also designated as factor of absorption. It is right. — With the intention to show *jhāna* *dhamma* which is occurring associated with such *vitakka* etc., the Buddha had been  done  a  brief  account  of  it  by  showing  “*savitakkam*,  *savicāram*”   etc.  It  should  be recognized on the fact that with the intention to show *jhāna* *dhamma* which is occurring associated  with  that  *vitakka*  etc.,  the  Buddha  had  showed  clearly  in  the  PālNi  Text  of *Vibhańga*, indeed. (*Visuddhi*-1-142) 
20. **Threefold good qualities and 10-fold characteristics** 

There are threefold good qualities and 10-fold characteristics in the first absorption as follows. — 

1. ***paṭipadāvisuddhi*** = The purification of way of practice leading to the first absorption is designated as the “**beginning**” of the first absorption, in which three characteristics are present. 
1. ***upekkhābyūhanā***  =  The  development  of  equanimity  (*tatramajjhattupekkhā*)  is designated as the “**middle**” of the first absorption, in which three characteristics are present. 
1. ***sampahamsanā*** = The satisfaction is designated as the “**end**” of the first absorption in which four characteristics are present. 

***paṭipadāvisuddhi*** — During the concentration is developing by taking the object of brilliant  sign  of  full  concentration  of  mindfulness  of  breathing,  the  impulsion  of  full absorption  appears  in  such  impulsion  process  (*javana  vāra*).  By  the  time  that  impulsion process occurs those defilements called such hindrances are danger of that first absorption, indeed. The consciousness of the first absorption is purified from danger of absorption called those hindrances. — (1) 

Owing to purification of danger of absorption called hindrances, it is avoiding from hindrances which is capable of hindering not to attain absorption, with the result that the sign of practice (*samatha* *nimitta*) which is middle way, is fulfilled. 

**PAGE 449** 

***majjimam samathanimitta**m* *nāma samappavatto appanāsamādhiyeva*. (*Visuddhi*-1-

\144) 

The concentration of full absorption which is compatible to take the object of sign of full concentration without retardation or wandering of mind resulting in leading to the middle way which never falls into two extremities, is called the sign of practice (*samatha* *nimitta*). It is called the sign of practice due to occurrence of fundamental cause of the upper absorptions and noble supra-mundane *dhamma*. 

The  consciousness  of  *gottrabhu*  which  is  previously  occurred  and  capable  of benefiting  by  continuous  supporting  condition  (*anantara  paccaya  satti*),  becomes  well concentrated  situation  by  means  of  single  way  (*ekatta  naya*)  to  bend  the  continuum  of mentality toward that kind of situation, resulting in middle way of sign of practice is fulfilled. It is designated as the reaching to middle way of sign of practice (*majjhima samatha* *nimitta*). — (2) 

Due  to  reaching  to  middle  way  of  sign  of  practice  resulting  in  approaching  to occurrence of full absorption, it is designated as entering into that sign of practice. [By means of approaching to the concentration of full absorption as soon as the moment of reaching to middle way of sign of practice occurs, it is reached to the stability of mind with concentration of full absorption and then it is called entering into that middle way of sign of practice.] — (3) 

By  means  of  the  method  mentioned  previously,  it  should  be  recognized  on ***paṭipadāvisuddhi*** on the following situations which are present obviously in consciousness of *gottrabhu*, beforehand the full absorption, 

1. purification from dangers of hindrances, 
1. reaching to middle way of sign of practice, 
1. the way of practice leading to the arising of first absorption, which is capable of 

finishing to enter into that middle way of sign of practice. (*Visuddhi*-1-144; *Mahāṭīkā*-1-173) 

***upekkhābyūhanā*** — Owing to lack of preparing to purify that consciousness of first absorption which had been purified from hindrances again, with the result that the *meditator* does not perform to purify again and it can be said that he neutralizes the first absorption. — (1) 

It  can  be  said  that  the  *meditator*,  who  has  no  endeavouring   to  balance  the consciousness of first absorption which leads to proper way of practice due to reaching to full concentration (*appanā samādhi*), neutralizes that consciousness of first absorption. — (2) 

It can be said that the *meditator*, who has no endeavouring  to firm fix the sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing, which has only one nature, in other words, the *meditator* who has no  

**PAGE 450** 

endeavouring  to situate the consciousness of full concentration without associating of any defilement, neutralizes that consciousness of full absorption. 

Thus  it  should  be  recognized  on  development  of  *upekkhābyūhanā*  (= ***tatramajjhattupekkhā***)  by  means  of  function  of  mental  concomitant  called  equanimity (*tatramajjhattupekkhā*). — (3) 

***sampahamsanā*** — Such yoked *dhamma*, such as concentration and wisdom, which are occurring associated with consciousness of the first absorption which is developed by equanimity, occurs harmoniously without predominated to each others. — (1) 

Then owing to deliverance from defilements, five controlling faculties, faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom, occur in the presence of same functions, deliverance from defilements. — (2) 

Then  this  *meditator*  causes  to  occur  such  effort  which  is  compatible  to  those occurrences,  i.e.,  harmonious  function  of  concentration  and  wisdom,  presence  of  same function called deliverance from defilements. Such refuging (*āsevanā*)  which is occurred during perishing phase (*bhańga khaņa*) of that consciousness of first absorption is present. [After the arising phase (*uppāda*), the refuging (*āsevanā*) begins to occur at the static phase (*ṭhiti khaņa*). (*Mahāṭīkā*-1-174)] 

The  mode  of  occurrence  of  all  those  *dhamma*,  concentration,  wisdom,  which  are associated with the consciousness of absorption and are not predominant to each other, by means of knowing of all processes thoroughly (*pārihāriya ñāņa*) called impurity (*samkilesa*) and disadvantages of it, purification (*vodāna*) and advantages of it, concentration and wisdom can be occurred without predominating to each others by means of such such modes. Due to occurrence of satisfaction of the concentration of mindfulness of breathing; due to occurrence of finishing to perform by that *pārihāriya ñāņa*, due to occurrence of circumstantial purified, it is fulfilled by means of that that modes. Therefore, it is explained in *Visuddhi*-1-144,145 that 

*dhammānam  anativattanātdibhāvasādhanena  pariyodāpakassa  ñāņassa kiccanipphattivasena sampahamsanā veditabbā*. (*Visuddhi*-1-144,145) 

- It should be recognized on the **satisfaction** (***sampahamsanā***) by means of finishing to occur those *dhamma* called concentration and wisdom, without predominating to each others, and  finishing  to  occur  the  function  of  knowledge  which  is  capable  of  performing  and purifying it’s function. — (3) 

The  knowledge  is  obvious  in  the  mind  of  mindfulness  of  breathing  by  means  of equanimity  (*tatramajjhattupekkhā*).  It  is  preached  in  *Paṭisambhidā  Magga*,  page  221,  as follows. \_\_\_\_
