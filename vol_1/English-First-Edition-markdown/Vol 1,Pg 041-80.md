1. _Uggahapativedha_ = learning the text related to _Dukkhasaccā_ (the Noble Truth

of Suffering) and _Samudayasaccā_ (Noble Truth of Cause), and acquiring the knowledge penetratively.

2. _Paripucchāpativedha_ = knowing penetratively the meaning of _Dukkhasaccā_

and _Samudayasaccā_ by enquiring repeatedly.

3. _Savanapativedha_ = knowling penetratively the meaning of _Dukkhasaccā_ and

_Samudayasaccā_ by listening respectfully.

4. _Dhāranpativedha_ = knowing penetratively the meaning of _Dukkhasaccā_ and

_Samudayasaccā_ by learning by heart.

(These four are the knowledge acquired by being taught and by hearing).

5. _Samasanapativedha_ = knowing penetratively by contemplating on the Three

characters (_Anicca_, _Dukkha_ and _Anatta_) of the _Dukkhasaccā_ and _Samudayasaccā_ as the object. (It is all the Path Knowledge, the method of attaining insight).

These are the five kinds of _pativedha_ (penetrations). This _pativedha_ is the _dhamma_ of good _kamma_ of _loki_ (mundane) _mahākusala_ (great deed) by _Nirodhasaccā_ and _Maggasaccā_. . . . . .

_Nirodhasaccam_ ._i_ _ttham kan_. _tam m_. _anāpam, maggasaccam_

_Kantam manāpam_ (_Sam._-_Tha._-3: 160)

"_Nirodhasaccā_ is a necessary and adorable _dhamma_. so is the _Maggasaccā_."

By listening this way to the noble ones penetratively. knowledge is acquired = _Sava_- _pativedha_ = This only just what you. (Before arriving at _Ariyamagga_ = a section on _Pubbabhāpatipadha_).

After _Upacārakhana_ (preliminary moment) of _Ariyamagga_, there occurs the knowing of _Dukkhasaccā_ analytically (_pariññākicca_, the analytical function), elimination of _Samudayasaccā_ (the truth of arising), the function of elimination and meditation on the _Maggasaccā_, the function of meditation. Functionally they are _pariññāpativedha_ (pene- tration analytically), _pahānapativedha_ (analytical elimination) and _bhāvanāpativedha_ (analytical meditation). At the _Nirodha saccā_ called the non-dynamic element (_asankha- tadhātu_) _nibbāna_ _Armmanapativedha_ = objectively knowing penetratively = (_Sacchi- kiriyapativedha_ = knowing penetratively as the object). These _pativedhañāna_ (the analy- tical knowledge) belong to the _lokuttarā_ (supra-mundane).

When culturing _Ariyamagga_ (the Right Path) in accordance with **\*Pativedha- ññānam**,* all the five of the *Uggahapativedha, paripucchāpativedha, Savanapativedha, Dhāranapativedha* and *Sammasanapativedha* are not to be cultured. Only *Paññāpative- dha*, *Pahānapativedha, Bhāvanāpativedha, Arammanapativedha* of the supra-mu.n dane are to be cultured. Therefore it has been indicated as — *Sabbampi pativedhaññānam\*

_lokuttaram_. = all _pativedhañā_ belong to _lokuttarā_ (_Mūlatī_-2-72).

In other words the five kinds of analytical knowledge, such as _uggahapativedha_- _ñān_._a_ etc., are the basic cause of the supra-mundane analytical knowledge so that these

 five can alos be referred to literally (by way of _phupacara_) as _pativedhañān_. _a_. In this sense, with reference to _sabbanpi pativedhañān_. _a_, the knowledge such as _uggahapa- tivedhañān_. _a_ etc., can also be concentrated (_Mūlatī_-2: 72).

Only to those who know by _anubodhañā_._n_ _a_ and see by _pativedhañān_. _a_ the Four Noble Truth do the Buddha expatiates the attainment of the Noble Path (_Ariya Magga_) where all the cankers (_āsava dhamma_) have been eradiacted, but not to those who do not know or see in these ways. This is the essence of the meaning of the above documentary. Again the writer has explained in another way.

**The Third Opening of The Documentary**

_Patilomato vā dassanamaggena passato, bhāvanāmaggena jhānato_ (_Itivattaka_-_Tha_-310).

In one way, it means — I only preach the attainment of the Noble Path (_Ariya Magga_), where all the cankers (_āsava dhamma_) have been eradiacted, to those who see the _Ariyamagga_ by means of reverse _patiloma_ (contrast)and to those who know Four Noble Truth by means of the above three _Magga_. I do not preach to those who do not see and know in this way.

**The Fourth Opening of the Documentary**

_Keci pana "ññātatīranapahānapariñāhi jhānato, sikkhapattavipassanāya passato"tī vadanti_ (_Itivattaka_-_Tha_: 310).

I preach only to those who know, by three kinds of analytical knowledge such as knowledge by analysis (_ññātapariññā_), _tīranapariññā_ ( ) and _pahānapariññā_ (knowledge by analytical elimination), the Four Noble Truth of the mundane, and to those who, have attained peak of the insight knoweldge (_Sikkhāpatti vipassanā_) and know the Four Noble Truth of the mundane by this insight knowledge, the attainment of the Noble Path (_Ariya Magga_), where all the cankers (_āsava dhamma_) have been eradiacted (_Itivattaka_-_Tha_- 310). [Note. The three classes of *pariññā* will be treated later. The knowledge of the Four Noble Truth of the mundane via insight knowledge is treated in *Udayabbayañān*. *a* of the Section on *Vipassanā*].

**The Fifth Opening of the Documentary**

-   .

_Atha vā dukkham pariññābhisamayena jhānato, nirodham sacchikiriyābhisamayena passato. Tadubhaye ca sati pahānabhāvanābhisamayā siddhā eva huntīti catusaccābhi- samayo vatto hoti_ (_Itivattaka_-_Tha_: 310).

In still the other way it means, I preach only to those who know _dukkha saccā_ by means of _pariññābhisamaya_ (condition of congregated knowledge), _samudaya saccā_ by means of _pahānabhisamaya_ (condition of congregated analytical knowledge of elimination), _nirodha saccā_ by _sacchikiriyābhisamaya_ (condition of congretated knowledge of concen-tration), _magga saccā_ by means of means of _bhāvanābhisamaya_ (condition of congre-tated knowledge of meditation), the attainment of the Noble Path (_Ariya Magga_), where all the cankers (_āsava dhamma_) have been eliminated. I do not preach the attainment of the Noble Path (_Ariya Magga_), where all the cankers (_āsava dhamma_) have been eradiacted, to those who do not know by these means (_Itivattaka_- _Tha_-310).

_Bhikkhus_ .... If any one said " Without knowing penetratively, by my own, of the _dhamma_ of _dukkha ariya saccā_ (the Noble Truth of Suffering), of the _samudaya ariya saccā_ (the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering), of the _nirodha ariya saccā_ (the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering), and of the _magga ariya saccā_ (the Noble Truth of the Path), where all the sufferings have ceased, the _nibbāna_, truely by the right understanding (_sammā ditthi_), I would acquire free.d om from th.e suffering of the cycle of rebirth", then such a statement is preposterous (_Sam_.-3-394; _Sam_.-3.-383).

That this statement is absurd has been expatiated by the Buddha in relation to an example. What it means is as follows.

_Bhikkhus_ .... If any one said "I am going to build a house with its upper storey but without its lower (and foundation) parts." Then there is no way to happen what he has said. Similarly " Without knowing penetratively, by my own, of the Four Noble Truth truely by the right understanding (_sammā ditthi_), I would eradicate completel.y the suffering of the cycle of rebirth." Such a statement is a preposterous one (_Sam_.-3: 394).

.

Again in _Saccasamyutta khadirapatta suttan_ (_Sam_.-3: 383-384) too it has been preached as follows.

_Bhikkhus_ .... If any one said "I will make a cup using leaves of accasia, pine and goose berry to carry water, and I will use them as ear ornament", then what he said is absurd. In the same way" Without knowing penetratively, by my own, of the Four Noble Truth truely by the right understanding (_sammā ditthi_), I would eradicate completely the suf-

Such a statement is a preposterous one (_Sam_.-3: 383-384).

_dam ariyasa_._c_ _cam yathābh_._ū_ _tam abissamacceya_, _dukkha nirodha g_._ā_ _minam patipadan ariyasaccam yathābhūtam abis_._s_ _amacceya, s_._a_ _mmā dukkhassantam karissā"ti thāna- metam vijjhati_ (_Sam._-3:384, 394).

_Bhikkhus_ .... If any one said " With penetrative knowledge of my own of the _dhamma_ of _dukkha ariya saccā_ (the Noble Truth of Suffering), of the _samudaya ariya saccā_ (the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering), of the _nirodha ariya saccā_ (the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering), and of the _magga ariya saccā_ (the Noble Truth of the Path), where all the sufferings have ceased, the _nibbāna_, truely by the right understanding (_sammā ditthi_), I would acqui.r e freedom f.r om the suffering of the cycle of rebirth", then what he said is the reality (_Sam_.-3:384; _Sam_.-3: 394).

With an example it was again explained as

_Bhikkhus_ .... If any one said "I am going to build a house with lower (and

foundation) parts. first after which its upper storey will be made." Then what he has said will happen (_Sam_.-3-394).

_Bhikkhus_ .... If any said "I will make a cup using leaves of lotus, dipterocarpus tahnedm g awse e-taaru okr n(aam beitntet"r,- ttahsetnin wg hleata vhee suasiedd isin a mtraukthin (g*S* *a*s*m*o. u.-p3): t3o8 4ca).r r y water, and I will use

_Bhikkhus_ .... In the same way as these examples, if any one said " With penetrative knowledge of my own, of the Four Noble Truth truely by the right understanding (_sammā ditthi_), I would erad.i cate completely the suffering of the cycle of

 rebirth." Such a statement is a reality (_Sam_.-3: 383-384).

Again the Lord has expatiated as follows.

-   .

 _Tasmā hita bh_._i_ _kkhave_ "_idam dukkhan_"_ti yogo karaniyo_ ." _ayam dukkhasamudayo_"_ti yogo karaniyo,_ "_ayam dukkhan_._o_ _rodho_"_ti yog_._o_ _karaniyo,_ "_ayam dukkhanirodhagāminī patipadā_"_ti yogo karaniyo_ (_Sam_.-3: 384; _Sam_.-3: 394).

_Bhikkhave_ .... in this _desanā_, therefore, you should make effort to know that

1. "This the Noble Truth of Suffering."
1. "This is the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering."
1. "This is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering."
1. " This is the Noble T.r uth of the P.a th leading to the _nibbāna_, the Cessation of the Suffering." (_Sam_-3: 384; _Sam_.-3: 394).

In these suttan the Buddha has insisted the followers to make effort to understand the Four Noble Truth. Therefore, those who want to escape from the suffering of the cycle of rebirth must be determined to make effort to understand the Four Noble Truth to be able to escape from the recurrent of suffering of rebirth.

The following is the answer to as to how the penetrative knowledge can be acquired of the Four Noble Truth.

**_Vattasaccā_** — **_Vivattasaccā_**

-   .

_Tattha purimāni dve saccāni vattam, pacchimāni vattam. Tesu bhikkhuno vatte_ _kammathānābhivesohoti, vivatte natthi abhiniveso_ (_Abhi_.-_Tha_.-2: 109; _Dī_-_Tha_.-3: 160).

Of these Four Noble Truth the previous Noble Truth of Suffering and Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering are the _vattasaccā_ (the Truth of Suffering). The Noble Truth of Cessation of Suffering and Noble Truth of the Path, of the later occurrence, are the _vivattasaccā_ (the Truth of Eradication of Suffering, the _Nibbāna_). Of these two, the _vattasaccā_ and _vattasaccā_, _vivattasaccā_ is the object of meditation (_vipassana_ exercise) for the practicing monks = concentration. No meditation = concentration is made on the _vivattasaccā_ as the object of meditation (_Abhi_.-_Tha_.-2: 109; _Dī_-_Tha_.-3: 160).

In accordance with the instructions given by the above Commentaries, the practicing individuals should take the Noble Truth of Suffering and the Noble of Truth of the Cause of Suffering of the Four Noble Truth as the object of concentration. Effort must be made to concentrate on these by means of _uggahapativedha_, _savanapativedha_ and _dhāranapativedha_, called knowledge by learning, and _sammasanapativedha_ referred to as _vipassanā ñān_. _a_ (insight knowledge) to know penetratively = knowledge acquired via practice. Once successful by knowledge acquired from learning, the Noble Truth of Suffering and Noble Truth of Cause of Suffering are cultured and taken to heart by insight knowledge so that the knowledge through practice is attained. Now a further explanation will be made of the Noble ruth of Suffering and the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering.

**The Doctrine of the Noble Truth of Suffering**

**(The _Dhamma_ of _Dukkha Ariya Saccā_)**

_Katamañca bhikkhave dukkham_. _ariyasaccam_. _. "Pañcupādānakkhandhā"tissa vacanīyam_. _. Rūpupādānakkhandho vedanupādānakhhandho saññupāpānakkhandho sankhārūpādā-_

_nakkhandho viññānupādānakkhandho. Idam_. _vuccati bhikkhave dukkham_. _aruyasaccam_.\*

.

(_Sam_.-3: 373; _Khandhasuttan_)

_Bhikkhus_ .... What is the _Dhamma_ of the Noble Truth of Suffering? The answer should be _Upādānakkhandhā_ (the factor of -5-Fold Clinging to Existence). What then are _the upādānakhhandā_? They are _rūpupādānakkhandha_ (the Aggregate of the Matter), _vedanupādānakkhandhā_ (the Aggregate of the Sensation), _saññupādānakkhandhā_ ( the Aggregate of perception), _sankhārupādānakhandhā_ (the Aggregate of mental formation or reaction) and _viññānupādhānakkhandhā_ (the Aggregate of consciousness). _Bhikkhus_

These Five Aggregates are the _Dhamma_ of the Noble Truth of Suffering (_Sam_. .-3: 373; _Khandhasuttan_).

According to this _desanā_, note that _rūpupādānakkhandha, vedanupādānak- khandhā, saññupādānakkhandhā, sankhārupādānakhandhā,_ _viññānupādhānakkhandhā_, referred to as the Five-Fold _Upādānakkhandhā_ are the Noble Truth of Suffering.

_ayam viccati rūpupādānakkhandha_ (_Sam_.-3: 39; _Khandhāsuttan_).

_Bhikkhave_ .... The root of the object of cankers, _Ãsava_, (situated in the 31 Planes), the erroneous craving such as "I, mine, etc." are

1. All the past material factors,
1. All the future material factors,
1. All the present material factors,
1. All the internal material factors,
1. All the external material factors,
1. All the gross material factors,
1. All the delicate material factors,
1. All the ignoble (inferior) material factors,
1. All the Noble material factors,
1. All the distant material factors (far from the intelligence of the meditating individual),
1. All the nearby material factors (nearby the intelligence of the meditating individual).

-   All these 11 existing as material factors are to be called _rūpupādānakkhandha_ etc. (_Sam_.:-2: 39).

_Vedanupādānakkhandha_ etc. are also expatiated in a similar way. Therefore, the wrong understanding, which is the root of the object of canker, _Ãsava_, such as "I, mine", of the 11 classes of _upādānakkhandhā_ existing as material factors are the Dhamma of Noble Truth of Suffering. This must be respectfully accepted as is preached by the Buddha.

Included in this _upādādankkhandhā_ are the Five _Upādānakkhandha_ of Past and of Future. How are they contemplated? By _paccekkha ñā_._n_ _a_ (practical knowledge) or _anvaya ñāna_ (theoretical knowledge)? The answer is as given below.

_Dassanap_. _pabhāvum_. _hi upādāyā ñān_. _a samñgī puggalo cakkhunā rūpāni, ñān_. _ena vivatte dhamme passati_ (_Itivattaka_-_Tha_. 310).

**\*Jānato**tivā vatvā na jhānanam*. *anussavākāraparivitakkamattavasena idhādhippetam*. *, attha kho rūpāni viya cakkhuññānena rūpādīni, tesa*.*m* . *ca samudayādike*. *paccekhe katvā\*

 _dassananti vibhavetom "**passato**"ti vuttanti evum vā ettha atto (Sam._-*Tī.-*2: 63).

As a man sees the material bodies by physical eye, a meditator sees the _dhamma_ of the Noble Truth of Suffering and the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering by virtue of insight knowledge called the _paccekkha ñā_._n_ _a_, the ultimate truth of the nature of the object of concentration, which can be visioned in its true nature by the power of knowledge due to right understanding created by _vipassanā_ (meditation). To emphasize the essen. ce of the meaning **_passato_** is added after preaching as _jhānato_ (_Itivattaka_-_Tha_.: 310; _Sam_.-Tī-2: 63).

[Note. The Noble Truth of Cause of Suffering, which is the true Cause of the Five-Fold Material of Birth of the *dhamma* of the present Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering based on the Five-Fold Clinging to Existence. And they are part of the material body of the past. It will become clear in the Section on *Samudaya Saccā*].

If it is so then should the past and future factors be not meditated by means of _anvya ñā_._n_ _a_? The answer is as follows.

-   . .

_Nayadassanvasendai svvāā e avtuthma vauttattaāmn_._ā_ _gPaateth naavyaanmh_._ñ_ _ni eptai c_(*Mcuaphpāatnī.a-*2*d*:_h_ 4*a*2*m*3*m*)._ā_ _tam udayabbaya_

It can be put in another way by _Nayadassana_ (for the purpose of seeing). To begin with, _udayabbaya_ (the arising and perishing away) of present factors (_paccupan- nadhamma_) are by exercised by _paccakha_ (pactically). The past and future _dhammas_ are later practiced in this way (_Pyī. Visuddimagganissaya_ – 5: 265).

Care must be taken of the fact that in taking _udayabbaya_ of the present _dhammas_, the folowing are to be included.

1. _Paccayato udayabbaya_ (founded on arising and perishing away). Because of the distinct causes such as ignorance, craving, attachment, causative factors, action etc., the resultant five material factors etc. of the Five-Fold Material Factors are clearly formed. The arising and perishing away due to distinct causes such as ignorance, craving, _upādan_, _sankhāra_ and _kamma_ ceasing by nature of _anuppādanirodha_, the resultant five material factors come to cease by nature of _anuppādanirodha_.
1. _Khanato udayabbaya_ (momentary arising and perishing away) = momentary formation and dissolution of the five resultant five-fold material factors. In another way — [*Sappaccayanāmarūpapvasena tilakkhanam āropetvā* (*Ma*.-*Th*a.- 1: 281)]. Arising and perishing away of the cause and result referred to as

 _udayabbaya_.

Hence the resultant Five _upādānakkhandhā_ are the _dhamma_ of the Truth of Suffering.

The causes _avijjā, tahnā, upādan, sankhāra_ and _kamma_ are the _dhamma_ of the Truth of Cause of Suffering. The two kinds of _udayabbaya_: _paccayato udayabbaya_ and _khanatoudayabbaya_, of the Truth of Suffering and Truth of the Case of Suffering seen by means of _paccakkha_ called _vipassanā dhamma ditthi_ (right understanding of insight). When visioned in this way, the past and future are contemplated in a similar way by

 _anvaya_ _ñāna_. This is the answer to the above query.

**_Abiññan_ and _Vipassanā_ (Power and Meditation)**

1. A statement that past can be concentrated by _pubbenivāsānussati abhiññan_ (higher wisdom of rememberance of one’s former state of existence),
1. A statement that the future can be cincentrated by _anāgata ñā_._n_ _a_ (knowledge yet

 to come), which is a part of _dibbacakkhu abhiññana_ (the Heavenly eye).

These two statements are acceptable on the basis of factual substance. The fact

 that the past and future (the Five Aggregate) can be contemplated by _vipassanā ñāna_ (insight knowledge) is not satisfactorily acceptable. With regard to the latte. r, _Sammāsambuddha_ (the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha) himself has expounded in the opening of the doctrines as follows.

_Yehi ti keci bhikkhave samanā vā byamanā vā anekavihitam_. _pubbenuvāsam_. _anussaramānā anussarantia,ñ sñaabtbaertaem_ ._p_ _a_(_Knchuapjjpaāndiyhaā nsaukttkahma_. )_n_._d_ _he anussaranti etesam vā_

.

*Vedanādisupi eseva nayo (Sam.-Tha.-*2: 266).

_Bhikkhus_ .... If _samana_ and _byamana_ reminisce along aseries material body or bodies of the past, they can do so by virtue of their knowledge. Those _samana_ and _byamana_ who can reminisce, by virtue of. their knowledge, can dos so of all the Five-Fold Material Factor or each one of these (_Sam_.-2: 71; _Khajjaniya suttan)_.

In using the term _pubbenivāsa_ (reminsicent of the past) in this text, the Buddha does not mean the rememberance of of the previous life by power of _pubbenivāsānus- satiabhiññāna_ (reminiscent of the former birth). If the Buddha, however, does mean _pubbenivāsānussatiabhiññāna_, then _pubbenivāsa_ has been used referring to _samana_ (a monk or one who has eradicated defilements) and _byamana_ (a _brahmana_). It is because of this that the Buddha expounded as:

“_Sabbete pañpādānakkhandhe anussaranti etesam_. _vā añataram_. .”

"The _samana_ and _byamana_ who can reminisce by virtue of the order of the Five-Fold Material Factors and each of these individually, can do so by virtue of knowledge." The

 reason for this preaching is as given below:

To the _samana_ and byamana who can reminisce the material factors of previous birth by virtue of _pubbenivāsānupana abhiññāna_

1. The Five-Fold Material Bodies included in the supra-mindane _dhamma_.
1. The Five-Fold Clinging to Existence not included in the supra-mundane _dhamma_,
1. The body-related racial characters, physical features, nutrient, _sukha_ (mental ease), _dukkha_ (suffering) etc., and
1. The perception of various names

are the object of _pubbenivāsānussati abhiññañ_.

The Buddha, on the other hand, does not expatiate that these above four factors

can be reminisced orderly. The Lord only indicates that the Five-Fold Clinging to Existence or any one of these Five of the previous birth can be reminisced. Therefore, the Buddha does not mean can be made of the material factors of the former birth by means of _pubbenivāsānussati abhiññañ_. The Buddha only means that _Paramattha dhamma sabhāva_ (the nature of the ultimate _dhammas_) can be reminisced by _vipassanā_ _ñāna_ (insight knowledge). What it all means is that _rūpa_, _vedanā_, _saññā_, _sankhāra,_ _viñ_._ñ_ _añ_ etc., which have ceased in the past, can be recollected by the insight knowledge

 (_Sam_. .-2: 71; _Sam_. .-_Tha_.-2: 266).

**_Vipassanāvasena_ = Power of _Vipassanā_**

After _rūpa_, _vedanā_, _saññā_, _sankhāra_ and _viññañ_ of the present have been recol- lected = being analytically concentrated —"In the long past life also, I have had _rūpa_, _vedanā_, _saññā_, _sankhāra_ and _viññañ_" — these past factors were similar to those of the present. There is _vipassanā ñān_. _a_ which can vision the fact, such as "In the long past life also, I have had _rūpa_, _vedanā_, _saññā_, _sankhāra_ and _viññañ_", that there is no difference between the past and the present _rūpa_, _vedanā_, _viññañ_ and _sankhāra_. T. his means that the material factors that existed in the past can be recollected in order (_Sam_.-Tī.-2: 235).

These are the evidences from the doctrines indicating the differences between the powers of _pubbenivāsanussati abhiññā_ and _vipassanā ñā_._n_ _a_, are to be concentrated and can be concentrated by virtue of _vipassanā ñā_._n_ _a_. Now in continuation, rules and regulation followed by people of olden days by means of which past and future factors are meditated will be presented.

**Notes from _Anusaya Suttan_**

Then Rāhulā approached the Buddha, paid homage, get seated at an appropriate place, and put to the Lord the following question.

My Lord .... In what way should one know and and see so that the clinging "I" = wrong view, the attachment "mine" = _tahnā_ (craving), latent boastfullness = conceit, would not occur in the body living or non-living and arising signs together with _viññāna_?

1. Rāhulā .... That all material things of the past and future, which occur internally or externally, which ae coarse = _olarika_, which are subtle = _sukhuma_, which are inferior = _hīna_, superior = _panita_, which are far = _dure_, near = _santika_ are seen and known as = "_Netam mama_, _nesomahasmi_, _na meso attā_."

-   This material body is not I, this material body is not I. This material body is not

mine or not myself. By means of _vipassanā ñān_. _a_ (insight knowledge) and _Magga ñā_._n_ _a_ (Path knowledge) these are seen precisely as they truely are.

2. Feeling = That all Suffering .... R.
3. Perception = That all perceptions .... R.
4. Formation = That all the arising of mind and mental factors .... R.
5. Conscious Mind = That all the cognitions .... R.

Rāhulā .... Only in those who know and see in this way the internal, the external, living and non-living and arising signs of perception of I = the wrong view, clinging like

 mine = _tahnā_, latent boastfullness = conceit will not arise (_Sam_. .-1. : 444; _An_._u_ _saya sut_._t_ _an_)

**\*Netam mama nesoha masmi na meso attāti samanupassāmi**ti aniccam dukkham\*

_anattātisamanupassāmi_ (_Ma._-_Tha_.-4: 232; _Channovāda suttan atthakathā_).

In accordance with is opening of the Commentary, note that meditation on the five _upādānakkhandha_ (the Five-Fold clinging to the Existence) of the past and future as the object - _netam mama, nesohamasmi na meso attā_ - and meditation on the general

.

 characters such as _anicca_ (impermanence), _dukkha_ (suffering) and _anatta_ (non-self) as the object are the same. In so meditating, the five-fold clinging to existence of the present, past and future as object are all included in concentrating on these five. In meditating on the five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_, existing as 11 classes, the question arises as to which _ñāna_ (knowlege) is involved, _paccakkha ñāna_ or _anvaya ñāna_. See the following Atha. kathā (Commentary) Tīkā (Book of Mean. ing) opening fo.r the answer.

.

_Sammappaññāyapassati_ = vision by. the right knowledge means vision by insight knowledge and Noble Path knowledge (_Sam_.-_Tha_.-2: 197).

In _vipassanā_ prior to the Noble Path, the Five-Fold Clinging to Existence, existing as 11 classes, as the object are analytically concentrated. By virtue this concentration the impermanent, suffering and non-self characters of the five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_ are seen penetratively by one's own self through the right insight vision called _attapaccakkha ñān_. _a_. In the case of Noble Path moment (_ariyamaggakhana_), the five-fold _upādānakkhandhā_, existing as 11 classes, and which are the Truth of Suffering, contemplated via _kicca_ _ditthi_ (via penetrative understanding) penetrative knowledge of _priññābisamaya_ (analytical understanding) by virtue of which _ariya magga sammāditthi_ (right understanding of the Noble Path) called _attapaccakkha ñān_. _a_ (acquired practical knowledge) the _upādānakkhandhā_ are seen penetratively. (The penetrative knowledge without infatuation. By reje.c tion of _moha_ (dullness) which prevents the understanding

 the Truth of Suffering) (_Sam_._Tī_.-2: 181).

N.B. The insight knowledge, which has the ability to mentally culture the the factors of

 Five-Fold Clinging to Existence as the object, has been explained as **_attapaccakkha ñāna_**. When the factors of impermanence, of suffering and of non-self of the presently cul**.**t\** ured *dhammas* have been accomplished, the *dhammas* of the past and future, but are not presently cultured, can also be meditated in the same way by means of *anvaya ñāna\*.

**Notes from _Mahārāhulvāda Suttan_** .

Once Rāhulā,, following the Buddha, went into the town of Savatthi for alms reception. Rāhulā, who was interested in becoming the elder son of the King Cakkavatta, was admonished by the Buddha.

_sukhumam_. _vā hīnam vā panītam_. _vā yam_. _dure santike v_._ā_ _, sabb_. _am rūpam_ '_netam mama,_ "_Yam kinci Rāhula r_._u_ _pam atītānāgatapaccuppannam ajjattam vā_. _bahid_._d_ _hā vā_ ._o_ _lāka vā_

-   . .

_nesohamasmañ, na neso attā'ti evumetam_. _yatthābhutam sammappaññāya dathaabbam_"

(_Ma_.-2: 84).

Rāhulā .... That all material beings of the past and future, which occur internally or externally, which are coarse = _olarika_, which are subtle = _sukhuma_, which are inferior

-   _hīna_,. superior = _panita_, which are far = _dure_, near = _santika_ are seen and known as = "_Netam mama_, _nesomahasmi_, _na meso attā_." "This material body is not I, this material body is not I. This material body is not mine." (= concentrated as _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_). Meditate the truth in this way by right _vipassanā ñā_._n_ _a_ (_Magga paññā_ or the Path knowledge) (_Ma_.-2: 84).

It has been instructed to concentrate on the _vednā_, _saññā_, _sankhāra_ and _viñañ_ of the four material body in a similar way (_Ma_.-2: 84).

Here too all the _paccakkha ñāna_, called _vipassanā sammāditthi_ and _ariya magga sammāditthi_ are mentally cultured via _sammappaññāya_. At the time when the Buddha expounded _Mahārāhula suttan_, Rāhulā was a laity only 18 years of age. It must be noted that, because of this condition, it was instructed that in concentrating on the Five-Fold Clinging on the Existence (the five _upādānakkhandhā_) existing as the past, the future and the present etc. of 11 classes attempt must first be made to arrive at _attapaccakkha ñāna_ called _vipassanā sammā ditthi_.

**Notes on _Anattalakkhana Suttan_**

In scriptures in Pāli are many doctrines instructing to meditate on the past and future _upādānakkhandhā_. From among these doctrines, some will be extracted from the _Anattalakkhan Suttan_ which will be most relevent and familiar to you.

The Buddha explained to _sotapana_ (those who have entered the stream), and being mominated as _pañcavaggī_ (a company of five) about the impossibility of the five corporeality to follow one's own wish called _avasavattanattha_ (powerless to obligate one's whishes) = the nature of _anatta_ (non-self). After this explanation, question and answer on the five corporeality in the form of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ individually. When the Company of Five (_pañcavaggī_) have presented that the five corporeality are only the _dhammas_ of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _annata_, the Buddha instructed the object of mental culture as follow.

_bahiddhTāa svmā āo ltāīhriak abmh_._i_ _kvkāh sauvkeh_ ._u_.._m_. "_aYm_._a_ _mv_._ā_ _k hiñīncai mr_._ū_ _vpāa my_._a_ _amt_._ī_ _tdāunrāeg vaāta spaanctcikuep pvaān, asam_._b_ _baajjma_. _t traūmp_. _a vmā_. _mam_._a_ _, nesohasmi, na neso attā_"_ti evametam_. _yatthābhutam_. _sammappaññāya datthabham_.\*

(_Sam_.-2: 56).

_Bhikkhus_ .... the Five Aggregates are only the _dhammas_ of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ and, therefore, in this teaching (doctrine of the Buddha) my sons, meditate on the following in their true nature by _vipassanā paññā_ and _magga paññā_.

All the _dhammas_ of the material things of the past, future and present, all the internal factors occurring inside your life continuum, and those that occur external to you, coarse and subtle material factors, inferior and superior factors, all the far and nearby

 material factors, existing as 11 classes.

These are mentally cultured "_netam_. _mama, nesohamasmi_, _na meso atta_" as

1. This material body is not mine (= as suffering)
2. This material body is not I (= as impermanence)
3. This material body is not myself ( as non-self) (_Sam_. .-2: 56).

In the 4-Fold Mental Factors (the _Four Namakkhandhā_), such as _vedanakkhandhā_ (the Aggregate of Feeling) etc., are also instructed by Buddha to be meditated in a similar way.

In this way the Five Aggregate of the past and future are included in _vipassanā_ exercise as described in the _desanā_ of this _Anattlakkhana Suttan_. In accordance with these instructions, the members of _pañcavaggiya_ (refers to the her Three Path High Factors for members _pañcavaggiya_) arrived at _attapaccakkha ñāna_, referred to as _magga_

 _sammāditthi ñāna_ by meditating on the five _upādānakkhandhā_. (which always follows desanā knowled.g e) existing as 11 classes by virtue of exercise in _vipassanā_. Because of this exercise these members, who are named _pañcavaggiya_, in the wake of accomplish- ment of _Anattalakkhana Suttan_ attained the _Arahatta Phala_ (Fruit as the attainment of the last and highest stage of the Path).

.

_Imasmiñ ca pana vayākaranasmiñ bhaññāmāne_ ._b_ _hikkhunam anupādhāya āsavehi cittāni vimussinsu_ (_Sam._-2: 56).

Only the meaning of _Anattalakkhana Suttan_, but not the verse, was expatiated to the members of _pañcavaggiya_ and they were not attached to the five _upādānakkhandhā_ any more by the wrong understanding of I, mine, etc. but released from _āsava_ totally (_Sam._-2: 56).

Instruction of the meditation on _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ alternately in the form of question and answer is referred to as _Teparivattadhamma desanā_. Hundreds of similar _Teparivattadhamma desanā_ are present in the Buddha's doctrine. Most of these are found in _Khandhavaggasamyut_. The Buddha, the compassionate and the completely enlightened, has repeatedly instructed these, and those practicing individuals who are willing to acquire _nibbāna dhammas_ should obediently follow these instructions.

At this instant, of the Four Noble Truth described in _Ãsavakkhaya Suttan_, _Dukkha_

_Ariya Saccā_ (the Noble Truth of Suffering has been explicitly explained. Now again (_Samudaya Ariya Saccā_) the Noble Truth of Arising of Suffering will be dealt with.

**_Samudaya Ariya Saccā_**

(The _Dhamma_ of the Noble Truth of Arising of Suffering)

In the _Abhihammā_ (_Abhi_.-2: 211-215) _Saccavibañ_ of _Vibañ Pāli_, the Buddha has

expatiated

1. _Tahnā_ (craving) as the Truth of Arising,
1. _Tahnā_ together with all the _kilesa_ (defilements) as the Truth of Arising,
1. _Tahnā_, _kilesa_ together with all _akusala_ (ill deeds) as the Truth of Arising,
1. All the factors of _akusala_, and _alobha_ (disinterestedness), _adosa_ (amity) and _amoha_ (non-delusioned) = the three factors of primary _kusala_ (good deeds) which are the root of all _āsava_ factors and which make all beings go round and round in the cycle of rebirth as the Truth of Arising,
1. All that is _akusala_ and the _kusala_ which is the root of factors which make all beings go round and round in the cycle of rebirth as the Truth of Arising.

The Truth of Arising (_samudaya saccā)_ has been classified by five methods in this way. Referring to this _desanā_ _Sammohavinodanī Atthakathā_ and _Visuddhi Magga_ _Atthakathā_ have explained as follows.

-   .

_Tattha yasmā kusalākusalakammam avisesena samudayacassanti saccavibañge vattam_ (_Abhi.-Tha_.-2: 185; _Visuddhi_-2: 216).

-   All the _kuso_ (good deeds) and _akuso_ (bad deeds) are indicated as _cetanā_ (volition), _cetanāsampayuttadhamma_, especially in general as _samudaya saccā_ (Truth of Arising), by the Buddha in _Saccavibhañ Pali_ text (_Abhi.-Tha_.-2: 185; _Visuddhi_-2: 216).

In such doctrines as _Vibañ and Dhammacakka_ (Wheel of the Doctrine) the _tahnā_ (the craving) has been admonished as _samudaya saccā_. This was made so to give as an

example by extracting a fact in the direction of explanation being given. A mature seed, with its moisture and starch contents still intact, will grow into a plant of its own kind when planted in a soil with necessary factors like water, soil, favorable weather and light. So also with the support of _tahnā_ (craving) a life would result, the kind of life which corresponds to the action of _kuso_ (good deeds) or akuso (bad deeds). A burnt seed is depleted of its moisture and starchy contents, and the power to grow into a plant is lost. So too the life of noble individuals, in whose material and mental continuum the _kuso_ and _akuso_ accompanied by _tahnā_ called _kilesa_ (defilement) once resided, will no longer be able to come into being. Therefore, in the arising of a life, called the Truth of Suffering, the primary directing force for such a life and such and such object of attachment are the primary cause. That is the reason why the Buddha expatiated that primarily tahnā is the

 Truth of Suffering. The same applies to Nos. 2, 3, and 4 mentioned above.

The fifth method (of the above mentioned), in which all _kuso_ and _akuso_ (good and bad deeds) actions are indicated as the Truth of Suffering, is the method of _Nippadesa_ (separately) by the Truth of Suffering are completely treated without leaving a trace untouched. Again in _Añgutthora_ _Pali,_ _Tikanibatti_, _Titthāyatana Suttan_, the Lord has expounded as follows.

**Notes from _Titthāyatana Suttan_**

_sanKkahtāarmaapñaccac abyhāi kvkihñañvāen admu_. _k, kvhiñañsaāmnampuadcacayayām_.\* _naārmiyaarsūapcacma_._m_ _,_.\* _n, āavmijaj ārpūapcaapyaāc csaaynāk hsāarlāay, a-_ .

 Bhikkhus .... What is _Samudaya Ariya Saccā_ (the Noble Truth of Arising) that causes the _dukkha_ (suffering)? Because of _avijjā_ (ignorance) _sankhāra_ is formed. Because of _sankhāra_, _viññāña_ (concept) is formed. Because of the concept mind and material factors are formed. Because of the formation of the mind and material factors _sa_._l_ _āyatana_ (sense as the object) is formed. Because of _sa_._l_ _āyatana_ formation _phassa_ (touching or contact) is formed. Because of _phassa vedanā_ (feeling) is formed. Because of formation of _phassa_ _tahnā_ (craving) is formed. Because of _tahnā upādana_ (grasping)

.

is formed. Because of grasping a life is formed. Because of life formation birth results. Because of birth _jarā_ (ageing), _marana_ (death and decay), _soka_ (grief), _pariveda_ (crying), _dukkha_ (suffering), _domanassa_ (mental pain), and _upāyāsa_ (turbulent factors) come into existence. In this way the nature of the cause and of formation of a multitude of _dukkha_, which are non-_sukha_-inducing make their appearance. Bhikkhus .... The nature of this cause-result relationship = _Paticca samuppāda_ (the Causal relationship) should be called the Noble Truth of Causes of Arising which is the cause of suffering (_Am._-1: 178).

A meditator, who wish to be relieved of the cycle of rebirth, must try to vision penetratively the four _Ariya Saccā_ (the Four Noble Truth) by _sammā ditthi ñāna_ (the knowledge of right understanding). He should not forget that among these Four Truth are also included the cause-result relationship the _Paticca samuppāda_ which is the truth of *samuTdaat*H*tyha*o*a*.* w *s aa\* *yc*th*ac*e*sā* _m_ _S_(t*āa*h *ck*e*cu* _ā_ *s*T _a_(rT*l*u*ā*rt*k*uh*u*t oh*s*f*a*) *l*Ai*a*s *k*rCi*a*su*m*inl*m*tgu)*a*r.e _m_.d\* *a*in*v* *i*t*s*h*e*e*s* *e*C*n*h*a*a *s*r*a*ac*m*te*u*r*d* *a*o*y*f _aPsaatcicccaan tsi asmacmcuapvāibdaañ_ _ge_.\*

**\*saccappabhavato** viññātabbam yathāraham* (*Abhi.-*2: 185; *Visuddhi\*-2: 216-217).

In Saccavibañ Pāli all the _kuso_ and _akuso_ functions, which are created (_cetanā_, _cetanā_-related _sampayutta dhamma_ etc., are not particularly differentiated), are generally expounded by the Buddha to be _samudaya saccā_ too. Therefore, when the 12 classes of

 _paticca samuppāda_ (the causal relaionship), are categorized by way of _saccā_ (the Truth)

 _Avijjā_, _sankhāra,_ _tahnā_, _upādana_, _kammabhava_ are the groups of _samudaya saccā_. It is the _dutiya saccā_ (the second truth _dhamma_).

_Viññāna_, _nāmarūpa_, _sa_._l_ _ayatana_ (the sense as object), _phassa_ (contact), _vedanā_ (feeling), _upapattibhava_ (resultant way of next life) such as _jāti_ (birth), _jarā_ (ageing) and _marana_ (death and decay), which are the factors of _vipāka vatta_ (functions of the effects of one's action) are all grouped as _dukkha saccā_ (the truth of suffering). This is _pathama_ _saccā_ (the first truth). In short, note these in this way.

In the case of _avijjā paccayā sankhārā_ (ignorance based on mental formation), the _avijjā_ (ignorance) is the _samudaya saccā_, so also is the _sankhāra_. Therefore, all the factors of mental formation, formed due to _avijjā_, are the _avijjā_ called _samudaya saccā_, from which originated the _sankhāra_ referred to as _samudaya saccā_. This is said to be the _dutiya saccā_ of the _dutiya_ _saccā_ origin.

.

In the case of _sakhāra paccayā viññāna_._m_ (_sankhāra_ based on cognition), the _sankhāra_ is the _samudaya saccā_, and _viññānam_ is the _dukkha saccā_.

In the case of _vedanā paccayā tahnā_ (_vedanā_ based on craving), vedanā is the _dukkha saccā_. Craving is the _samudaya saccā_ (the truth of arising). _Tahnā_ derived from the _vedanā_ is the _dutiya saccā_ (second truth) originating from the _pathama saccā_ (the first truth) (= _dukkha saccā_).

In the case of _tahnā paccayā upādānam_ (craving based on _upādāna_) Tahnā as well as _upādāna_ are _samudaya saccā_. Therefore, _upādāna_ derived from craving is the _dutiya saccā_ (= _samudaya saccā_) from which originated the _dutiya saccā_ (_samudaya saccā_).\*\*

In _upādāna paccayā bhavo_ (life based on _upādāna_) _upādāna_ is _samudaya saccā_. The _kammabhava_ (sensual existence) is the _samudaya saccā_. The _upapattibhava_ (life due to rebirth) is _dukkha saccā_. Therefore, life derived from attachment is the _dutiya_ _saccā_ (= _samudaya saccā_) from which originated the _pathama cassā dutiya saccā_.

In _bhava paccayā jāti_ (the rebirth based on _bhava_) _bhava_ = _kamma bhava_ is the _samudaya_ _saccā_. _Jāti_ is the _dukkha saccā_. Therefore, rebirth derived from the sensual existence is _dukkha saccā_ (= _samudaya saccā_) on which _pathama saccā_ has it origin.

 originates _pathama saccā_ (= _dukkha saccā_) (_Abhi_._Tha_.-2: 185; _Visuddhi_-2: 216-217).

According to these expositions _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_ and _kamma_ are all _dhammas_ of _samudaya saccā_. _Viññañ_, _nāma_, _rūpa_, _salāyana_, _phassa_, and _devadanā_ are groups _dhammas_ of _dukkha saccā_. These are to be understood this way.

In accordance with the above opening of the doctrines which, with reference to _Patisambhidā Magga_, have described, and have to noted as

1. When sensual existence was created, the five causes cultured in the past, such as _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_ and _kamma_, which are the truth of arising

 due to which the five present results, which are the truth of suffering, such as

 _viññāna_, _nāma_, _rūpa_ _sal_._ā_ _yatana_, _phassa_, _vedanā_ etc, have appeared vividly.

2. The five present causes, such as _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_ and _kamma_,

cultured in the present existence, which are the truth of arising due to which

the five future results which are the truth of suffering, such as _viññā_._n_ _a_, _nāma_, _rūpa_ _sa_._l_ _āyatana_, _phassa_, _vedanā_ etc, will also appear vividly.

As a man would see the physical objects via consciousness by way of sight, so would a meditator endowed with _vipassanā sammāditthi ñān_. _a_ (the insight knowledge of right understanding) see the nature of the present results due to the past causes, and future

results because of the present causes. The above **Upanisa Suttan** _athakathā_ ._t_ _īkā_ and **Ãsavakkhaya Suttan** _athakathā_ have explained how a meditator can see the nature the

causal relationship of the past causes and present results, the present causes and the future results by **_paccekkha ñān_. _a_** (paractical knowledge) called the _vipassanā sammāditthi ñā_._n_ _a_.

The Buddha has also admonished in Ãsavakkhaya Suttan that if nature of forma- tion of _dukkha saccā_ due to _samudaya saccā_ as the cause cannot be aprreciated by _sammāditthi ñān_. _a_, the _Ariya Magga_ (the Right Path), where _dhammas_ of _āsava_ have been abolished, cannot be attained. Therefore those, who are willing to acquire _nibbāna_ appreciated via _Ariya Magga ñāna_ and _Phala ñā_._n_ _a_ (the Path and Fruit knowledge), must try to penetratively know the fact that _dukkha saccā_ is formed due to _samudaya saccā_. Put in another way, _samudaya ariya saccā_ (Noble Truth of Arising of Suffering) as the cause of _dukkha samudaya ariya saccā_ should by penetratively appreciated in its entity. Following the attainment in this way of penetrative appreciation by practical knowledge, meditate on the _dhammas_ of the past and future, which are _aditha_ (not of present), by _anvaya ñāna_ (theoretical knowledge).

**The Power of _Ñān_. _ā-kkhanikakamma_ (Various Unstable or Momentary Causes)**

Among the five-fold causes of the past, which are the basic causes of the present existence, five _paccuppanbhava pa_._t_ _isandhe khandhā_ (the five-fold materials of the present rebirth) etc., _kammabhava_ (active or sensual life) = _kamma_ also is one of the factors. This _kamma_, by virtue of _ñā_._n_ _ā-kkhandhā_, is the cause of _kamma dhammas_ which can be of help in formation of _vipāka khandhā_ (result of one's action). Since the causative factors and the resultant factors appear at different period of time, (different temporary factors formed on the basis of _kamma_) _ñān_. _ā_-_kkhanikapaccayakamma_ = from the moment of the present resultant factors different _kamma_ factor of the causes which have occurred at different moment. Then the question is "When did this _kamma_ factor of the cause make its appearance?. The answer is as given follows.

**\*Kammapaccayenā**ti anekānampi kappakotīnam matthake attano phalam uppādeton samatthena nānākkha*.*n\* _ikakammapaccayenāti at_._t_ _ho_. _Kusalākusalañhi kam_. _mam_. _attano_

_pava_. _ttikkhane phalam na deti. Yadiyadeya. Yam manusso devalokūpagam kusalakam- mam karoti, tassānubhā_._v_ _ena tasamañyeva khane devo bhaveya. Yasamañ pana khane avijjamānampi kevalam kata_. _ttāyeva dittheva dhamme upapajje vā pariyāye avasesa- paccayasamāyoge sati phalam uppādeti niruddhāpi purimasappādikiriyā viya kālantare_

_pacchimasippādikiriyāya. Tasmā nānākkhanikakammapaccayoti vuccati (Abhi-Tha._-3: 374; _Pathāna atthakathā)._

 What **_kammapaccaya_** (formed by _kamma_ as the cause) means is that, in not a single but even in tens of millions of worlds, actions that have been made in the previous life, and which could bring forth one's own results by virtue of _ñā_._n_ _ākkhanikakammapaccaya_ results of the different kinds momentary factors formed by _kamma_ as the cause) could be of supporting cause.

**Reason**. The _kusala and akusala kamma_ (the good and bad deeds) in the forming stages, as _upāda-thī-bhañga khana_ (arising-static-perishing away moments), are not powerful enough to give rise to resultant factors. If these two momentary deeds could give rise to the resultant factors, then a wordling would cultivate _kusala_ (good deed) which the cause for arriving at the heavenly abode. If so, by virtue of that good deed, the wordling would attain a heavenly being during that cultivating moment. But it was not to be so. The possibility is that the deed has been cultivated at that moment. During that cultivating moment, the good deed of the other moments do not as yet exist as _upāda-thī- bhañga_. But because the good deeds have been acquired as the sole action:

1. If that _kamma_ happens to be _ditthadhammavedanīya_ action (the result that is to be suffered during the present existence) — that has to be visualized during _paccuppan bhava_ (the present life)
1. If that _kamma_ happens to be _upapajjavedanīya_ action (the result that is to be suffered during the second life adjacent to the present one) — that occurs during the second life immeditately following the present life
1. If that kamma happens to be _aparāpariyavedanīya_ action (the result that has to be suffered during neither the present nor second but the consecutive lives starting from the third onwards, then —

If it happens to be _kusala_ (good deed) - or _gatisampatti, upadhisampatti, kāla- sampatti_, _akusala_ (bad deed), and if they conspicuously combined with the remaining causes such as _gatisampatti, upadhisampatti, kālasampatti_, then there can be a resultant factor (see _Abhi_.-_Tha_.-2: 421).

The way it happens is this. What has been learnt in early days would of assistance and helpful to the present learning, though the time period of the two are different. In the same way, culture of volition called _kamma_ may not give rise to result at that instant, but would of helpful to produce result only in the later moments. Therefore, _ñā_._n_ _ākhanika_ = the _cetanā_ (volition) from moment of appearance of result to respective moments (of different moments) resultant formations (_Abhi_.-_Tha_.-3: 374; _Pathāna Athakathā_).

**_DUKKHA SACCā_ AND _SAMUDAYA SACCā_** (The Truth of Suffering and of Arising of Suffering)

The five _upādānakkhandhā_ which existed as 11 classes of the past, future and present etc. are the _dukkha ariya saccā_ (Noble Truth of Suffering) and have clearly been explained above. Now once again _samudaya saccā_ will be explained.

On the basis of _samudaya saccā_ as the true cause of the five _upādānakkhandhā_ of present existence, if the _tahnā_ (attachment) is taken as _samudaya saccā_ by method of _paRdūhpāānraū_, *p*th*a*e*m*.n\* *p*th*a*a*ñ*t*c* _taakhknhāa_ *n*h*d*a*h*s *ā*to*,* *t*b*a*e*m*. a *sh*n*ao*a*mt*l*i*y*u* z*dd*e*ua*d*ky* *ka*a*h* s*sa* *a*t*s*o*ca* *c*w*cac*h*ma*.e *m.*n. , i*t*t*a* d*m*.i d _s_ h*a*a*m*p*u*p*d*e*h*n*ā* t*p*o*i* *k*o*ā*c* c*p*u*u*r*r*.*i\* _matahnā_

The _nāma rūpa_ are the five corporeality. Those five corporeality are the truth of suffering. The (_tahnā_) craving that has been cultured during previous existence, which can cause the truth of suffering, is the _samudaya saccā_ (_Abhi_._Tha_.-2: 68-69).

As explained above, if _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_ and _kamma_, or _sankhāra_ and _kamma_ cultured surrounded by _avijjā_, _tahnā_ and _upādāna_ are taken as being based on _samudaya saccā,_ as explained with reference to _patisambhidā magga pāli_ - _atīte hetavopañca_ etc.- and in accordance with these opening of the doctrines - this _samudaya_ _saccā_ is also a fact cultivated during the former life.

For the purpose of logical reasoning, a further explanation will be made. As it is clear that because of the _samudaya saccā_ as the cause, _dukkha saccā_ has resulted. In these cause and result phenomena, consideration should be made as to which comes first, the cause or the result. If a meditator accepts the fact that the _samudaya saccā_ as the cause occurs at a moment different from that of the* resultant *dukkha saccā*, i.e. each has its own moment of formation. The difference in their formative moments by virtue of *ñān*. *ākkhanikakamma*, the cause *samudaya saccā* which can give rise to *dukkha saccā* as the resultant are evident. If this assumption is accepted, i.e. because of the cause *samudaya saccā*, the resultant *dukkha saccā* has arisen for it is due to the cause that the result has occurred, then one of the doors on the path to *nibbāna\* would have opened for the meditator.

In considering the five past phenomena, keep _kamma_ as the prime factor which can be raised by virtue of _ñā_._n_ _ākkhanika kamma_. Because that _kamma_ is of _ñā_._n_ _ākkha- nika kamma_ kind, if the fact that _samudaya saccā_ is first formed in of wake which the _dukkha saccā_ appears as the resultant is accepted, then consider once again which is formed first, the _samudaya saccā_ or _dukkha saccā_.

Talking of a man on his present life, at the moment of commencement from a female gamete inside his mother, the three corporeality _kalāpas_, such as _kāyadassaka_ _kalāpa_, _bhāvadassaka kalāpa_, _hadyadassaka kalāpa_, and 30 classes of corporeality, and if being a _tihita_ individual, then there will be 34 species mind and mental properties.

 These 34 _nāma_ (mental) properties are as follows.

1. Conscious mind = _viññāña_ = 1 _somanssahagutta ñā_._n_ _asampayutta mahāvipāta citta_,
1. Thirteen of _cetasikka_ (Mind and metal properties) known as _aññasamāna_ (both bad

good ways),\*

3. Nineteen of _sobhanadhārana cetasikka_ connected with all the _sobhancitta_,
4. One _Paññañdare cetasikka_.

Making up 34 in all.

Included in this 34 are

1. _Vedanā_ (suffering) is the _vedanakkhandhā_ (aggregate of sensation/suffering)
1. _Saññā_ (perception) is the _saññākkhandhā_ (aggregate of perception)
1. The remaining 31 are the _sankhārakkhandha_ (aggregate of mental formation)
1. Consciousness = _viñāna_ is the _viñānakkhandhā_ (aggregate of consciousness).

The 30 kinds of _rūpa_ (corporeality) are the _rūpakkhandhā_ (aggregate of matter) and 34 kinds of _nāma_ are four kinds _nāmakhandhā_ (aggregate of mind), coming to a total of five _khandhā_ (five aggregate of matter). They are the _upādānakkhandhā_ (the five aggregate as .o bject of clinging). These five aggreates are _sankhittena pañcupādānak_- _khandhā_ (_Sam_.-3: 369). In accordance with the expression in Dhammacakkyā desanā they are the groups of _dukkha saccā dhammas_ (truth of suffering). For a human being (a worldling), therefore, it is the _dukkha saccā_ which has to come first in the present life.

If that _dukkha saccā_ is the result of _samudaya saccā_, as indicated in the _desanā_, the cause-resultant relationship pehnomenon, in which _samudaya saccā_ comes first and _dukkha saccā_ later if considered from point of view of _nā_._n_ _ākkhanika kamma_. If this can be accepted, then _samudaya saccā_, the cause of _dukkha saccā_, then that _samudaya saccā_ does not belong to the present existence but that which has been cultured in one of the previous life. And a meditator can easily accepted this explantion.

 If the _samudaya saccā_, surrounded by _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, were cultured during the past life, the question is which past life. The answer is that it might be one of the two:

1. _Upapajjavedanīya kamma,_
1. _Aparapariyavedanīya kamma_.

Suppose the _kamma_ is _upapajjavedanīya kamma_, then it was the _kamma_ which was cultivated during the first past life. If it is the _aparapariyavedanīya kamma_, then it was the _kamma_ cultivated during the second or third past or one earlier than these two. Be it the _upapajjavedanīya kamma_ or _aparapariyavedanīya kamma_, a meditator should concentrate, by _samāditthi ñān_. _a_ called _paccekkha ñā_._n_ _a_, on that _kamma_ named _samudaya saccā_, or due to that _kamma_ named _samudaya saccā_, there appear in this present existence the _pa_._t_ _issandhe_ (rebirth) and the five _upādānakkhandhā_ (the five aggregate of clinging to existence) etc. as the resultant _dukkha saccā_ (the truth of suffering). Only by knowing and seeing this way can _ariya magga_ (Noble Path), where all the factors of _āsava_ (fetters) have completely been abolished, be attained as the Buddha has expatiated in Upanissa Suttan.

If that _kamma_ named _samudaya saccā_ were _aparapariyavedanīya_ kind of _kamma_, then concentration by _paccekkha ñā_._n_ _a_ should be made in such a way as to penetratively know the fact that this _kamma_ was cultivated during the second past life etc. Cultivation of this past _kamma_ would have to made via _samāditthi ñāna_ r.e ferred to as _paccekkha_

_ñān_. _a_. Contemplation on this is explained in more details in section on Ahāra Suttan of Pat.i cca samuppāda in Nibbānagāminipatipadā Vol. 3).

If you cannot agree, because of your own belief called _ādānaggāhī_, with the fact that the _kamma_ which has been practised and cultured at a certain life in the past resulted in the five _patissandhe khandhā_ (five-fold aggregate of rebirth) of the present life. Then the followings will also have to considered again as to whether or not they are required.

1. For *Sammāsambodhi Bodhisatta*s four _asankkheyya_ and 100 thousands of worlds
1. For _Paccekabuddha_ *Bodhisatta*s* two *asankkheyya\* and 100 thousands of worlds
1. For *Aggasāvaka Bodhisatta*s, one _asankkeyya_ and 100 of thousands of worlds
1. For *Mahāsāvaka Bodhisatta*s, a hundred of thousands of worlds

For those respective period of time each has spent in practising and cultivating in _dhammas_ of perfection named _abhinihāra_ (resolve to become a buddha) by a way leading to _bodhi ñāna_ (knowledge of enlightenment) in the hope of acquiring it. The reason is the rejcetion of the fact that because of _kamma_, called _samudaya saccā_, of the previous existence the present _dukkha saccā_, called five _upādānākkhandhā_ (the five-fold aggregate of clinging for existence) have resulted. This rejection is as good as not accepting _kamma_ and its resultant formation. The failure of accepting this _kamma_-result correlation is doomed to have committed a dangerous great blunder of _ditthi_ (wrong view) called _ahetikaditthi_ (an opinion without a moral condition), _akiriyaditthi_( non- performing opinion) and _natthikaditthi_ (a sceptic opinion). It is similar to going down _niyataditthi_ (destiny of wrong view), the drain of great depth self-confidently.

It is true that _tahnā_ is the _samudaya saccā_. The present _tahnā_, the _samudaya saccā_, however, is not the cause of the present five _pa_._t_ _issandhekhandhā_ (the five aggre- gate of rebirth).

If the assertion that the present _dukkha saccā_ is the result of the cause _samudaya_ _saccā_ is accepted then, as indicated in the above doctrines, you can try to wish for a life in heavenly sovareignty by performing a good deed. If it is true that the cause of present _dukkha saccā_ is the present _samudaya saccā_, then your wish will be fulfilled instantly. But it was not so. In a similar way, you carry out a meritorious deed and wish for being free from becoming aged, from suffering, death and decay. If the appearance of _dukkha saccā_ as a result of the _samudaya saccā_, both of the present, were indeed the truth, your wish for not becoming aged, no suffering, no death and decay would be fulfilled in no time. But it has never happened. Similarly, a sixty-year old may wish for rejuvinating into a very good looking 16-year old by performing meritorious deeds. If the cause-result relation of the present _samudaya saccā_ and the present _dukkha saccā_ were, in fact, true then a very handsome 16-year old would have appeared immdeiately. But however much you made wishes by peforming good deeds, you never become a handsome 16-year old. You will still be aged, haggard, never going back to your youth and remain old. As a matter of fact, if the present _dukkha saccā_ were truely the result of the present _samudaya saccā_ by conducting meritorious works and the wishes fulfilled, then there will no more be the aged and ugly, those who are suffering, and those who are short-lived.

What the above descriptions, with examples, really mean is this. If a meditator is

aware of just the present _samudaya saccā_ and the present _dukkha saccā_, then he is not able to know the nature of formation of the _dukkha saccā_ as the resultant of the cause _samudaya saccā_. It is because clearly it is due to the _samudaya saccā_ cultivated during the past existence that the present _dukkha saccā_ has resulted, and that which is cultivated during this life cause the _dukkha saccā_, such as the five _patisandhekhandhā_ etc., of the coming existence will be formed as a result. It has been mentioned in Upanissa Suttan and Ãsavekkhaya Suttan, as expounded by the Buddha that without the penetrative knowledge, acquired via _paccekkha ñāna_, in oneself of the truth of _dukkha saccā_

 appearing as a result of _samudaya_ _saccā_, _ariya magga ñāna_ (knowledge of noble path) cannot be attained. . .

If a meditator does not meditate, by _paccekkha ñā_._n_ _a_, on the past then he can in no way know, by means of _paccekkha ñā_._n_ _a_, the _sankhāra kamma_ called _samudaya saccā_ surrounded by _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_ cultivated at a certain previous existence. Why? Because he did not. If the _samudaya saccā_ cultivated during certain previous life is not penetratively seen by means of _paccekkha ñān_. _a_, then the meditator cannot know, by _paccekkha ñān_. _a_, the appearance of the present _dukkha saccā_ as a result of the past _samudaya saccā_. The Buddha has expatiated that if the formation of the present _dukkha saccā_, such as the five-fold aggregate of rebirth etc., caused by the past _samudaya saccā_ cannot be penetratively seen by _paccekkha ñāna_, then _āsava_-free _ariya magga_ cannot be acquired. In the same way, if a meditator does not meditate, by _paccekkha ñā_._n_ _a_, on the future, then he can in no way know, by means of _paccekkha ñā_._n_ _a_, the _sankhāra kamma_ called _samudaya saccā_ surrounded by _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_ cultivated during the present existence. Why? Because he did not. The Buddha did not expatiate that if the formation of the future _dukkha saccā_, such as the five-fold aggregate of rebirth etc., caused by the present _samudaya saccā_ cannot be penetratively seen by _paccekkha ñā_._n_ _a_, then _āsava_-free _ariya magga_ can be acquired.

Similarly, if a meditator does not concentrate on the future, then he cannot see the future _dukkha saccā_ penetratively, via _paccekkha ñā_._n_ _a_ (pactical knowledge) called the _sammāditthi ñāna_ (the right understanding), as the result of the present _samudaya saccā_. Why? Because he did not concentrate on the future. The Buddha did not teach that without knowing penetratively by _paccekkha ñā_._n_ _a_ called _sammāditthi ñāna_ the formation of future _dukkha saccā_ because of the present _samudaya saccā_, one can attain the _ariya magga_ where *āsava*s have been abolished.

Therefore, to know penetratively by _paccekkha ñā_._n_ _a_ the appearance of the future _dukkha saccā_ as a result of the present _samudaya saccā_, a meditator has to start by cultivating on the past and future corporeality by the _paccekkha ñā_._n_ _a_.

The _samudaya saccā_ cultivated during the past existence are just the parts of aggregate of the past. The present _dukkha saccā_ derived from the past _samudaya saccā_ are also just the part and parcel of the present aggregate. What has been cultivated as _samudaya saccā_ in the present existence and which would become the future _dukkha_ _saccā_ are the parts of future aggregate.

A further explanation will make these statements become clearer. Among the

past phenomena or of the _samudaya saccā_ cultured in the past _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_ etc. are _kilesa vatta_ (functions of lust), _sankhāra-kamma_ are the _kamma vatta_ (functions of one's action). The five _patisandhe_ etc. (the five aggregate of rebirth) of human being which is the _kusalavipāka v_._a_ _tta_ phenomenon (result of the function of good deed) and the _sankhāra kamma_ which can give rise to _kammaja rūpa_ (material quality born of _kamma_) are just the _kusala sankhāra kamma_.

Here _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_ etc. are not the factors which can give rise solely to the _avijjā_, to _tahnā_ and to _upādāna_. They are formed accompanied by the relative _cetasikka_ (mind and metal properties). For the _putthujana_ (worldling) generally they occur naturally as mind-derived greediness. If it is the _lobhamū_ (the root of greed), the _somanassasahagutta_ (formed with feeling of joy), _ditthikatasampayuta_ (associated with recently seen) _sankhārika citta_ (mind associated with _sankhāra_), then in each of these _akusala citta_ (mind associated with bad deed) there will be 20 mental factors of mind and mental properties. These are as follows.

_Somanassasahagutta dithigatasampayutta lobhamū asankhārika citta_ – 1

_Aññasamānacetacikka_ – 13

_Moha ahirika anuttappa uddhicca_ called _akusalasādhāranacetacika_ – 4

_Lobha + ditthi_ – 2 Total ![](Aspose.Words.91ef50e2-8a22-40ad-9554-63f4a76c4039.001.png) 20

In each of the respective _jocittakkhana_ will be 20 mind and mental factors. Because of the presence of factors which have the potential of giving rise to _patissandhe_ as a result (rebirth as a resultant), they are the _manodvārikahovīthi_ (mental phenomena of mind-door processes) mental phenomena. In this _citta_ (mind) + _cetacikka_ (mind and

 mental properties) = mental factors –

1. _Vedanā_ is the _vedanakkhandhā_,
1. _Saññā_ is the _saññakkhandhā_,
1. Remaining (17) _cetacikka_ are _samkhākkhandhā_,
1. (_Lobhamū_) _Viññāna_ _ñān_. _a_ is the consciousness of _viññānakkhandhā_,

summing up to a total of four _nāma khandhā_ (mental factors)

5. The 54 kinds of the material factors nominated as _sasambhārahadaya_ together with the _hadaya vatthu_, which form the base of these mental factors, are _rūpakkhandhā_ – totaling as the five _khandhā_ (the five aggregate). (see meditation

 _Rūpakammathāna_ for number these 54 kinds).

These past four mental aggregate which are called the _kilesavatta_ (functions of the _kilesā_) are parts of the past aggregate resulting from the five _upādānak-khandhā_ correspondingly, called the _vipākavatta_ (function of the effects of one’s action). These existed in the past as the five _bhavañkhandhā_ etc., called the _manodvāra_.

Again, the _sankhāra_-_kamma_, if confined to the worldling, the basic cause of the five aggregate which existed as _tihittasomanassa patisan_. _dhe_ of a good man, has existed as the _tihittasomanassa pa_._t_ _isandhe_ in the past. And his present _sankhā-kamma_

are the result of those cultivated in the past. These _kamma_ may either be _upapajjanīya_

_kamma_ or _aparāpariyavedanīya kamma_.

_Cetanāham_. _bhikkave kammam_. _vad_._ā_ _mi, cetayitvā kammam_. _karoti kāyena vācāya manassā_ (_Am_-2-363; _Abhi_.- 4: 290).

In such _desanā_ (doctrines), the Buddha has expounded _cetanā_ (volition) as the the prime factor for _kamma_. Therefore, in accordance with _sankhāra_-_kamma_, _cetanā_ should primarily be taken as the prime factor.

_Cetanāsampayuttadhammānam_. _pana kammabhāvo kammacatukkena dīpito_ (_Abhi.- Tha._- 1: 131).

In accordance with the opening of Athāsālinī athakathā, _cetanā_, which is the _cetanāsampayutta dhamma_, and the corresponding _citta cetasikka sam_. _payutta_ factors

 are also indicated in the Añguttora catukkanipāta Bujjañga Suttan (_Am_.-1:559) by the Buddha to be the _kamma_. (see that Suttan for detail).

For that reason, _cetanā_ and its corresponding _cetanāsampayutta dhamma_ are to be taken with reference to _sankhāra_-_kamma_. The _sankhāra_-_kamma_, which are the basic causes of the five aggregate of the _tihittasomanassa pat_._i_ _sandhe_ of a good man existing as _tihittasomanassa pa_._t_ _isandhe_, are also the _somanassasahagutta ñān_. _asampayutta mahākusala cetanā_ and the _cetanāsampayutta dhamma_. There are 34 categories of _kusala cetanā_ and _citta cetacikka_. They are as follows.

.

_Somanassasahagutta ñān_. _asampayutta kusala citta_ - 1

_Añasamāna cetacikka_ - 13 _Sobhanasādhārana cetacikka_ - 19

_Paññañdare cetacikka_ - 1

Total 34 In these 34 mental factors ![](Aspose.Words.91ef50e2-8a22-40ad-9554-63f4a76c4039.002.png)

1. _Vedanā_ is the _vadanakkhandhā_,
2. _Saññā_ is the _saññakkhandhā_,
3. The remaining 31 are the _sañkhārakkhandhā_,
4. _Somanassasahagutta ñānasampayutta mahākusala citta_ is _viññānakkhandhā_,
5. Material bases of these mental factors are _rūpakkhandhā_,

When added together they come to be the five _khandhā_ (the five aggregate).

These _sankhāra_-_kamma_ are the factors which have the force to produce the five _paccuppana patisandhe_ etc., which are _vipakavatta dhamma_, and for which they are just the _manodvārika jovīthi_ (mind-door based process of apperceiving) mental processes.

 Each _jocittakkhana_ has 34 mental factors.

_Kāmāvacara kusalassa kammassa katattā upacitattā_ (_Abhi_.-1: 104).

According to these _desanā_, the _manodvārika jovīthi_ too have occurred not only once but many times. They are the groups of _kammavatta dhamma_. These _kammavatta_ _dhammas_ also are parts of the past aggregate which had appeared based on the five _bhavañkhandhā_ etc. of _upādānakkhandhā_ called _vipākavatta_ during the past life.

The _kilesavatta_, _kammavatta_ and _vipākavatta_ mentioned above, which are the the past five aggregate, and a practicing meditator must already have cultured these in the first place. He must have analytically concentrated these via _paccakkha ñā_._n_ _a_. Further he must already have analytically cultured, by means of _paccakkha ñā_._n_ _a_, all these five _patisandhekahndhā_ etc. of the _vipākavatta dhammas_ which had appeared due to the _kilesa vatta_ and _kammavatta_ factors.

Only after having cultured these by this kind analytical knowledge can onebe able to analytically culture, as a step further, the fact that the past _kammavatta_ appeared due to the past _kilesavatta_, and because of these past _kammavatta_ that the present five _pa_._t_ _isan- dhe_ aggregate are formed.

If, however, the basic causes of the present _vipākavatta_ which are the past _kilesa_- _vattakhandhā_, the past _kammavatta khandhā_, and their bases the past _vipākavattakhandhā_ are not cultivated at all, not concentrated at all, and not seen penetratively by _paccakkha ñā_._n_ _a_ at all, the meditator would have accumulated a multitude of unknown factors. Then this meditator will not have acquired the penetrative knowledge of the fact that the past _kamma vatta_ was caused by the past _kilesavatta_ and the present _vipākavatta_ caused by the past _kamma_ _vatta_. Because of the _samudaya saccā_ cultivated in past the present five aggregate etc. of _patisandhe_, called _vipāka vatta dukkha saccā_, are distinctly formed, and if these are not k.n own penetratively by _paccakkha ñana_, then the _ariya magga_ where the all _āsava_ factors have been annihilated will not be atta.i ned, as expounded by the Buddha.

Again, there are _kilesa vatta_ and _kamma vatta_ called _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_ and _kamma_ being cultivate presently. These _kilesa vatta_ and _kamma vatta_ are the cause for the future _vipāka vatta_ factors. If you, as a meditator, cultivate the _kāmāvācara, mahā kusala_, _sankhāra_-_kamma_ in anticipation of becoming a monk in the future life, then you have commited the following errors.

1. The nature of wrong consciousness as a monk is an ignorance,
1. The clinging to a monk’s life is the _tahnā_,
1. Mentally attached to the monk’s life is an _upādāna_,

And these are the three _kilesa vatta_. Suppose you are still existing at the stage of _rihitputhujana_. Then these factors of _kilesa vatta_ are groups of _lobhadithi_ in general. If you have happily made a wish, then there will 20 species of mind and mental properties as the wish was conditioned by _somanassa vedanā_. They are the the four _nāma khandhā_ (mental aggregate). Their material bases are the _rūpakkhandhā_. When added together they come to be the five aggregate.

Again, the _sankhāra kamma_ called the _kamma vatta_, if they are of _somanassaha_ _gutta_, _nana sampayutta_, _tihitta kāmāvacara kusala_ kind, then there will be 34 species of mind and mental properties. They are the four _nāma khandhās_. Their material bases are the _rūpakkhandhā_. When added together they amount to be the five aggregate.

As mentioned in Patisambhidhā Pāli _Edha paripakkattā āyatanānam_ (._P_. _atisa_. _m_.: .5 0),

according to which these _kilesa vatta_ and _kamma vatta_ are the groups of _dhamma_ can arise when the _indriye_ (control principle) has matured. These _kilesa vatta_, _kamma_ _vatta_, and _jhocitta_ which have the potential to give rise to the (future birth), are the groups of _nāma dhamma_ which lie within the process of _manodvārika jovīthi_.

Let us say a noble meditator is a 60-year old. Suppose also that he had wished for the life of a monk by performing good deeds throughout his life time. If so, then the _kilesa vatta_ and _kamma vatta_ have taken place before attaining the age of 60, and if he continues such a wish even after arriving at 60 years of age, these _dhammas_ can still occur. These _dhammas_ can appear only if they are based on the _vipāka vatta_, which are the five _bhavañkhandhā_ etc., called _manodvāra_.

As these _kilesa vatta_ and _kamma vatta_ are the causes of future _vipāka vatta_, this _kamma_ can an _ācinna kamma_ (practiced _kamma_). It may also be _āsanna kamma_ (near cause). Suppose you are a _chānalābhī_ (intelligent) individual longing for the life of a bhyammā in stead of wishing for a monk’s life, and the jhāna you have attained still lingers on to the time of death, then the cause of future _bhyammā_’s life or _bhyammā_’s _khandhā_ may be _garuka kamma_ (bent on _kamma_).

If it is the _ācinna kamma_, then this _ācinna kamma_ might have been one that was practiced before attaining the age of 60. Or it may be the _ācinna kamma_ that is going to be cultured after 60 and prior to death. The knowledge which can analytically appreciate and culture _nāma_ (mind) and _rūpa_ (matter), called _nāmarūpa pariccheda_ (analytical knowledge of mind and matter), the nature of relationship of the present resultant and the past cause, and of the future result and the present cause etc. which can be cultured by virtue of _paccayapariggaha nān_._a_ , and the _vipassanā ñāna_. (insight knowledge) by means of which the five _upādānakkhandhā_ can be concentrated as the characteristic object, and the _cetanā_ (volition) conditioned by these knowledge are said to be the _vipassanā cetanā_. This _vipassanā cetanā_ called the _vipassanā kamma_ can also be _ācinna kamma_.

_Ettha_ "_no ce bhikkhave ceteti no ca pakappeti_, _atha kho anussetī"ti evum_. _bhagavatā dutiyanaye pubbabhāge bhavanibbattaka kusalākusalāyūhanam_. , _pakappanañca vināpi_

_hoti_ (_Sam_.-_Tī_.-2: 83).

In accordance with the Samyuttatīkā opening with reference to Cetanā Suttan, the _vipassanācetanā_ = the _vipassanā kamma_ also have the potential to form _pa_._t_ _isandhe_ (rebirth).

**\*Ãyatim patisamdhiyā paccayo hotī**ti sankhārūpakkhāsampayuttakammassa balvattā teneva sugatipatisadhiyā dīyamānāya abhinandanasañkhāto lobhakile*.*s\* _o anāga_._t_ _e kāmā_._v_ _acarasugatipatisandhiyā paccayo hoti_. _Yassamā kilesasahāyam kammam_

_rūpa ñān_. _a_ of the _puthujana_ (worldling) is indicated by Patisambhidhā Pāli (_Pati_._s_ _am_.- 60) to be cause of the future _pa_._t_ _isandhe_ (rebirth). What it means of is this. If the _vipassanā kamma_, conditioned by _sankhārupakkhā ñā_._n_ _a_, is powerful, and if this _vipassanā kamma_ itself causes the _sugatipatisandhe_ as a result, then _abhinandha dhamma_ called _lobha kilesā_, and which has the affinity for _sankārupakkhā ñā_._n_ _a_, will in future be the cause of the _kāmāvacara sugati pa_._t_ _isandhe_. The _vipassanā kamma_, in combination with _lobha kilesā_, will directly result in _vipāka_ resultant. Therefore, the _vipassanā kamma_ is the _janaka_ cause giving rise to direct a result. _U_._p_ _atthambhaka_ _dhamma_, supported by _kilesā kamma_, is the causative factor (_Pa_._t_ _isam_.-_Tha_.-2: 250).

Therefore the _ācinna kamma_, which is about to give a result, is the kind of _kamma_ that frequently occurs in a time span from maturation of *indare*s to the time prior to death. Since it is this kind of _kamma_, it is a _dhamma_ called _addhāpaccuppana_ among the three classes of present.

If this _ācinna kamma_ is indeed going to give a result in future, then the meditator must first concentrate on this _kamma_ by _samāditthi ñā_._n_ _a_ called _paccakkha ñā_._n_ _a_. It should be noted that this is the kind of _kamma_ that will go on appearing any time throughout the duration of life.

Again if the _āsanna kamma_, which is cultured just before death, has the chance to truely produce future _pa_._t_ _isandhe_ etc. which is the _vipāka vatta_ as a resultant, then endeavour is made to penetratively see this _kamma_ by means of _samāditthi ñā_._n_ _a_ called _paccakkha ñān_. _a_. It must, however, be noted that, since _āsanna kamma_ is cultured just prior to death, it unlike the _kamma_ presently cultivating on the cause and result pre- vailing at the present period.

Again if the meditator is _chānalābhī_ individual and if the _mahagutakusala_, called the _garuka kamma_, is definitely about to give a result, then this _kamma_ must be cultured

 and seen penetratively by _samāditthi ñān_. _a_ called _paccakkha ñā_._n_ _a_.

After this _kamma_ has been cultured, _vipāka vatta_, which are the the future five

_pa_._t_ _isandhekhandhā_ etc. are cultured and seen penetratively via _samāditthi ñān_. _a_ called the _paccakkha ñān_. _a_. Only after cultivating this way, the following has to be cultured.

Due to _sankhāra kamma_, surrounded by _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādana_, referred to as the _samudaya saccā_, acquired during the present, the nature of the appearance of groups of

.

-   .

_dukkha saccā_ which are the future five _patisandhekhandhā_ called _vipāka vatta dhammas_ are visualized penetratively and cultured by _samāditthi ñāna_ called the _paccakkha ñāna_. (For detail on the way of culturing see section on Paticcasamuppāda).

If the meditator is still not satisfied with the statement that the appearance of the future _dukkha saccā_ due to the cause of the present _samudaya saccā_ can be cultured by _paccakkha ñā_._n_ _a_, then go through the opening of the doctrines given below.

_Ñā_._n_ _asamañgī puggalo cakkhum_._ā_ _viya cakkhunā rūpāni, ñān_. _ena vivatte dhamme passati_ (_Sam_.-_Tha_.-2:49; _Upanisasuttan_).

_Dassanappabhāvum hi upādāya ñān_. _a samañgī puggalo cakkhumā viya puggalo cakkhunā rūpāni_, _ñān_. _ena vivatte dhamme passati_ (_Itivuttaka_.-_Tha_.: 310; _Ãsavekkhaya_

 _Suttan_).

**\*Janato**ti vā vatvā na jānanam*. *anussavākārapaviritakkamattavasena idhādhippetam*. , *atha kho rūpāni viya cakkhuññān*. *ena rūpādīni tesam*. *c*. *a samudayādike pa*.*c\* _cakhe katvā_

_dassananti vibhāvetun "**passato"**ti vuttanti evum vā ettha attho_ (_Sam_.-_Tī_.-2: 63).

As a man could see a variety of material bodies with his physical eyes, so would a meditator, endowed with _vipassanāñāna_, see the _paramatthasabhāva_ object in its very true nature by virtue of knowledge acquired through _vipassanā_ he is exercising. Through the light shone by the knowledge acquired while exercising on _vipassanā_, he would see the following.

1. The five _upādānakkhandhā_ such as _rūpa_-_vedanā_-_saññā_-_sankhāra_-_viññana_,
1. The distinctness of the causes such as _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_, _kamma_ etc.
    1. because of these distinct causes the nature of samudaya (arising) of distinct result such as the five _upādānakkhandhā_; the nature of the formation these _upādānak- khandhā_ distinctly as _upāda_ which is the _nibbatti_ character,
1. Cessation, at the time of _arahatta magga_, of the causes such as _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_, _kamma_ etc. by means of _anuppādanirodha_ (non-reappearable cessation) = because of cessaton via non-returnable means, the cessation of the resultant five _upādānakkhandhā_ by _parinibbānacuti_ (released from death and rebirth), and the nature of this release, perishing away of these five _upādānakkhan- dhā_ called _viparināmalakkhanā_ (character of _dhamma_ subject to change) which is of the nature of _nirodha_ (= said to be _uppānirodha_).

This means to say that the above can be seen by means of _vipassanā samāditthi_ (_vipassanā_ insight). This knowledge is not a speculation based on what has been told by predecessors, called _anussava_ knowledge = not the kind of knowledge handed down from the previous ones. It is not a knowledge acquired by speculation based on the appearance and speculation such as "this might be it" = not the kind of knowledge acquired by _ākāra_- _parivitakka_ (careful consideration) (= _uppādanirodha_, a sudden, unusal event of cessa- tion) (_Sam_.-_Tha_.-2: 49).

Again, within the three moments of the past, future and present lie the five _upādā_- _nakkhandhā_ designated as cause _khandhā_ and resultant _khandhā_ also are the objects on the characters of which the concentration has to be made by means of the _vipassanā_ _samāditthi ñāna_ called _paccakkha ñāna_. (This does not mean all the past factors all along the circle of past existance, nor all the future factors of the circle of future life).

In this contemplation will be included the following.

 The five _kilesa vatta khandhā_ and the five _kamma vatta khnadhā_ reckoned as the past fives causes, the five _bhavañ khandhā_ etc. of the past five _khandhā_, which are the base of the _kilesa vatta_ and _kamma vatta_.

Because of the past five causes the present five _patisandhe_ _khandhā_, the five _bhavañ khandhā_ etc., which are the present five _upādānakkhandhā_, have appeared clearly, and based on these have appeared the five _kilesa vatta khandhā_ and the five _kam- ma vatta khandhā_ have appeared.

Because of these present causes such as _kilesa vatta_ and _kamma vatta_ would in future appear the resultants like the future five _patisandhe khandhā_ etc. of the future five _upādānakkhandhā_.

If you are still not contented with the above statements, the peruse the following sermons given in the doctrines.

_Yam kañci Rāhula rūpam atītānāgata paccuppanam_. R. _Sabbam rūpam_ "_netam ma ma_, _nesohamassami, na meso attā_"_ti eva metam yathābhūtam sammappapaññāya passati_ (_Sam_.-1: 444).\*

_Yam kañci Rāhula rūpam atītānāgata paccuppanam_. R. _Sabbam rūpam_ "_netam ma ma_, _nesohamassami, na meso attā_"_ti eva metam yathābhūtam sammappapaññāya datthabbam_ (_Ma_.-2: 84).\*

_Tassamā hita bhikkhave_ ... _Yam kañci rūpam atītānāgata paccuppanam_. R. _Sabbam rūpam_ "_netam ma ma_, _nesohamassami, na meso attā_"_ti evametam yathābhūtam sammappapaññāya datthabbam_ (_Sam_.-2: 56).\*

**\*Sammappapaññāya passatī**ti saha vipassanāya sulu passati* (*Sam*.-*Tha.-\*2: 197).\*\*\*\*

**_Samma_**. **R**. **\*passatī**ti pubbabhāge vipassanānñānena sammasanavasena*, *maggakkhane abhisamayavasena sulu atta paccakkhena passati* (*Sam*.-*Tī.-_2: 181)._

The Buddha has instructed Rāhula and the five _vaggiya_ to concetrate on the five _upādānakkhandhā_, which existed as the past, future and present etc. of 11 kinds, as _anicca_ (impermanece), _dukkha_ (suffering) and _anatta_ (non-self), and to contemplate on their true nature by means of _vipassanā paññā_ and _magga_ _paññā_, called _sammappaññā_ (true wisdom). Here the indication is restricted to concentration by _vipassanā ñāna_. The essence of these book of doctrines are as given below.

**_Sammappaññāya passati_** In vipassanā, which is prior to ariya magga, the past, future and and present _upādānakkhandhā_ are taken as object of concentration, by virtue of which the impermanence, suffering and non-self of these upādānakkhandhā are truely acquired*\*\* by *vipassanā sammāditthi*, calle *attapaccakkha ñāna* (*Sam*.-*Tha*.2: 197; *Sam*.- *Tī\*.-2: 181).

This is the end of explanation on the _samudaya sacca_. If you are still unsatisfied, then go through the following passages extracted from _desanā_.

**Extracts from Mahānīdāna Suttan**

_Gambhīro cāyam ānanda paticcasamuppādo gambhīrāvabhāso ca_. _Etassa cānanda dhammassa ananubodhā appativedhā evamayam pajā tantākusalajātā kulagantthikajātā muñjapabbajabhūtā apāyam duggatim vinipātam sansāram nātivattati_ (*Dī.-*2: 47; _Sam_.- 1: 318).

**\*Ananubodhā**ti ñātapariññāvasena anubujjhanā\*. **\*Appativedhā**ti tīranappahānapariññāvasena appativijjhanā*. (*Dī.*-*Tha*.-* 2: 88).

_Ãnandhā_ .... The logic of this _paticcasamuppāda_ (causal relationship) deep. And because of its depth it appears apprently deep to one's mind. _Ãnandā_ .... this causal rela- tionship should be appreciated by _ñātapariññā_ (intelligently known) called _anubhoda_- _ñāna_ (perceptual knowledge). If not appreciated accordingly then no one will know the attainment of the _magga_ (Path) and _phala_ (Fruit) by way of _tīranapariññā_ and _pahāna_- _pariññā_, called the _pativedha ñāna_ (penetrative knowledge). Because of such an ignorance the living beings are entangled in worldly affairs not unlike _muja_ and _pabbaja_ grasses (these grass are used as feet wiper, which after being used for a long time, become torn and worn out so that neither beginning nor end would be made out). It is similar to a nest of female weaver bird. They will be struggling in a tangle of worldly affairs in the rounds of rebirth. They would not able to escape from the rounds of _apāyaduggati_ (an unhappy existence) to which they fallen in disarray and without any hope or expectation and the rounds of _sugati_ (a happy existence) besides _apāya_ (_Dī_.-2: 47; _Sam_.-1: 318).

With reference to the above Mahānidāna Suttan, the Commentaries have made the following recommendations.

_Iduñhi gambhīrato agādham, nānāyaggahanato dūrabiyānam, ñānāsinā samādhipavarasilāyam sunisitena_ —

_Bhavacakkhamapadāletvā, asanivicakkamiva aniccanimmathanam_. _Samsārabhayamatīto_, _nakoci supinantarepayatti_ (_Abhi_.-_Tha_.-2: 189; _Visuddhi_-2: 221).

This logic of _paticca samuppāda_ (causal relationship) is deep, and because being deep, there can be no support. Particular methods of this relationship are complex like an inaccessible thicket of bushes, and difficult to escape from it. Without breaking through these factors of causal relationship, which have the property of torturing the worldling, by virtue of _samāditthi_, no one has escaped even in the dream from these catastrophic phenomena (_Abhi_.-_Tha_.-2: 189; _Visuddhi_-2: 221).

A meditator who is truely longing for _nibbāna_ must make effort to analytically and penetratively undestands the nature of causal relationship by means of _ñātapariñña_ called _anubhodha ñāna_, _tīranapariññāna_ called _pativedha ñāna_ and _pahānapariññā_, all referred to as the three _pariññāna_.

_Anubhodhā appativedhā_ = failure again and again to know by _anubodha ñāna_, failure to know the attainment of fruit of the Path penetratively is doomed to encounter the state of being lost and the rounds of rebirth which one cannot overcome. The Buddha, being sympathetic and merciful towards the living beings, has himself

expatiated this by his knowledge of _desanā_. Therefore, those who wants to be free from rounds of existence must make effort to know this factor analytically and penetratively by the three _pariññā pañā_ called the _pativedha_ understanding. It is not be attempted to know by speculation called _anumāna_ (knowledge by inference) understanding, nor is it the knolwedge imparted by the teachers. This will have to be well understood.

Since the suffering from the rounds of rebirth can only be escaped if the logic of _paticca samuppāda_ is understood analytically by the three _pariññā_, these three _pariññā_ will be dealth with in continuation. The _pariññā_ associated with the _paticca samuppāda_ is of two kinds: _lokīpariññā_ (_pariññā_ of mundane) and _lokuttarāpariññā_ (_parññā_ of supra-mundane). The _lokīpariññā_ again is of three different kinds: _ñātapariññā_, _tīranapariññā_ and _pahānapariññā_. In the _lokuttarapariññā_ also are _ñātapariññā_, _tīranapariññā_ and _pahānapariññā_. Now these _pariññā_ will be described.

**The Three Kinds of _Lokīpariññā_**

**_Ñātapariññā_** — If _lakkhana_-_rasa_-_paccuppathāna_-_patathāna_ of the _paticca_ _samuppāda_ characters of _avijjā_, _sankhāra_, _viññāna_, _nāma_-_rūpa_, _salāyatana_, _phassa_, _vedanā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _bhava_, _jāti_, _jarāmarana_ etc. can be digested and concentrated, then that knowledge is _nāmarūpapaticcheda ñāna_. (for the way to cultivate see section on Lakkhanādicatukka).

Again if the formation of _sankhāra_ due to _avijjā_, of _viññāna_ due to _sankhāra_, of _nāma_-_rūpa_ due to _viññāna_ etc. of the nature of causal relationship can be seen penetratively via knowledge by one's self, then that knowledge is the _paccayapariggaha ñāna_ (knowledge of discerning cause and effect).

These two _nāma-rūpapariccheda ñāna_ (knowledge that discerns mentality and corporeality as two separate groups) and _paccayapariggaha ñāna_, the knowledge which can understand analytically the _sankhāra_ states, and which should be understood, as the object of _vipassanā ñāna_ are **_ñātapariññā_**.

_Tīranapariññā_ — The features of _paticca samupāda_ such as _avijjā_, _sankhāra_, _viññāna_, _nāma-rūpa_ etc. are

1. to understand by knowledge the fact that formation is followed by destruction and it is inicca (the impermanence)
1. to understand by knowledge the fact that the effects of formation and destruction are always torturing, a feature of _dukkha_ (suffering) and it is the _dukkha_,
1. to understand by knowledge the fact that in essence what has been formed is not an indestrictible material _atta_ (self), but a feature of _anatta_ (non-self), the sammasana ñāna and _udayabbaya ñāna_ which can investigate and determine _anicca_ as, _dukkha_ as _dukkha_, and _anatta_ as _anatta_,
1. **_paccayato udayabbaya ñāna_** which can see the distict results, such as of the _viññāna_, _nāma-rūpa_, _salāyatana_, _phassa_, _vedanā_, etc. which form the aggregate of the _vipāka_ _vatta_, due to distinct causes such as _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_, _kamma_ etc.; **_paccayato udayabbaya ñāna_** which visualize that fact that because of the causes such as _avijjā_, _tahnā_, _upādāna_, _sankhāra_, _kamma_ of the _arahatta magga_ which have ceased by nature of _anuppāda nirodha_; **_paccayato vayadassana ñāna_** which is able to visualize the fact that because of such a kind of cessation, the _viññāna_, _nāma-rūpa_, _salāyatana_, _phassa_, _vedanā_, etc. which form the aggregate of the _vipāka vatta_ have come to cease completely by nature of _anuppāda nirodha_; **_khanato udayadassana ñāna_** which can recognize the _nibbattilakkhanā_ which is the formation of salient features _paticca_ _samupāda_; **_khanato vayadassana ñāna_** which can appreciate perishing of these features of _paticca samupāda_ by nature of _vaya_ called _viparināmalakkhanā_

[Note. These *paccayato udayadassana ñāna*, *paccayto vayadassana ñāna* are the *paccayto udayabbayadassana ñāna*. The *khanato udayadassana ñāna*, *khanato vayadassana ñāna* are the *khanato udayabbayadassana ñāna*].

These two _sammasana ñāna_ and _udayabbaya ñāna_ are termed **_tīranapariññā_**. This is wisdom by virtue of which _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_, the phenomena of _paticca samuppāda_ are known by investigation, determination and analysis.

**Instructions of the _Patisambhidā Magga Pāli_**

To meditate on the features of _paticca samupāda_ by _udayabbayanupassanā ñā_._n_ _a_ the Patisambhidā Magga Pāli has instructed as given below.

-   .

_Jātā avijjā paccupp_._a_ _nā_, _tassā nibbattilakkhanam udayo_, _viparimānalakkhan_. _am vayo_, _anupassanā ñā_._n_ _am_. R. _Jāto bh_. _avo paccuppanno_, _tassa_ ._n_ _ibbattilakkha_._n_ _am udayo_,

_viparimānalakkhanam vayo_, _anupassanā ñān_. _am_ (_Pa_._t_ _isam_. _._- 52).

1. The _paramattha dhamma sabhāvalakkhan_. _ā_ (_dhamma_ of the ultimate truth specific

character) in the making, called _paramattha_ _attabhāva_ (the ultimate truth of individuality) still acquiring, _avijjā_ within the three moments of _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañ_ is the _paccuppanna dhamma_ (the present state). The initial stage of the formation of _avijjā_ which is the present, the _nibbattilakkhan_. _ā_ is the formation = _udaya_. _Viparināma_ _lakkhanā_ (features subject to change) is destruction = _vaya_. The ability to repeatedly discern on the _udaya_ and _vaya_ is the _udayabbayanupassanā ñān_. _a_ (knowledge of meditating on the arising and dissolution of the object).

2. The _paramattha dhamma sabhāvalakkha_._n_ _ā_ (_dhamma_ of the ultimate truth specific

character) in the making, called _paramattha_ _attabhāva_ (the ultimate truth of individuality) still acquiring, _sankhāra_ within the three moments of _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañ_ is the _paccuppanna dhamma_ (the present state). The initial stage of the formation of _sankhāra_ which is the present, the _nibbattilakkhan_. _ā_ is the formation = _udaya_. _Viparināma_ _lakkhan_. _ā_ (features subject to change) is dissolution = _vaya_. The ability to repeatedly concentrate on the _udaya_ and _vaya_ is the _udayabbayanupassanā ñā_._n_ _a_.

[**Note**. If these _avijja_ and _sankhāra_ are the causes of _Paccuppanna pa_._t_ _isandhe_ and the five _khandhas_ etc. of the _vipākavatta_, then these two are the groups of the _dhammas_ of the past according to the statement _avjjā sankhārā atīto addhā_. The _vipassanā ñān_. _a_ which can discern them during their _upāda_ (arising stage) and during their _bhañga_ (disappearing stage) has been expounded by the Buddha to be the _udayabbayānupassanā_

_ñān_. _a_. These _dhammas_ have existed during the past period as _upāda-thī-bhin_. These _dhammas_, while existing within the three general characters, are also called the _paccup_- _panna dhammas_. Note also that the same applies to the _dhamma_ of _Paticca samuppāda_ given below].

\4. The _paramattha dhamma sabhāvalakkhanā_ (_dhamma_ of the ultimate truth specific character) in the making, called _paramattha_ _attabhāva_ (the ultimate truth of

individuality) still acquiring, _viññāna_ within the three moments of _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañ_ is the _paccuppanna dhamma_ (the present state). The initial stage of the formation of _viññāna_ which is the present, the _nibbattilakkhanā_ is the formation = _udaya_. _Viparināma_ _lakkhanā_ (features subject to change) is dissolution = _vaya_. The ability to repeatedly con-

template on the _udaya_ and _vaya_ is the _udayabbayanupassanā ñāna_.

 [Note. _Ye tāva ācariyā mahāvihāravāsinova yathā viññānam_, _evum ñāmarūpam_, _salāyatanam, phassam_, _vedanñca_, _paccayam_, _paccayuppannañca_ _sasantatipariyāpannam_ _dīpanto vipākameva icchanti_ (_Mahātī_.-2: 323).

From aspects of _suttana_, in culturing the _viññāna_, _nāma_-_rūpa_, _salāyatana_, _phassa_, and _vedanā_, the _mahāvihāravāsī_ would like to include the _vipāka vatta_ of the

 causes and results during formation only (_Mahātī_.-2: 323).

In accordance with this opening acquire the _vipāka vatta_ and _nāma_-_rūpa_ by _vipāka viññāna_ based on the _nāma_-_rūpa_ to come and on _viññā_. In this _viñña-nāmarūpa_ are included all the _vipāka_ _vatta_, _viññāna_ and _nāma_-_rūpa_ which can be formed at any stage from _patisandhe_ (birth) to _cuti_ (death). This is the _addhā paccuppanna_ (a present period from the birth consciousness to the death consciousness) _dhamma_ among the three kinds of _paccuppanna_. Here is an advice for you gentleman. Suppose you are going to live for a hundred years. Suppose again that you are at present 60 years old. Then your _patisandhe viññāna_ and _nāma-rūpa_ have appeared during the past 60 years and the _cuti viññā_ and _nāma-rūpa dhammas_ will only have a chance to appear in the remaining 40 years. And it has been expatiated that these _vipāka vatta dhammas_, which can make their appearance at any time from birth to death, are also _paccuppanna dhammas_. From point of view of _addhā_, these all _addhā paccuppanna dhammas_, but if viewed from _khana pac_- _cuppanna_ (momentary present) point these _dhammas_ have the chance to arise during the past, future or the present as the case may be. No matter when these _dhammas_ arise, be it during their formation or going to be formed, they are only of the _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañga_ (arising, static and dissolution) phenomena. If you are discerning on these _dhammas_ by means of _udayabbayā nupassanā ñāna_, concentrate on them during their arising _upāda_ and during their dissolution _bhañga_.]

4. The _paramattha dhamma sabhāvalakkhanā_ in the making, called _paramattha_

_attabhāva_ still acquiring, the _nāma_-_rūpa_ within the three moments of _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañ_ is the _paccuppanna dhamma_ (the present state). The initial stage of the formation of _nāma_- _rūpa_ which is the present, the _nibbattilakkhanā_ is the formation = _udaya_. _Viparināma_

_lakkhan_. _ā_ is dissolution = _vaya_. The ability to repeatedly contemplate on the _udaya_ and _vaya_ is the _udayabbayanupassanā ñān_. _a_.

5. The _paramattha dhamma sabhāvalakkhanā_ in the making, called _paramattha_

_attabhāva_ still acquiring, the _nāma_-_rūpa_ within the three moments of _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañ_ is

— _cakkhāyatana_ (eye-base sense), _sotāyatana_ (ear-base sense), _ghānāyatana_ (nose-base sense), _jhivāyatana_ (tongue-base sense), _kāyāyatana_ (body- or skin-base sense),

_manāyatana_ (mind-base sense) — the _sa_._l_ _āyatana_ which also is _paccuppanna dhamma_. The initial stage of the formation of _sa_._l_ _āyatana_ which is the present, the _nibbattilakkhan_. _ā_ is the formation = _udaya_. _Viparināma_ _lakkhanā_ is dissolution = _vaya_. The ability to repeatedly contemplate on the _udaya_ and _vaya_ is the _udayabbayanupassanā ñān_. _a_. (This _sa_._l_ _āyatana_ _dhamma_ also can arise at any time from conception to the whole life time of a worldling).

6. The _paramattha dhamma sabhāvalakkhan_. _ā_ in the making, called _paramattha_

_attabhāva_ still acquiring, the _phassa_ called _cakkhusamphassa_ (reaction of the eye), _sotasamphassa_ (reaction of the ear), _ghānasamphassa_ (reaction of the nose), _jhivāsam- phassa_ (reaction of the tongue), _kāyasamphassa_ (reaction of the skin/body) and _manosamphassa_ (reaction of mind) etc. , within the three moments of _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañ_ is also the _paccuppanna dhamma_ (the present state). The initial stage of the formation of _phassa_ which is the present, the _nibbattilakkhan_. _ā_ is the formation = _udaya_. _Viparināma_ _lakkhan_. _ā_ is dissolution = _vaya_. The ability to repeatedly contemplate on the _udaya_ and _vaya_ is the _udayabbayanupassanā ñān_. _a_.

[**Note**. This _phassa_ also is a _dhamma_ that can come into being throughout the life time whenever the door, the object and _viññā_._n_ _a_ become associated, giving respective results. Suppose a meditator has taken the _cakkhusamphassa_ as an object and discern on its arising and perishing away as the character by means of _udayabbayānupassa ñān_. _a_. Then this _cakkhusamphassa_ is just a kind of _dhamma_ associated with _cakkhu viññā_._n_ _a_. It is included in _cakkhu dvāra vīthi_ (eye door thought process consciousness). It is the _ahita vipāka nāma dhamma_ (a mental property of bad _kamma_-formation). The _udayabbayānu_- _passanā ñāna_ concentrating on this phassa is _mahākusala manodvārika jovīthi_ (the great moral mind-door thought process consciousness). (This statement refers only to a yogi, a blessed worldling, who is in the prime of his _udayabbaya ñān_. _a_ possession). The _cakkhu dvāra vīthi_ and the _manodvārika jovīthi_ are not simlutaneous processes. One occurs after another. In the same way, the _cakkhusamphassa_ and _udayabbayānupassanā ñā_._n_ _a_ are not the _dhammas_ that would occur in one _cittakkhana_ (thought moment) in association with one another. Let alone a _cittakkhana_, these two _dhammas_ would not arise in association even within one thought process.

_Dve pana phassā vā vedanā vā saññā vā cetana vā cittāni vā ekato uppajjanakāni nāma natthi_, _ekekameva uppajjati_ (_Ma.-Tha._-4: 60).

Within a thought moment no two _phassa_, nor _vedanā_, nor _saññā_, nor _cedanā_, nor _citta_ can arise simultaneously; it is natural that only one can occur at single a time (_Ma.- Tha._-4: 60).

Therefore when _cakkhusamphassa_ is arising by way of the _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañga_, the _udayabbaya_ _nupassanā ñā_._n_ _a_, included in _mahākusala manodvārika vipassanā jovīthi_, has not yet appeared via _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañga_. Again when this _udayabbaya_ _nupassanā ñā_._n_ _a_, which is concentrating on the _cakkhusamphassa_ as _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañga_ is arising, the _cakkhusamphassa_ is not the kind of _dhamma_ which still remains arising by _upāda_-_thī_- _bhañga_. It is so because no two different consciousnesses can appear within the duration of a _cittakhana_. This _udayabbayā nupassanā ñān_. _a_, however, can meditate on and see the _cakkhusamphassa_ during its _upāda_ (arising) and _bhañga_ (dissolution) stages. Hence the Patisambhidhā Magga Pāli has expounded as follow.

.

_Jāto phasso paccuppanno_, _tassa nibbattilakkhanam ud_. _ayo_, _vipariññāmalakkhanam vayo_,

.

_anupassanā ñāna_ (_Patisam_.: 52). (For its translation see No. 6 above).

Because _udayabbayā_ _nupassanā ñāna_ and the object _cakkhusamphassa_ cannot arise within a single _cittakkhana_, while _udayabbayā_ _nupassanā ñāna_ is in existence as _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañga_ the _cakkhusamphassa_ cannot be present as _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañga_. Care must be exercised in the fact that the _paccuppanna_ here does not necessarily means the popular _paccuppanna_ of daily use.]

7. The _paramattha dhamma sabhāvalakkhanā_ in the making, called _paramattha_

_attabhāva_ still acquiring, the _vedanā_ such as _cakkhusamphassajā vedanā_ (suffering), _sotasamphassajā vedanā_, _ghānasamphassajā vedanā_, _jhivāsamphassajā vedanā_ , _kāya- samphassajā vedanā_ and _manosamphassajā vedanā_ etc., within the three moments of _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañ_ is also the _paccuppanna dhamma_ . The initial stage of the formation of _phassa_ which is the present, the _nibbattilakkhanā_ is the formation = _udaya_. _Viparināma_ _lakkhanā_ is dissolution = _vaya_. The ability to repeatedly concentrate on the _udaya_ and _vaya_ is the _udayabbaya nupassanā ñāna_.

8. The _paramattha dhamma sabhāvalakkhanā_ in the making, called _paramattha_

_attabhāva_ still acquiring, the _tahnā_ such as _rūpatahnā_ (craving of form), _saddatahnā_ (craving of sound), _ghanda tahnā_ (craving of smell), _rasa tahnā_ (craving of taste), _pholabba tahnā_ (craving of touch) and _dhamma tahnā_ (craving of mental phenomena) etc., within the three moments of _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañ_ is also the _paccuppanna dhamma_ . The initial stage of the formation of _tahnā_ which is the present, the _nibbattilakkhanā_ is the formation = _udaya_. _Viparināma_ _lakkhanā_ is dissolution = _vaya_. The ability to repeatedly discern on the _udaya_ and _vaya_ is the _udayabbayanupassanā ñāna_.

[**Note**. The object of concentration by *udayabbaya nupassanā ñāna* is the *tahnā*. It is the *akusala dhamma*. The *udayabbayā nupassanā ñāna* that appears in the *santāna* (continuum) of yogis of a worldling status is the *kusala dhamma*. The *kusala* and *akusala* *dhammas* do not arise simultaneously within a period of *cittakhana*. It must be noted that these two are not the kind of *dhammas* that occur at the same time. However, this *tahnā* has the chance to appear at any time throughout *addhā paccuppanna* existence whenever the conditions prevail. The *udayabbatā nupassanā ñāna* possesse the ability to exercise *vipassanā* concentration on the *tahnā* during its *upāda* and *bhañga* phases.]

9. The _paramattha dhamma sabhāvalakkhanā_ in the making, called _paramattha_

_attabhāva_ still acquiring, the* corresponding *upādana* such as *kāmupādāna* (clinging to sensual form), *ditthupādana* (clinging to wrong view), *sīlabbatupādana* (clinging to ceremonial observences), *attavādupāda* (clinging to one's own personality) etc., within the three moments of *upāda*-*thī*-*bhañ* is also the *paccuppanna dhamma* . The initial stage of the formation of *upādāna* which is the present, the *nibbattilakkhanā* is the formation = *udaya*. *Viparināma\* _lakkhanā_ is dissolution = _vaya_. The ability to repeatedly discern on

 the _udaya_ and _vaya_ is the _udayabbayanupassanā ñāna_.

_Upapattihetubhūtam kammam kammabhavo_. _Kammābhinibbattā khandhā upapattibhavo_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 208; _Abhi_,-_Tha_.-2: 177).

_Upapattibhvuppattiyeva jāti_ (_Mahātī_.-2: 334)

With reference to the above stanza life is of _kammabhava_ (sensual existence) and _upapattibhava_ (process of becoming). The _kamma_, which is the cause of _upapattibhava_, is the _kammabhava_; the aggregates which arise as a result of this _kamma_ are the _upapatti- bhava_. The rising of this _upapattibhava_ is the _jāti_ (the future life). If the period of _pac_- _cuppanna_ is taken to present the midway, then the _kammabhava_ is _addhā paccuppanna_, the _upapattibhava_ called the _jāti_ represents the time to come. This _bhava_ will again be

 described as two separate kinds.

_Jāto bhavo paccuppanno_, _tassa nibbattilakkh_. _anam ud_._a_ _yo_, _viparināmalakkhanam vayo_, _anupassanāñānam_ (_Pa_._t_ _isam_.: 52).

10 (A) The _paramattha dhamma sabhāvalakkha_._n_ _ā_ in the making, called _paramattha_ _attabhāva_ still acquiring, the _kammabhava_ , within the three moments of _upāda_-_thī_-_bhañ_ is the _paccuppanna dhamma_. The initial stage of the formation of _kammabhava_ which is the present, the _nibbattilakkhanā_ is the formation = _udaya_. _Viparināma_ _lakkhan_. _ā_ is dissolution = _vaya_. The ability to repeatedly discern on the _udaya_ and _vaya_ is the _udayab- bayanupassanā ñā_._n_ _a_.

(B) The _paramattha dhamma sabhāvalakkhan_. _ā_ in the making, called _paramattha_

_attabhāva_ still acquiring, the _upapattibhava_ , within the three moments of _upāda_-_thī_- _bhañ_ is the _paccuppanna dhamma_. The initial stage of the formation of _upapattibhava_ which is the present, the _nibbattilakkhan_. _ā_ is the formation = _udaya_. _Viparināma_ _lakkhan_. _ā_ is dissolution = _vaya_. The abilit.y to repeatedly discern on the _udaya_ and _vaya_ is the _udayabbayanupassanā ñā_._n_ _a_ (_Pa_._t_ _isam_.: 52).

It must be noted that in the above Patisambhidā Magga Pāli all the _paticca_ _samuppāda_ factors from _avijjā_ to _upapattibhava_, called _jāti_, have been equally treated as the _paccuppana dhamma_. But if a breakdown is made on a temporal basis, if the present period is taken to represent the mid-period, then

1. _Avijjā_ and _sankhāra_ are the _dhamma_ groups of the first past period.
1. _Viññāna_, _nāma-rūpa_, _salāyatana, phassa, vedanā, tahnā, upādāna_, and _kamma-_
1. _bhava_. are the _dhamma_ gr.o ups of the present period.
1. The _upapattibhava_, named the _jāti_, is the _dhamma_ group of the future period.

All these _dhammas_ have been expatiated to be the _paccuppannadhamma_. It must be noted that this expation means the _paccuppannadhamma_ involved in _udayabbaya- ñā_._n_ _a_.

Now what it means is this. In discerning on these _pa_._t_ _icca samuppāda_ features via _udayabbayānupassanā ñān_. _a_, arising _upāda_ and dissolving _phases bhañga_ of these* features must be mentally captured by virtue of this *ñān*. *a.* These *dhammas*, during *upāda* and *bhañga* phases, are *paccuppanna dhammas\*. Now go on to the following opening of the book of doctrines.

. **\*Jātan**ti nibbattam patiladdhattabhāvum*. *Ayam hi jātasaddo khanattaya*. *samañgitam\*

_sandhā vutto_ — _"yedhammā jātā bhūtā_"_tiādīsu viya_, _na atītam —_

"_Ye te jātā_, _na te santi_, _ye na jātā_, _tattheva te_. _Laddhattabhāvā no bhaggā_, _teva santi sabhāvato_"_ti —_

-   . . .

_Ãdīsu viya_. _Nāpi jātatāmattam_, "_yam tam jātam bhūtam_. _sañkhat_"_an_. _tādīsu viya_. _Tenāha_ "**_jātam rūpam paccuppann_**"_anti_. _Paccuppannarūpam nāma jātam khanattayapariyā- pannati attho_ (_Mahā_._t_ _ī._-2: 419).

_Jāta_ is an _attabho_ (a form) that come into being and which can be acquired. (The _attabho_ is said to have attained when _paramattha dhātu,_ the ultimate element, that has materialized via _upāda-thī-bhañga_ into distinct form).

This _jāta_-_saddā_ has been expatiated as follows.

_Ye dhamma jātā bhūtā_ — (_Abhi_.-1: 213). These _dhammas_ are really formed and distinctly so. As explained in the texts, with reference to _upāda-thī-bhañga_ called _khanattayasamañgī_ = the state of being com.p lete with all the three _khanas_ (moments), it is expounded as _jātam_ _rūpam_ _paccuppannam_ (_jātā_, _avijjā_, _paccuppanna_) etc. in the Patisambhidhā Magga Pāli.

"_Ye te jātā na te santi_. R. _Teva santi sabhāvato_ = These _dhammas_ have already arisen, hence these past _dhammas_ are no longer present. Those which have not arisen yet are the future _dhammas_ and are not present yet. The _dhammas_ which have materialized via _upāda-thī-bhañga_ into distinct form is the _paramattha dhātu_, which have not dissolved yet, but still in existence. These are the only _dhammas_ which are still present as _sankhata paramattha sabhāva_ (ultimate reality produced by specific actions). In such cases _jāta saddā_ is expatiated as not referring to past _dhammas_.

"_Yam tam jātam bhūtam sankhatam_ (_Dī_.-2: 119; _Sam_.-3: 141). A a resultant _dhamma_ has appeared, and distinctly so. This is the result of combined actions of the

 causes. That _dhamma_ will disolve and cannot be wished not to do so."

In these doctrines, _jātasaddā_ is expounded to be just the formation = _jātamatta_. In this stanza _jātam rūpam paccuppannam_. R. _Jātā avijjā paccuppannā_ etc., the _jātasad_- _dā_ does not even instruct _jātamatta_ = the nature of just the formation. What is instructed is that it is complete with the three _khanas_ (moments) such as _upāda-thī-bhañga_ called _khanattayasamangī_. Therefore what it is means that — _jātam rūpam paccuppanam_ = the present corporeality, _jātā avijjā paccuppannā_ = the present _avijjā_ is the _dhamma_ icluded in the three moments as _upāda-thī-bhañga_ (_Mahātī_. 2: 419). This should suffice to apprehend _paccuppanna dhamma_ in section on _udayabbayā nupassanā ñāna_. But this not all there is to it. In Ãhāra Suttan desanā of Nidānavaggasamyutta Pāli instruction was oriented towards past factors. Therefore, meditation can be made on the causal relation- ship, _paticca samuppāda_ of the consecutive pasts. For instance see the following to note.

1. _Avijjā, sankhāra_ (_dhamma_ groups of second past period).
1. _Viññāna, nāma-rūpa, salāyatana, phassa, vedanā, upādāna, kammabhava_ (_dhamma_ groups of the first past).
1. _Jāti, jarāmarana_ (_dhamma_ groups of the _paccuppana_ period).

This has to be understood. (For concentration on a broader base see Sections on _Paticca samuppāda_ and _Udayabbayā nupassanā ñāna_).

This _Udayabbayā nupassanā ñāna_ also is the _Tīranapariññā_. The above descrip- tions made in association with the characters of _Paticca samuppāda_, which are \_

1. _Ñātapariññā_ called _Nāma-rūpa pariccheda ñāna_, _paccaya pariggaha ñāna_,
1. _Tīranapariññā_ called _Sammasana ñāna_, _Udayabbaya ñāna_.

Suppose you want to analyze as to whether these _pariññā ñāna_ are _paccakkha_ _ñāna_ or _anvaya ñāna_. Then examine the following extracts from Samyutta Pāli, Athakthā Tīkās.

_Virāgampāham bhikkave saupanisam vadāmi, no anupanisam. Kā ca bhikkave virāgassa upanisā. "Nibbidā"tissa vacanīyam. Nibbidampāham bhikkave upanisam vadāmi, no anupanisam. Kā ca bhikkhave nibbidāya upanisā, "yathābhūtañānadassan"anatissa_ _vacanīyam_ (_Sam_.-1: 268; _Upanisa Suttan_).

**\*Nibbidā**ti nibbdāñānam*. *Etena balavipassanam dassati\*. **\*Balavippassanā**ti bhayatūpathāne ñānam ādīnavānupassane ñānam moncitukamayatāñānam\*

_sankhārūpekkhāñānanti catonnam ñānam adhivacanam_. **\*Yathābhūtañādassan**anti Yathāsabhāvabhāvajānanasankhātam dassanam*. *Etena tarunavipassanam dassati\*.

_Tarunavipassanā hi balavipassanāya paccayo hoti_. **\*Tarunavipassanā**ti\* _sankhāra- pariccheda ñānam kankhāvitarane ñānam sammasane ñānam maggamagge ñānanti catonnam ñānam adhivacanam_ (*Sam.-Tha.-*2: 50).

_Paccakkhakaranattena ñātapariññā tīranapariññā ca gahitā hoti_ (_Sam_.-_Tī_.-2: 65).

Bhikkhus .... I preach to you that the Arahattamagga, where _rāga_ (lust) has been eradicated, arise because of the cause. I do not preach to you that it arises with cause. What is the cause of the Arahattamagga? It is the _nibbidā ñāna_ (knoweldge of aversion) which has become wearied of worldly life. Bhikkhus .... I preach to you that the _nibbidā ñāna_, which have had enough of this life, also arises due to the cause. I do not preach to you that it has arisen without a cause. Then what is the cause of knowledge of getting enough of the worldly life, the _nibbidā ñāna_? It is the _yathābhutañānadassana_, the knowledge of vision by power of which the nature of truth of *sankhāra*s are appreciated (_Sam_.-1: 268; _Upanisa Suttan_).

 **_Nibbidāñāna_** — _Bhayatūpathāna ñāna_ (the knowledge that concentrate on the fear), _ādīnavānupassanā ñāna_ (the knowledge that realizes evil consequence), _muncitukamayatā_ _ñāna_ (knowledge and _sankhārūpekkhā ñāna_ the four kinds of knowledge called powerful _bhalavavipassanā ñāna_. This _bhalavavipassanā ñāna_ is said to be the _nibbiddā ñāna_. This _nibbidda ñāna_ is the very cause of attaining the _arahatta_ _magga_.

 **_Yathābhūtañānadassana_** — This is the knowledge which has the ability to understand the true nature of the _Sankhāras_. _Tarunavipassanā_ is the _vupassanā ñāna_ in its early (or immature) stage. (1) _Sankhārapariccheda ñāna_ referred to as the _nāma-rūpapariccheda ñāna_, (2) _Kankhāvitarana ñāna_ referred to as the _paccayapariggaha ñāna_, (3) _Sammasa_- _na ñāna_, (4) _Maggāmagga ñāna_ referred to as _udayabbayā nupassanā ñāna_ — these four are the **_tarunavipassanā_** = _vipassanā ñāna_ in its early stage*.* Now this _tarunavipassanā_ is the very cause of _balavavipassanā_ (_Sam_. _Tha_.-2: 50).

In **_Yathābhūtañānadassana_** \*ñātapariññā**\* called** the\*\* _nāma_-_rūpapariccheda ñāna_ and _paccayapariggaha_ _ñāna_, _tīranapariññā_ called the _sammasana ñāna_ and the _udayabbayānupassanā ñāna_ with referecne to which the meaning of _yathābhūtañāna-_

_dassana_ has been given in the atthakathā. Because of the nature of the concept that they have the ability to have clear vision of the _sankhāra dhammas_ called _dukkha saccā_, _samudaya saccā_ etc. by means of _paccekkha_, the _ñātapariññā_ and _tīranapariññā_ are taken from aspect of _yatthā_-_bhūtadassana_ to give the meaning (_Sam_.-_Tī_.-2: 65).

In accordance with the above Pāli Atthakathā Tīka note as follows.

1. _Nāma_-_rūpapariccheda ñāna_ which is the knowledge that can discern the corporeality and mentality of _paticca samuppāda_ as two separate groups,
1. _Paccayapariggaha ñāna_ which is the knowledge that can discern on the nature of the cause and its consequences separately as paticca samuppāda factors which occurs again and again,
1. (i) _Paccayato udayavaya_, (ii) _Khanato udayavaya_ of these _paticca samuppāda_ characters — the two kinds of features called formation and dissolution, the _udayavaya_ and the true nature of their being _anicca_ (impermanence), _dukkha_ (suffering) and _anatta_ (non-self) which can be visualized mentally by _sammasana ñāna_ and _udayabbayā nupassanā ñāna_ — these are the _paccekkha ñāna_ (the practical knowledge).

If so, the question arises as to whether cannot these _paticca samuppāda_ characters be concentrated by means of **_anvaya ñāna_** (reviewing knowledge). This can be answered based on the following.

_Nayadassanavasena vā evum vuttam_. _Pathmañhi paccuppannadhammānam udayabbayam disvā atha atītānāgate nayam neti_ (_Mahātī_.-2: 423).

In other words — it is stated by _nayadassa_ in this way. In the first place discern on the _udayabbaya_ of the _paccuppana dhammas_ (the present _dhammas_), following which concentrate on those of the past and future in a similar way (_Pyī_.-_Visuddhimagga nissaya_ -5: 165).

**Note.** After culturing _paccuppanna dhamma_ indicated in this _udayabbaya ñāna_, and _udayabbaya_ of these _paccakkha dhamma_ by means of _paccakkha ñāna_, meditate on the _dhammas_ of the past and future following this way.

_Ñātapariññā_ and _tīranapariññā_ which are associated with the characters of the _paticca samuppāda_ have been treated, and now _pahānapariññā_ will be described in continuation.

**_Pahānapariññā_** — The meditation on the dissolution only of the three general characters, taken alternately as objects, of the _paticca samuppāda_ are the knowledges from _bhañga ñāna_ to higher order _vipassanā ñāna_. These are called **_Pahānapariññā_** because it enables one to analytically to know that has to known and relieving momentarily from factors of _kilesā_ that have to be eradicated, the states of _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_, which are the characters of _paticca samuppāda_. These are the three _lokipa_- _riññā_.

In Patisambhidāmagga Pāli (_Patisam_.- 55), the list of objects of concentration by knowledge of _bhañgā nupassanā ñāna_ have been counted from _avijjā_ (ignorance) to _jarāmarana_ (ageing, decay and death) of the characters of _paticca samuppāda_. So a meditator should concentrate on these characters of _paticca samuppāda_ by the knowledge

of _bhañgā nupassanā ñāna_. In the exercise of _viapssanā_ via _bhañgā nupassanā ñāna_, the objectsp on which the _vipassanā_ is made, the characters from _avijjā_ to _jarāmarana_ are the **_sampatidittha sankhāra dhammas_**. The _avijjā_ etc. which have escaped cocnentration by _bhanñgā nupassanā ñāna_ are the **_sampatiadittha sankhāra dhammas_**. These _sampa_- _tiadittha sankhāra dhammas_ are explained as — _aditthampi atītāgatam_ — etc. (Mahātī.- 2: 442). The following instruction is directed to exercise _vipassanā_ concentration on the past and future, which are _sampatiadittha sankhāra dhammas_, by means of _anvaya ñāna_.

_Atha vā so evum viriyatto yathādittham sankhāratam_, _tathā aditthampi anvayañāna- vasena nirodheti_, _no samudeti_. _Nirodhatova manasikaroti_. _nIrodhamevassa passati, no samudayanti attho_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 279).

**\*Evumviratto**ti evum bhañgānupassanāsārena viratto*. *Yathā dittham sampati sankhāra- gatam nirodheti norodham manasikaroti*, *aditthampi atītānāgatam anvayañānavasena\*

_yathā idam etarahi_, _evum itarepīti anuminanto nirodheti manasikatassāpi nirodham karoti_. **\*No samudetī**ti ettāpi eseva nayo*, *no samudayam manasikarotīti attho*  
\*
 (*Mahātī\*-2: 442)

_Ñātañca ñātañca ubhopi vipassati_ (_Visuddhi_-2: 278)

Because the _dhammas_ such as _avijā_ to _jarāmarana_ in _paticca samuppāda_ are the object to exercise _vipassā_ meditation on via _bhañā_ _nupassan ñāna_, they are the **_ñāta_**. The knowledge which is concentrating on these _ñāta dhammas_ is **_ñāna_**. In _bhañgā nupassanā ñāna_ a meditator has to meditate on the dissolution of the _ñāta_ taking it as the object. The dissolution of these _ñāta dhammas_ too are taken a object and meditate on it. And these are the _pativipassanā_ and is the kind of knowledge which takes both _ñāta_ and _ñāna_ as object in concentrating. These _ñāta_ and _ñāna dhammas_ are referred to as the

 _sankhāra dhamma_.

As the meditator always follows the _bhañgā nupassanā ñāna_ way, and who is free of attachment _rāga_ (by being able to be deflected for a considerable duration from), can take to heart the followings which appear at the comencement of practically visible knowledge--

1. The _ñāta dhammas_ from _avijjā_ to _jarāmarana_,
1. The _ñāna dhammas_ called _vipassanā ñāna_ which is discerning on the perishing

 away of these _ñāta dhammas_.

In the same way as taking these _dhammas_ to heart, the _sampati adittha_ which has

been meditated, not visualized and therefore has not appeared at the comencement of practically visible knowledge = the sampati anupatthita (those from _avijjā_ to _jarā maana_) so should the past and future _sankhāra dhammas_ be taken, by means of _anvaya ñāna_, as to be perishable. In such meditation, the present _sankhāra dhammas_ as well as the past and future _sankhāra dhammas_ are comparatively taken as objects and the nature of their cessation taken to heart, but not the _samudaya_ (arising) of their's. It means that these _dhammas_ are taken from view point of cessation = only cessation is taken to heart. The concentration is made on the nature of their cessation, but not their _samudaya_ (_Visuddhi_ - 2: 279; _Mahātī_.-2: 442).

**Them Three _Lokuttara Pariññā_**

At the end of _lokīpariññā pañā_ called _vipassanā_ knowledge the _ariyamagga_ _dhamma_ distinctly appears taking _asankhata dhātu_ (absolute element), element of freedom (from the worldly affiars) the _nibbāna dhamma_ as the object. This ariyamagga dhamma knows penetratively the respective defilements that have to be absolutely eradicated and _asankhata dhātu_, element of freedom, and _nibbāna dhamma_ by the _samuccheda_ (abandoned defilements permanently). Therefore, the _ariyamagga dhamma_ is definitely named **_pahāparññā_**.

_Ariyamagga dhamma_ is the vision of the object penetratively = to the _asankhata dhātu_, the element of freedom the _nibbāna dhamma_ objectively via _Ãramanapatideva_. In knowing so support is acquired by the force of _ārammanapativeda_ of the _asankhata dhātu_, the element of freedom the _nibbāna dhamma_. Because of such a support the _moha_ _dhamma_ (bewilderment factor), which is a hinderance to knowledge of the Four Noble Truths, is completely eradicated. By this eradication acquirement of the knowledge of the Four Noble Truths is simultaneously attained. The knowledge of the Four Noble Truths by way of _kiccasiddhi_ (acquired knowledge)* is called *asammohapativeda*. Then the *ariyamagga dhamma* knows the *Nirodha Saccā* (Truth of Cessation of Suffering) by virtue of *ārammanapativeda*. By virtue of *asammohapativeda* the *Dukkha Saccā* (the Truth of Suffering), the *Samudaya Saccā* (the Truth of Arising) and *Magga Saccā* (the Truth of the Path) are known. Because of knowing this way, the *ariyamagga dhamma* has completely acquired the knowledge of *dukkha saccā* and *samudaya saccā*, called *paticca samuppāda* features, and the nature of inter-relationship among these features. Viewed from these aspects the *ariyamagga dhamma* also is known as *ñātapariññā\*.

Again this aruyamagga dhamma also annihilates completely the _moha_ (delusion) which hinders the appreciation of the _anicca_, _dukkha_ and _anatta_ factors. By annihilating so, the characters of the _paticca samuppāda_ named _dukkha saccā_ and _samudaya saccā_, referred to as _rūpa_-_nāma_-cause-consequence = _sankhāra dhammas_, and the function of investigating and analysing these _dhammas_ by _kiccasiddhi_ are simultaneously accom- plished. Therefore, when viewed from this aspect _ariyamagga dhamma_ can also be nominated as **_tīranapariñña_**. These are the three _lokuttarapariññā_.

Only if the relationship of the cause and consequences, _paticca samuppāda_, are penetratively known by one's self via the _lokīpariññā_ and _lokuttarapariññā_, of three each, called the _attapaccekkha ñāna_, can this knowledge be called knowledge by _anubodha ñāna_ and _pativedha ñāna_. One can excape from _apāya_ (miserable existence), _samsāra_

 (rounds of rebirths), _dukkha_ (suffering) and _samsāra vatta dukkha_ (suffering due to one's action) besides _apāya,_ only if the _dhammas_ of the _paticca samuppāda_ are penetratively

 known by one's self via _attapaccekkha ñāna_. There never has been an instance, even in the dream, where any one escaped from the _samsāra vatta dukkha_ without knowledge of visualizing, by _anubodha ñāna_ and _pativedha ñāna_ called the _attapaccekkha ñāna_, the _dhammas_ of the _paticca samuppāda_. This is all there is to the extracts from the above

 Mahānidāna Suttan.

In discerning via _sammāditthi ñāna_, by a _yogāvacara_ individual (a meditator), on _paticca samuppāda dhammas_, formation of _sankhāra_ due to _avijjā_, formation of _viññāna_ due to _sankhāra_ etc. are not the only objects to concentrate on, but also on the process of

cessation of _sankhāraloka_, such as the cessation of _sankhāra_ due to cessation of _avijjā_, the cessation of _viññāna_ due to cessation of _sankhāra_. It was instructed to do so by the Buddha himself in Kiccāna Suttan and other Suttanas (see _Sam_.-1: 257 etc.).

The formation _udaya_ of the _sankhāra_ is said to be **_Lokasamudaya_**, and its dissolution _vaya_ the _lokanirodha_. In another way, the process of formation of _sankhāra_ due to _avijjā_, and the formation of _viññāna_ due to _sankhāra_ also is called **_Lkasamudaya_**, and also **_Anulomapaccayākāra_**. The complete cessation of _avijjā_ due to _arahattamagga_

-   **_asesaviraga_,** non-reappearable cessation = cessation by nature of **_Anuppādanirodha_** due which the resultants of _sankhāra_ etc. ceased completely = **_asesaviraga_ =** dissolution by means of non-reappearable cessation etc. of the process of cessation of _sankhāraloka_ is also the **_Lokanirodha_**, and also called the **_Patilomapaccākāra_**.

These _lokasamudaya_, _lokanirodha_ which are arising and perishing away of the _sankhāra_ and _anulomapaccākāra_ = _anulomapaticca samuppāda_, _patilomapaccayākāra_ = philosophy of _patilomapaticca samuppāda_, and when these are concentrated what would be the results? Should a meditator be contended with what has been handed down from the predecessors? Should one be meditating speculatively by means of _anvaya ñāna_ only? To these questions, the following is the answer extracted from Kiccānagotta Suttan.

**Extract from _Kiccānagotta Suttana_**

Once the Buddha was staying in the City of Sāvatthi. Then the Venerable Kiccā- nagotta approached the Buddha, took a seat at an appropriate place, and after paying homage, enquired of the Buddha a right answer to his query. My Lord it has said that the right view = _sammāditthi_, the right view = _sammāditthi_. Now what is the right view = _sammāditthi_? In answer to this query, the Buddha sermon _desanā_ nomonated as the Kiccānagotta Suttana. The following are some extracts from this _suttana_.

_Dvayanissito khāyam kiccāna loko yebuñyenaattitañceva natthitañca_. _Lokasamudayam kho kiccāna yathābhūtam sammappañāya passato yā loke natthitā_, _sā na hoti_. _Lokani- rodham kho kiccāna yathābhūtam sammappañāya passato yā loke atthitā_, _sā na hoti_. _Upayupādābhinivesavinibbandho khvāyam kiccāna loko yebuñyena_, _tañcāyam uyupādā- nam cetaso adhithānam abhinivesānusayam na upeti na upādiyati "attā me"ti_. "_Dukkhameva uppajjānam uppajjati_, _dukkham nirujjhatī_"_ti na kañkhati na vicikicchati_, _aprarpaccayā ñānamevassa ettha hoti_. _Ettāvatā kho kiccāna sammāditthi hotīti_ (_Sam_.-1:

257-258).\*
