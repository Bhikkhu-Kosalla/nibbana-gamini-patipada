1. *Uggahapativedha* = learning the text related to *Dukkhasaccâ* (the Noble Truth 

of Suffering) and  *Samudayasaccâ* (Noble Truth of Cause), and acquiring the knowledge penetratively. 

2. *Paripucchâpativedha* = knowing penetratively the meaning of *Dukkhasaccâ* 

and *Samudayasaccâ* by enquiring repeatedly. 

3. *Savanapativedha* = knowling penetratively the meaning of *Dukkhasaccâ* and 

*Samudayasaccâ* by listening respectfully. 

4. *Dhâranpativedha* = knowing penetratively the meaning of *Dukkhasaccâ* and 

*Samudayasaccâ* by learning by heart. 

(These four are the knowledge acquired by being taught and by hearing). 

5. *Samasanapativedha* = knowing penetratively by contemplating on the Three 

characters (*Anicca*, *Dukkha* and *Anatta*) of the *Dukkhasaccâ* and *Samudayasaccâ* as the  object.  (It is all the Path Knowledge, the method of attaining insight). 

These  are  the  five  kinds  of  *pativedha*  (penetrations).   This  *pativedha*  is  the *dhamma* of good *kamma* of *loki* (mundane) *mahâkusala* (great deed) by *Nirodhasaccâ* and *Maggasaccâ*.  .  .  .  .  . 

*Nirodhasaccam* .*i* *ttham kan*. *tam m*. *anâpam, maggasaccam* 

*Kantam manâpam* (*Sam.*-*Tha.*-3: 160) 

"*Nirodhasaccâ* is a necessary and adorable *dhamma*.  so is the *Maggasaccâ*." 

By listening this way to the noble ones penetratively.  knowledge is acquired = *Sava*- *pativedha* = This only just what you.  (Before arriving at *Ariyamagga* = a section on  *Pubbabhâpatipadha*). 

After  *Upacârakhana*  (preliminary  moment)  of  *Ariyamagga*,  there  occurs  the knowing of *Dukkhasaccâ* analytically (*pariññâkicca*, the analytical function), elimination of *Samudayasaccâ* (the truth of arising), the function of elimination and meditation on the *Maggasaccâ*, the function of meditation.  Functionally they are *pariññâpativedha* (pene- tration  analytically),  *pahânapativedha*  (analytical  elimination)  and  *bhâvanâpativedha* (analytical meditation).  At the *Nirodha saccâ* called the non-dynamic element (*asankha- tadhâtu*)  *nibbâna*  *Armmanapativedha*  =  objectively  knowing  penetratively  =  (*Sacchi- kiriyapativedha* = knowing penetratively as the object).  These *pativedhañâna* (the analy- tical knowledge)  belong to the *lokuttarâ* (supra-mundane). 

When  culturing  *Ariyamagga*  (the  Right  Path)  in  accordance  with  ***Pativedha- ññânam**,* all the five of the *Uggahapativedha, paripucchâpativedha, Savanapativedha, Dhâranapativedha* and *Sammasanapativedha* are not to be cultured.  Only *Paññâpative- dha*, *Pahânapativedha, Bhâvanâpativedha, Arammanapativedha* of the supra-mu.n dane are to be cultured.  Therefore it has been indicated as — *Sabbampi pativedhaññânam*  

*lokuttaram*.  = all *pativedhañâ* belong to *lokuttarâ* (*Mûlatî*-2-72). 

In other words the five kinds of analytical knowledge, such as *uggahapativedha*- *ñân*.*a*  etc., are the basic cause of the supra-mundane analytical knowledge so that these 

` `five can alos be referred to literally (by way of *phupacara*) as *pativedhañân*. *a*.  In this sense, with reference to *sabbanpi pativedhañân*. *a*, the knowledge such as *uggahapa- tivedhañân*. *a* etc., can also be concentrated (*Mûlatî*-2: 72). 

Only to those who know by *anubodhañâ*.*n* *a* and see by *pativedhañân*. *a* the Four Noble Truth do the Buddha expatiates the attainment of the Noble Path (*Ariya Magga*) where all the cankers (*âsava dhamma*) have been eradiacted, but not to those who do not know or see in these ways.  This is the essence of the meaning of the above documentary.  Again the writer has explained in another way. 

**The Third Opening of The Documentary** 

*Patilomato vâ dassanamaggena passato, bhâvanâmaggena jhânato* (*Itivattaka*-*Tha*-310). 

In one way, it means —  I only preach the attainment of the Noble Path (*Ariya Magga*), where all the cankers (*âsava dhamma*) have been eradiacted, to those who see the *Ariyamagga* by means of reverse *patiloma* (contrast)and to those who know Four Noble Truth by means of the above three *Magga*.  I do not preach to those who do not see and know in this way. 

**The Fourth Opening of the Documentary** 

*Keci pana "ññâtatîranapahânapariñâhi jhânato, sikkhapattavipassanâya passato"tî  vadanti* (*Itivattaka*-*Tha*: 310). 

I preach only to those who know, by three kinds of analytical knowledge such as knowledge by analysis (*ññâtapariññâ*), *tîranapariññâ* ( ) and *pahânapariññâ* (knowledge by analytical elimination), the Four Noble Truth of the mundane, and to those who, have attained peak of the insight knoweldge (*Sikkhâpatti vipassanâ*) and know the Four Noble Truth of the mundane by this insight knowledge, the attainment of the Noble Path (*Ariya Magga*), where all the cankers (*âsava dhamma*) have been eradiacted (*Itivattaka*-*Tha*- 310). [Note.  The three classes of *pariññâ* will be treated later.  The knowledge of the Four Noble Truth of the mundane via insight knowledge is treated in *Udayabbayañân*. *a* of the Section on *Vipassanâ*]. 

**The Fifth Opening of the Documentary**

*Atha vâ dukkham pariññâbhisamayena jhânato, nirodham sacchikiriyâbhisamayena passato. Tadubhaye ca sati pahânabhâvanâbhisamayâ siddhâ eva huntîti catusaccâbhi- samayo vatto hoti* (*Itivattaka*-*Tha*: 310). 

In still the other way it means, I preach only to those who know *dukkha saccâ* by means of *pariññâbhisamaya* (condition of congregated knowledge), *samudaya saccâ* by means  of  *pahânabhisamaya*  (condition  of  congregated  analytical  knowledge  of elimination),  *nirodha  saccâ*  by  *sacchikiriyâbhisamaya*  (condition  of  congretated knowledge of concen-tration), *magga saccâ* by means of means of *bhâvanâbhisamaya* (condition of congre-tated knowledge of meditation), the attainment of the Noble Path (*Ariya Magga*), where all the cankers (*âsava dhamma*) have been eliminated.  I do not preach the attainment of the Noble Path (*Ariya Magga*), where all the cankers (*âsava dhamma*) have been eradiacted, to those who do not know by these means (*Itivattaka*- *Tha*-310).

*Bhikkhus* .... If any one said " Without knowing penetratively, by my own, of the *dhamma* of  *dukkha ariya saccâ* (the Noble Truth of Suffering), of the *samudaya ariya saccâ* (the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering), of the *nirodha ariya saccâ* (the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering), and of the *magga ariya saccâ* (the Noble Truth of the  Path),  where  all  the  sufferings  have  ceased,  the  *nibbâna*,  truely  by  the  right understanding (*sammâ ditthi*), I would acquire free.d om from th.e  suffering of the cycle of  rebirth", then such a statement is preposterous (*Sam*.-3-394; *Sam*.-3.-383). 

That this statement is absurd has been expatiated by the Buddha in relation to an  example.  What it means is as follows. 

*Bhikkhus* .... If any one said "I am going to build a house with its upper storey but without its lower (and foundation) parts."  Then there is no way to happen what he has  said.  Similarly " Without knowing penetratively, by my own, of the Four Noble Truth truely by the right understanding (*sammâ ditthi*), I would eradicate completel.y  the  suffering of the cycle of rebirth."  Such a statement is a preposterous one (*Sam*.-3: 394). 

. 

Again in *Saccasamyutta khadirapatta suttan* (*Sam*.-3: 383-384) too it has been preached as follows. 

*Bhikkhus* .... If any one said "I will make a cup using leaves of accasia, pine and goose berry to carry water, and I will use them as ear ornament", then what he said is absurd.  In the same way" Without knowing penetratively, by my own, of the Four Noble Truth truely by the right understanding (*sammâ ditthi*), I would eradicate completely the suf-

Such a statement is a preposterous one (*Sam*.-3: 383-384). 

*dam ariyasa*.*c* *cam yathâbh*.*û* *tam abissamacceya*, *dukkha nirodha g*.*â* *minam patipadan ariyasaccam yathâbhûtam abis*.*s* *amacceya, s*.*a* *mmâ dukkhassantam karissâ"ti thâna- metam vijjhati* (*Sam.*-3:384, 394). 

*Bhikkhus* .... If any one said " With penetrative knowledge of my own of the *dhamma* of  *dukkha ariya saccâ* (the Noble Truth of Suffering), of the *samudaya ariya saccâ* (the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering), of the *nirodha ariya saccâ* (the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering), and of the *magga ariya saccâ* (the Noble Truth of the  Path),  where  all  the  sufferings  have  ceased,  the  *nibbâna*,  truely  by  the  right understanding (*sammâ ditthi*), I would acqui.r e freedom f.r om the suffering of the cycle of  rebirth", then what he said is the reality (*Sam*.-3:384; *Sam*.-3: 394).  

With an example it was again explained as 

*Bhikkhus* .... If any one said "I am going to build a house with lower (and 

foundation) parts.  first after which its upper storey will be made."  Then  what he has said will happen (*Sam*.-3-394).  

*Bhikkhus* .... If any said "I will make a cup using leaves of lotus,  dipterocarpus tahnedm g awse e-taaru okr n(aam beitntet"r,- ttahsetnin wg hleata vhee  suasiedd  isin a  mtraukthin (g*S* *a*s*m*o. u.-p3):  t3o8 4ca).r r y  water, and I will use 

*Bhikkhus*  ....  In  the  same  way  as  these  examples,  if  any  one  said  "  With penetrative  knowledge  of  my  own,  of  the  Four  Noble  Truth  truely  by  the  right understanding (*sammâ ditthi*), I would erad.i cate completely the suffering of the cycle of 

` `rebirth."  Such a statement is a reality (*Sam*.-3: 383-384). 

Again the Lord has expatiated as follows. 

- . 

`           `*Tasmâ hita bh*.*i* *kkhave* "*idam dukkhan*"*ti yogo karaniyo* ." *ayam dukkhasamudayo*"*ti yogo karaniyo,* "*ayam dukkhan*.*o* *rodho*"*ti yog*.*o*  *karaniyo,* "*ayam dukkhanirodhagâminî  patipadâ*"*ti yogo karaniyo* (*Sam*.-3: 384; *Sam*.-3: 394). 

*Bhikkhave* .... in this *desanâ*, therefore, you should make effort to know that 

1. "This the Noble Truth of Suffering." 
1. "This is the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering." 
1. "This is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering." 
1. " This is the Noble T.r uth of the P.a th leading to the *nibbâna*, the Cessation of         the Suffering." (*Sam*-3: 384; *Sam*.-3: 394). 

In these suttan the Buddha has insisted the followers to make effort to understand the Four Noble Truth.  Therefore, those who want to escape from the suffering of the cycle of rebirth must be determined to make effort to understand the Four Noble Truth to  be able to escape from the recurrent of suffering of rebirth. 

The following is the answer to as to how the penetrative knowledge can be  acquired of the Four Noble Truth. 

***Vattasaccâ*** — ***Vivattasaccâ*** 

- . 

*Tattha purimâni dve saccâni vattam, pacchimâni vattam. Tesu bhikkhuno vatte*  *kammathânâbhivesohoti, vivatte natthi abhiniveso* (*Abhi*.-*Tha*.-2: 109; *Dî*-*Tha*.-3: 160). 

Of these Four Noble Truth the previous Noble Truth of Suffering and Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering  are the *vattasaccâ* (the Truth of Suffering).  The Noble Truth of Cessation of Suffering and Noble Truth of the Path, of the later occurrence, are the *vivattasaccâ* (the Truth of Eradication of Suffering, the *Nibbâna*).  Of these two, the *vattasaccâ* and *vattasaccâ*, *vivattasaccâ* is the object of meditation (*vipassana* exercise) for the practicing monks = concentration.  No meditation = concentration is made on the  *vivattasaccâ* as the object of meditation (*Abhi*.-*Tha*.-2: 109; *Dî*-*Tha*.-3: 160). 

In  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  by  the  above  Commentaries,  the practicing individuals should take the Noble Truth of Suffering and the Noble of Truth of the Cause of Suffering of the Four Noble Truth as the object of concentration.  Effort must be made to concentrate on these by means of *uggahapativedha*, *savanapativedha* and *dhâranapativedha*, called knowledge by learning, and *sammasanapativedha* referred to as *vipassanâ ñân*. *a* (insight knowledge) to know penetratively = knowledge acquired via practice.  Once successful by knowledge acquired from learning, the Noble Truth of Suffering and Noble  Truth of Cause of  Suffering  are cultured and taken to heart by insight knowledge so that the knowledge through practice is attained.  Now a further  explanation will be made of the Noble ruth of Suffering and the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering. 

**The Doctrine of the Noble Truth of Suffering** 

**(The *Dhamma* of *Dukkha Ariya Saccâ*)** 

*Katamañca bhikkhave dukkham*.  *ariyasaccam*. *.  "Pañcupâdânakkhandhâ"tissa vacanîyam*. *. Rûpupâdânakkhandho vedanupâdânakhhandho saññupâpânakkhandho sankhârûpâdâ-*

*nakkhandho viññânupâdânakkhandho.  Idam*.  *vuccati bhikkhave dukkham*.  *aruyasaccam*.*   

. 

(*Sam*.-3: 373; *Khandhasuttan*) 

*Bhikkhus* .... What is the *Dhamma* of the Noble Truth of Suffering?  The answer should be *Upâdânakkhandhâ* (the factor of -5-Fold Clinging to Existence).  What then are *the upâdânakhhandâ*?  They are *rûpupâdânakkhandha* (the Aggregate of the Matter), *vedanupâdânakkhandhâ* (the Aggregate of the Sensation), *saññupâdânakkhandhâ* ( the Aggregate of perception), *sankhârupâdânakhandhâ* (the Aggregate of mental formation or reaction) and *viññânupâdhânakkhandhâ* (the Aggregate of consciousness).  *Bhikkhus*  

These Five Aggregates are the *Dhamma* of the Noble Truth of Suffering (*Sam*. .-3: 373;  *Khandhasuttan*). 

According  to  this  *desanâ*,  note  that  *rûpupâdânakkhandha,  vedanupâdânak- khandhâ, saññupâdânakkhandhâ, sankhârupâdânakhandhâ,*  *viññânupâdhânakkhandhâ*,  referred to as the Five-Fold *Upâdânakkhandhâ* are the Noble Truth of Suffering.

*ayam viccati rûpupâdânakkhandha* (*Sam*.-3: 39; *Khandhâsuttan*). 

*Bhikkhave* .... The root of the object of cankers, *Ãsava*, (situated in the 31 Planes), the erroneous craving such as "I, mine, etc." are 

1. All the past material factors, 
1. All the future material factors, 
1. All the present material factors, 
4. All the internal material factors, 
4. All the external material factors, 
4. All the gross material factors, 
4. All the delicate material factors, 
4. All the ignoble (inferior) material factors, 
4. All the Noble material factors, 
4. All  the  distant material factors  (far  from the  intelligence of  the meditating individual), 
4. All  the  nearby  material  factors  (nearby  the  intelligence  of  the  meditating individual). 
- All these 11 existing as material factors are to be called *rûpupâdânakkhandha*  etc. (*Sam*.:-2: 39). 

*Vedanupâdânakkhandha* etc. are also expatiated in a similar way. Therefore, the wrong understanding, which is the root of the object of canker, *Ãsava*, such as "I, mine", of the 11 classes of *upâdânakkhandhâ* existing as material factors are the Dhamma of Noble Truth of Suffering.  This must be respectfully  accepted as is preached by the Buddha.  

Included in this *upâdâdankkhandhâ* are the Five *Upâdânakkhandha* of Past and of Future.  How are they contemplated?  By *paccekkha ñâ*.*n* *a* (practical knowledge) or  *anvaya ñâna* (theoretical knowledge)?  The answer is as given below. 

*Dassanap*. *pabhâvum*.  *hi upâdâyâ ñân*. *a samñgî puggalo cakkhunâ rûpâni, ñân*. *ena vivatte  dhamme passati* (*Itivattaka*-*Tha*. 310). 

***Jânato**tivâ vatvâ na jhânanam*.  *anussavâkâraparivitakkamattavasena idhâdhippetam*. *, attha kho rûpâni viya cakkhuññânena rûpâdîni,  tesa*.*m* .  *ca samudayâdike*.  *paccekhe katvâ* 

` `*dassananti vibhavetom "**passato**"ti vuttanti evum vâ ettha atto (Sam.*-*Tî.-*2: 63). 

As a man sees the material bodies by physical eye, a meditator sees the *dhamma* of the Noble Truth of Suffering and the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering by virtue of insight knowledge called the *paccekkha ñâ*.*n* *a*, the ultimate truth of the nature of the object  of  concentration,  which  can  be  visioned  in  its  true  nature  by  the  power  of knowledge due to right understanding created by *vipassanâ* (meditation).  To emphasize the essen. ce of the meaning ***passato*** is added after preaching as *jhânato* (*Itivattaka*-*Tha*.:  310; *Sam*.-Tî-2: 63). 

[Note.  The Noble Truth of Cause of Suffering, which is the true Cause of the Five-Fold Material of Birth of the *dhamma* of the present Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering based on the Five-Fold Clinging to Existence.  And they are part of the material  body of the past.  It will become clear in the Section on *Samudaya Saccâ*]. 

If it is so then should the past and future factors be not meditated by means of  *anvya ñâ*.*n* *a*?  The answer is as follows. 

- .  . 

*Nayadassanvasendai svvââ e avtuthma  vauttattaâmn*.*â*  *gPaateth naavyaanmh*.*ñ*  *ni eptai c*(*Mcuaphpâatnî.a-*2*d*:*h* 4*a*2*m*3*m*).*â* *tam udayabbaya*  

It can be put in another way by *Nayadassana* (for the purpose of seeing).  To begin with, *udayabbaya* (the arising and perishing away) of  present factors (*paccupan- nadhamma*) are by exercised by *paccakha* (pactically).  The past and future *dhammas* are  later practiced in this way (*Pyî. Visuddimagganissaya* – 5: 265). 

Care must be taken of the fact that in taking *udayabbaya* of the present *dhammas*,  the folowing are to be included. 

1. *Paccayato udayabbaya* (founded on arising and perishing away).  Because of the  distinct causes such as ignorance, craving, attachment, causative factors, action etc., the resultant five material factors etc. of the Five-Fold Material Factors are clearly formed.  The arising and perishing away due to distinct causes such as ignorance,  craving,  *upâdan*,  *sankhâra*  and  *kamma*  ceasing  by  nature  of *anuppâdanirodha*, the resultant five material factors come to cease by nature of *anuppâdanirodha*. 
1. *Khanato  udayabbaya*  (momentary  arising  and  perishing  away)  =  momentary formation  and  dissolution  of  the  five  resultant  five-fold  material  factors.   In another way — [*Sappaccayanâmarûpapvasena tilakkhanam âropetvâ* (*Ma*.-*Th*a.- 1: 281)].  Arising and perishing away of the cause and result referred to as  

`       `*udayabbaya*. 

Hence the resultant Five *upâdânakkhandhâ* are the *dhamma* of the Truth of Suffering.   

The causes *avijjâ, tahnâ, upâdan, sankhâra* and *kamma* are the *dhamma* of the Truth of  Cause  of  Suffering.   The  two  kinds  of  *udayabbaya*:  *paccayato  udayabbaya*  and *khanatoudayabbaya*, of the Truth of Suffering and Truth of the Case of Suffering seen by means of *paccakkha* called *vipassanâ dhamma ditthi* (right understanding of insight).  When visioned in this way, the past and future are contemplated in a similar way by 

`  `*anvaya* *ñâna*.  This is the answer to the above query. 

***Abiññan* and *Vipassanâ* (Power and Meditation)** 

1. A  statement  that  past  can  be  concentrated  by  *pubbenivâsânussati  abhiññan* (higher wisdom of rememberance of one’s former state of existence), 
1. A statement that the future can be cincentrated by *anâgata ñâ*.*n* *a* (knowledge yet 

`      `to come), which is a part of *dibbacakkhu abhiññana* (the Heavenly eye). 

These two statements are acceptable on the basis of factual substance.  The fact 

` `that the past and future (the Five Aggregate) can be contemplated by *vipassanâ ñâna* (insight  knowledge)  is  not  satisfactorily  acceptable.   With  regard  to  the  latte. r, *Sammâsambuddha* (the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha) himself has expounded in the opening of the doctrines as follows. 

*Yehi ti keci bhikkhave samanâ vâ byamanâ vâ anekavihitam*.  *pubbenuvâsam*.  *anussaramânâ anussarantia,ñ sñaabtbaertaem* .*p*  *a*(*Knchuapjjpaândiyhaâ nsaukttkahma*. )*n*.*d*  *he anussaranti etesam vâ*

*Vedanâdisupi eseva nayo (Sam.-Tha.-*2: 266).

***Vipassanâvasenâ**ti etarehi rûpavedanâdayo anussâritvâ* “*Pubbepâham evum vedanâ*  

` `***ahosiñ**ti atîtânam*.  *rû*.*p* *avedanâdipam*.  *paccuppannehi v*. *isesâbhavadassan*. *â vipassanâ,  tassâ vipassanâya vasena (Sam*. *.-Tî.-*2: 235).* 

*Bhikkhus* .... If *samana* and *byamana* reminisce along aseries material body or bodies of the past, they can do so by virtue of their knowledge.  Those *samana* and *byamana* who can reminisce, by virtue of.  their knowledge, can dos so of all the Five-Fold  Material Factor or each one of these (*Sam*.-2: 71; *Khajjaniya suttan)*. 

In using the term *pubbenivâsa* (reminsicent of the past) in this text, the Buddha does not mean the rememberance of of the previous life by  power of *pubbenivâsânus- satiabhiññâna* (reminiscent of the former birth).  If the Buddha, however, does mean *pubbenivâsânussatiabhiññâna*, then *pubbenivâsa* has been used referring to *samana* (a monk or one who has eradicated defilements)  and *byamana* (a *brahmana*).  It is because  of this that the Buddha expounded as: 

“*Sabbete pañpâdânakkhandhe anussaranti etesam*.  *vâ añataram*. .” 

"The *samana* and *byamana* who can reminisce by virtue of the order of the Five-Fold Material Factors and each of these individually, can do so by virtue of knowledge."  The 

` `reason for this preaching is as given below: 

To the *samana* and byamana who can reminisce the material factors of previous birth by virtue of  *pubbenivâsânupana abhiññâna* 

1. The Five-Fold Material Bodies included in the supra-mindane *dhamma*. 
1. The Five-Fold Clinging to Existence not included in the supra-mundane *dhamma*, 
1. The body-related racial characters, physical features, nutrient, *sukha* (mental ease), *dukkha* (suffering) etc., and 
1. The perception of various names 

are the object of *pubbenivâsânussati abhiññañ*. 

The Buddha, on the other hand, does not expatiate that these above four factors 

can  be  reminisced  orderly.   The  Lord  only  indicates  that  the  Five-Fold  Clinging  to Existence or any one of these Five of the previous birth can be reminisced.  Therefore, the Buddha does not mean can be made of the material factors of the former birth by means  of  *pubbenivâsânussati  abhiññañ*.   The  Buddha  only  means  that  *Paramattha dhamma sabhâva* (the nature of the ultimate *dhammas*) can be reminisced by *vipassanâ* *ñâna* (insight knowledge).  What it all means is that *rûpa*, *vedanâ*, *saññâ*, *sankhâra,* *viñ*.*ñ* *añ* etc., which have ceased in the past, can be recollected by the insight knowledge 

` `(*Sam*. .-2: 71; *Sam*. .-*Tha*.-2: 266). 

***Vipassanâvasena* = Power of *Vipassanâ*** 

After *rûpa*, *vedanâ*, *saññâ*, *sankhâra* and *viññañ* of the present have been recol- lected = being analytically concentrated —"In the long past life also, I have had *rûpa*,  *vedanâ*, *saññâ*, *sankhâra* and *viññañ*" — these past factors were similar to those of the present.  There is *vipassanâ ñân*. *a* which can vision the fact, such as "In the long past life also, I have had *rûpa*, *vedanâ*, *saññâ*, *sankhâra* and *viññañ*", that there is no difference between the past and the present *rûpa*, *vedanâ*, *viññañ* and *sankhâra*.  T. his means that the  material factors that existed in the past can be recollected in order (*Sam*.-Tî.-2: 235). 

These are the evidences from the doctrines indicating the differences between the powers of *pubbenivâsanussati abhiññâ* and *vipassanâ ñâ*.*n* *a*, are to be concentrated and can  be  concentrated  by  virtue  of  *vipassanâ  ñâ*.*n* *a*.   Now  in  continuation,  rules  and regulation followed by people of olden days by means of which past and future factors  are meditated will be presented. 

**Notes from *Anusaya Suttan*** 

Then Râhulâ approached the Buddha, paid homage, get seated at an appropriate  place, and put to the Lord the following question. 

My Lord .... In what way should one know and and see so that the clinging "I" = wrong view, the attachment "mine" =  *tahnâ* (craving), latent boastfullness = conceit,  would not occur in the body living or non-living and arising signs together with *viññâna*?

1. Râhulâ .... That all material things of the past and future, which occur internally or externally, which ae coarse = *olarika*, which are subtle = *sukhuma*, which are inferior = *hîna*, superior = *panita*, which are far = *dure*, near = *santika* are seen and known as =  "*Netam mama*, *nesomahasmi*, *na meso attâ*." 
- This material body is not I, this material body is not I.  This material body is not 

mine or not myself.  By means of *vipassanâ ñân*. *a* (insight knowledge) and *Magga ñâ*.*n* *a*  (Path knowledge) these are seen precisely as they truely are. 

2. Feeling = That all Suffering .... R. 
2. Perception = That all perceptions .... R. 
2. Formation = That all the arising of mind and mental factors .... R. 
2. Conscious Mind = That all the cognitions .... R. 

Râhulâ .... Only in those who know and see in this way the internal, the external, living and non-living and arising signs of perception of I = the wrong view, clinging like 

` `mine = *tahnâ*, latent boastfullness = conceit will not arise (*Sam*. .-1. : 444; *An*.*u* *saya sut*.*t* *an*) 

***Netam mama nesoha masmi na meso attâti samanupassâmi**ti aniccam dukkham*  

*anattâtisamanupassâmi* (*Ma.*-*Tha*.-4: 232; *Channovâda suttan atthakathâ*). 

In accordance with is opening of the Commentary, note that meditation on the five *upâdânakkhandha* (the Five-Fold clinging to the Existence) of the past and future as  the object - *netam mama, nesohamasmi na meso attâ* - and meditation on the general  

. 

` `characters such as *anicca* (impermanence), *dukkha* (suffering) and *anatta* (non-self) as the object are the same.  In so meditating, the  five-fold  clinging to  existence of the present, past and future as object are all included in concentrating on these five.  In meditating on the five-fold *upâdânakkhandhâ*, existing as 11 classes, the question arises as to which *ñâna* (knowlege) is involved, *paccakkha ñâna* or *anvaya ñâna*.  See the  following Atha. kathâ (Commentary) Tîkâ (Book of Mean. ing) opening fo.r  the answer. 

***Sammappaññ***(*S**â**a**y**m**a***.***  .***p***-*T**as**h**s**a**a**.*-***ti***2** *s*: *a*1*h*9*a*7* ;*v* *Aipnausssaaynaâ ySau tmtaang gAattphaañkñaâthyâa*) *s*. *utthu passati*

. 

*Sammappaññâyapassati* = vision by.  the right knowledge means vision by  insight  knowledge and Noble Path knowledge (*Sam*.-*Tha*.-2: 197). 

In *vipassanâ* prior to the Noble Path, the Five-Fold Clinging to Existence, existing as 11 classes, as the object are analytically concentrated.  By virtue this concentration the impermanent, suffering and non-self characters of the five-fold *upâdânakkhandhâ* are seen penetratively by one's own self through the right insight vision called *attapaccakkha ñân*. *a*.   In  the  case  of  Noble  Path  moment  (*ariyamaggakhana*),  the  five-fold *upâdânakkhandhâ*,  existing  as  11  classes,   and  which  are  the  Truth  of  Suffering, contemplated via *kicca* *ditthi* (via penetrative understanding) penetrative knowledge of  *priññâbisamaya* (analytical understanding) by virtue of which *ariya magga sammâditthi* (right understanding of the Noble Path) called *attapaccakkha ñân*. *a* (acquired practical knowledge) the *upâdânakkhandhâ* are seen penetratively.  (The penetrative knowledge  without infatuation.  By reje.c tion of *moha* (dullness) which prevents the understanding 

` `the Truth of Suffering) (*Sam*.*Tî*.-2: 181). 

N.B.  The insight knowledge, which has the ability to mentally culture the the factors of 

` `Five-Fold Clinging to Existence as the object, has been  explained as ***attapaccakkha ñâna***.  When the factors of impermanence, of suffering and of non-self of the presently cul**.**t** ured *dhammas* have been accomplished, the *dhammas* of the past and future, but are  not presently cultured, can also be meditated in the same way by means of *anvaya ñâna*. 

**Notes from *Mahârâhulvâda Suttan***  . 

Once Râhulâ,, following the Buddha, went into the town of Savatthi for alms reception.  Râhulâ, who was interested in becoming the elder son of the King Cakkavatta,  was admonished by the Buddha. 

*sukhumam*.  *vâ hînam vâ panîtam*.  *vâ yam*.  *dure santike v*.*â* *, sabb*. *am rûpam* '*netam mama,* "*Yam kinci Râhula r*.*u* *pam atîtânâgatapaccuppannam ajjattam vâ*.  *bahid*.*d* *hâ vâ* .*o* *lâka vâ* 

- .  . 

*nesohamasmañ, na neso attâ'ti evumetam*.  *yatthâbhutam sammappaññâya dathaabbam*"  

(*Ma*.-2: 84). 

Râhulâ .... That all material beings of the past and future, which occur internally or externally, which are coarse = *olarika*, which are subtle = *sukhuma*, which are inferior 

- *hîna*,.  superior = *panita*, which are far = *dure*, near = *santika* are seen and known as =  "*Netam mama*, *nesomahasmi*, *na meso attâ*."  "This material body is not I, this material body is not I.  This material body is not mine." (= concentrated as *anicca*, *dukkha* and *anatta*).  Meditate the truth in this way by right *vipassanâ ñâ*.*n* *a* (*Magga paññâ* or the  Path knowledge) (*Ma*.-2: 84). 

It has been instructed to concentrate on the *vednâ*, *saññâ*, *sankhâra* and *viñañ* of  the four material body in a similar way (*Ma*.-2: 84). 

Here too all the *paccakkha ñâna*, called *vipassanâ sammâditthi* and *ariya magga sammâditthi* are mentally cultured via *sammappaññâya*.  At the time when the Buddha expounded *Mahârâhula suttan*, Râhulâ was a laity only 18 years of age.  It must be noted that, because of this condition, it was instructed that in concentrating on the Five-Fold Clinging on the Existence (the five *upâdânakkhandhâ*) existing as the past, the future and the present etc. of 11 classes attempt must first be made to arrive at *attapaccakkha ñâna*  called *vipassanâ sammâ ditthi*.   

**Notes on *Anattalakkhana Suttan*** 

In scriptures in Pâli are many doctrines instructing to meditate on the past and future *upâdânakkhandhâ*.  From among these doctrines, some will be extracted from the  *Anattalakkhan Suttan* which will be most relevent and familiar to  you. 

The  Buddha  explained  to *sotapana*  (those who  have entered the  stream),  and being mominated as *pañcavaggî* (a company of five) about the impossibility of the five corporeality to follow one's own wish called *avasavattanattha* (powerless to obligate one's whishes) = the nature of *anatta* (non-self).  After this explanation, question and answer on the five corporeality in the form of *anicca*, *dukkha* and *anatta* individually.  When the Company of Five (*pañcavaggî*) have presented that the five corporeality are only the *dhammas* of *anicca*, *dukkha* and *annata*, the Buddha instructed the object of  mental culture as follow. 

*bahiddhTâa svmâ âo ltâîhriak abmh*.*i*  *kvkâh sauvkeh* .*u*..*m*. "*aYm*.*a*  *mv*.*â*  *k hiñîncai mr*.*û*  *vpâa my*.*a*  *amt*.*î*  *tdâunrâeg vaâta spaanctcikuep pvaân, asam*.*b*  *baajjma*. *t traûmp*. *a vmâ*.   *mam*.*a* *, nesohasmi, na neso attâ*"*ti evametam*.  *yatthâbhutam*.  *sammappaññâya datthabham*.*   

(*Sam*.-2: 56). 

*Bhikkhus* .... the Five Aggregates are only the *dhammas* of *anicca*, *dukkha* and *anatta* and, therefore, in this teaching (doctrine of the Buddha) my sons, meditate on the  following in their true nature by *vipassanâ paññâ* and *magga paññâ*. 

All the *dhammas* of the material things of the past, future and present, all the internal factors occurring inside your life continuum, and those that occur external to you, coarse and subtle material factors, inferior and superior factors, all the far and nearby 

` `material factors, existing as 11 classes. 

These are mentally cultured "*netam*.  *mama, nesohamasmi*, *na meso atta*" as 

1. This material body is not mine (= as suffering) 
2. This material body is not I (= as impermanence) 
2. This material body is not myself ( as non-self)  (*Sam*. .-2: 56). 

In the 4-Fold Mental Factors (the *Four Namakkhandhâ*), such as *vedanakkhandhâ* (the Aggregate of Feeling) etc., are also instructed by Buddha to be meditated in a similar way. 

In this way the Five Aggregate of the past and future are included in *vipassanâ* exercise as described in the *desanâ* of this *Anattlakkhana Suttan*.  In accordance with these instructions, the members of *pañcavaggiya* (refers to the her Three Path High Factors for members *pañcavaggiya*) arrived at *attapaccakkha ñâna*, referred to as *magga*  

` `*sammâditthi ñâna* by meditating on the five *upâdânakkhandhâ*.  (which always follows desanâ knowled.g e) existing as 11 classes by virtue of exercise in *vipassanâ*.  Because of this exercise these members, who are named *pañcavaggiya*,  in the wake  of accomplish- ment of *Anattalakkhana Suttan* attained the *Arahatta Phala* (Fruit as the attainment of the  last and highest stage of the Path). 

. 

*Imasmiñ ca pana vayâkaranasmiñ bhaññâmâne* .*b* *hikkhunam anupâdhâya âsavehi cittâni  vimussinsu* (*Sam.*-2: 56). 

Only the meaning of *Anattalakkhana Suttan*, but not the verse, was expatiated to the members of *pañcavaggiya* and they were not  attached to the five *upâdânakkhandhâ* any more  by the wrong understanding of I, mine, etc. but released from *âsava* totally  (*Sam.*-2: 56). 

Instruction  of the meditation on *anicca*, *dukkha* and *anatta* alternately in the form of question and answer is referred to as *Teparivattadhamma desanâ*.  Hundreds of similar *Teparivattadhamma  desanâ* are  present  in  the  Buddha's  doctrine.   Most of  these are found  in  *Khandhavaggasamyut*.  The  Buddha,  the  compassionate  and  the  completely enlightened, has repeatedly instructed these, and those practicing individuals who are  willing to acquire *nibbâna dhammas* should obediently follow these instructions. 

At this instant, of the Four Noble Truth described in *Ãsavakkhaya Suttan*, *Dukkha* 

*Ariya Saccâ* (the Noble Truth of Suffering has been explicitly explained.  Now again   (*Samudaya Ariya Saccâ*) the Noble Truth of Arising of Suffering will be dealt with. 

***Samudaya Ariya Saccâ*** 

(The *Dhamma* of the Noble Truth of Arising of Suffering) 

In the *Abhihammâ* (*Abhi*.-2: 211-215) *Saccavibañ* of *Vibañ Pâli*, the Buddha has 

expatiated  

1. *Tahnâ* (craving) as the Truth of Arising, 
1. *Tahnâ* together with all the *kilesa* (defilements) as the Truth of Arising, 
1. *Tahnâ*, *kilesa* together with all *akusala* (ill deeds) as the Truth of Arising, 
1. All the factors of *akusala*, and *alobha* (disinterestedness), *adosa* (amity) and *amoha* (non-delusioned) = the three factors of primary *kusala* (good deeds) which are the root of all *âsava* factors and which make all beings go round and round in the cycle of rebirth as the Truth of Arising, 
5. All that is *akusala* and the *kusala* which is the root of factors which make all beings  go round and round in the cycle of rebirth as the Truth of Arising. 

The Truth of Arising (*samudaya saccâ)* has been classified by five methods in this way.  Referring to this *desanâ* *Sammohavinodanî Atthakathâ* and *Visuddhi Magga*  *Atthakathâ* have explained as follows. 

- . 

*Tattha yasmâ kusalâkusalakammam avisesena samudayacassanti saccavibañge vattam* (*Abhi.-Tha*.-2: 185; *Visuddhi*-2: 216). 

- All the *kuso* (good deeds) and *akuso* (bad deeds) are  indicated as *cetanâ* (volition), *cetanâsampayuttadhamma*, especially in general as *samudaya saccâ* (Truth of Arising),  by the Buddha in *Saccavibhañ Pali* text (*Abhi.-Tha*.-2: 185; *Visuddhi*-2: 216). 

In such doctrines as *Vibañ and Dhammacakka* (Wheel of the Doctrine) the *tahnâ*  (the craving) has been admonished as *samudaya saccâ*.  This was made so to give as an 

example by extracting a fact in the direction of explanation being given.  A mature seed, with its moisture and starch contents still intact, will grow into a plant of its own kind when planted in a soil with necessary factors like water, soil, favorable weather and light.  So also with the support of *tahnâ* (craving) a life would result, the kind of life which corresponds to the action of *kuso* (good deeds) or akuso (bad deeds).  A burnt seed is depleted of its moisture and starchy contents, and the power to grow into a plant is lost. So too the life of noble individuals, in whose material and mental continuum the *kuso* and *akuso* accompanied by *tahnâ* called *kilesa* (defilement) once resided, will no longer be able to come into being.   Therefore, in the arising of a life, called the Truth of Suffering, the primary directing force for such a life and such and such object of attachment are the primary cause.  That is the reason why the Buddha expatiated that primarily tahnâ is the 

` `Truth of Suffering.  The same applies to Nos. 2, 3, and 4 mentioned above. 

The fifth method (of the above mentioned), in which all *kuso* and *akuso* (good and bad deeds) actions are indicated as the Truth of Suffering, is the method of *Nippadesa* (separately) by the Truth of Suffering are completely treated without leaving a trace  untouched.  Again in *Añgutthora* *Pali,* *Tikanibatti*, *Titthâyatana Suttan*, the Lord has expounded as follows. 

**Notes from *Titthâyatana Suttan*** 

*sanKkahtâarmaapñaccac abyhâi kvkihñañvâen admu*. *k, kvhiñañsaâmnampuadcacayayâm*.*   *naârmiyaarsûapcacma*.*m* *,*.*  *n, âavmijaj ârpûapcaapyaâc csaaynâk hsâarlâay, a-* .

Idam vuccati bhikkhave ariyasaccam* (*Am.*-1: 178). 

`         `Bhikkhus ....  What is *Samudaya Ariya Saccâ* (the Noble Truth of Arising) that causes  the  *dukkha*  (suffering)?   Because  of  *avijjâ*  (ignorance)  *sankhâra*  is  formed. Because of *sankhâra*, *viññâña* (concept) is formed.  Because of the concept mind and material factors are formed.  Because of the formation of the mind and material factors *sa*.*l* *âyatana* (sense as the object) is formed.  Because of *sa*.*l* *âyatana* formation *phassa* (touching or contact) is formed.  Because of *phassa vedanâ* (feeling) is formed.  Because of formation of *phassa* *tahnâ* (craving) is formed.  Because of *tahnâ upâdana* (grasping) 

. 

is formed.  Because of grasping a life is formed.  Because of life formation birth results.  Because of birth *jarâ* (ageing), *marana* (death and decay), *soka* (grief), *pariveda* (crying), *dukkha* (suffering), *domanassa* (mental pain), and *upâyâsa* (turbulent factors) come into existence.  In this way the nature of the cause and of formation of a multitude of *dukkha*, which are non-*sukha*-inducing make their appearance.  Bhikkhus .... The nature of this cause-result relationship = *Paticca samuppâda* (the Causal relationship) should be called  the Noble Truth of Causes of Arising which is the cause of suffering (*Am.*-1: 178). 

A meditator, who wish to be relieved of the cycle of rebirth, must try to vision penetratively the four *Ariya Saccâ* (the Four Noble Truth) by *sammâ ditthi ñâna* (the knowledge of right understanding).  He should not forget that among these Four Truth are  also included the cause-result relationship the *Paticca samuppâda* which is the truth of   *samuTdaat*H*tyha*o*a*.* w *s aa* *yc*th*ac*e*sâ* *m* *S*(t*âa*h *ck*e*cu* *â* *s*T *a*(rT*l*u*â*rt*k*uh*u*t oh*s*f*a*)  *l*Ai*a*s *k*rCi*a*su*m*inl*m*tgu)*a*r.e *m*.d*   *a*in*v* *i*t*s*h*e*e*s* *e*C*n*h*a*a *s*r*a*ac*m*te*u*r*d* *a*o*y*f *aPsaatcicccaan tsi asmacmcuapvâibdaañ* *ge*.*

***saccappabhavato** viññâtabbam yathâraham* (*Abhi.-*2: 185; *Visuddhi*-2: 216-217). 

In Saccavibañ Pâli all the *kuso* and *akuso* functions, which are created (*cetanâ*, *cetanâ*-related *sampayutta dhamma* etc., are not particularly differentiated), are generally expounded by the Buddha to be *samudaya saccâ* too.  Therefore, when the 12 classes of 

` `*paticca samuppâda* (the causal relaionship), are categorized by way of *saccâ* (the Truth) 

`          `*Avijjâ*, *sankhâra,* *tahnâ*, *upâdana*, *kammabhava* are the groups of *samudaya saccâ*.  It is the *dutiya saccâ* (the second truth *dhamma*). 

*Viññâna*, *nâmarûpa*, *sa*.*l* *ayatana* (the sense as object), *phassa* (contact), *vedanâ* (feeling), *upapattibhava* (resultant way of next life) such as *jâti* (birth), *jarâ* (ageing) and *marana* (death and decay), which are the factors of *vipâka vatta* (functions of the effects of one's action) are all grouped as  *dukkha saccâ* (the truth of suffering).  This is *pathama*  *saccâ* (the first truth).  In short, note these in this way. 

In the case of *avijjâ paccayâ sankhârâ* (ignorance based on mental formation), the *avijjâ* (ignorance) is the *samudaya saccâ*, so also is the *sankhâra*.  Therefore, all the factors of mental formation, formed due to *avijjâ*, are the *avijjâ* called *samudaya saccâ*, from which originated the *sankhâra* referred to as *samudaya saccâ*.  This is said to be the  *dutiya saccâ* of the *dutiya* *saccâ* origin. 

. 

In the case of *sakhâra paccayâ viññâna*.*m*  (*sankhâra* based on cognition), the  *sankhâra* is the *samudaya saccâ*, and *viññânam* is the *dukkha saccâ*. 

In the case of *vedanâ paccayâ tahnâ* (*vedanâ* based on craving), vedanâ is the *dukkha saccâ*.  Craving is the *samudaya saccâ* (the truth of arising).  *Tahnâ* derived from the *vedanâ* is the *dutiya saccâ* (second truth) originating from the  *pathama saccâ* (the  first truth) (= *dukkha saccâ*).  

In the case of *tahnâ paccayâ upâdânam* (craving based on *upâdâna*) Tahnâ as well as *upâdâna* are *samudaya saccâ*.   Therefore, *upâdâna* derived from craving is the *dutiya saccâ* (= *samudaya saccâ*) from which originated the *dutiya saccâ* (*samudaya  saccâ*).** 

In *upâdâna paccayâ bhavo* (life based on *upâdâna*) *upâdâna* is *samudaya saccâ*. The *kammabhava* (sensual existence) is the *samudaya saccâ*.  The *upapattibhava* (life due to rebirth) is *dukkha saccâ*.  Therefore, life derived from attachment is the *dutiya*  *saccâ* (= *samudaya saccâ*) from which originated the  *pathama cassâ dutiya saccâ*. 

In *bhava paccayâ jâti* (the rebirth based on *bhava*) *bhava* = *kamma bhava* is the *samudaya* *saccâ*.  *Jâti* is the *dukkha saccâ*.  Therefore, rebirth derived from the sensual  existence is *dukkha saccâ* (= *samudaya saccâ*) on which *pathama saccâ* has it origin.

` `originates *pathama saccâ* (= *dukkha saccâ*) (*Abhi*.*Tha*.-2: 185; *Visuddhi*-2: 216-217). 

According to these expositions *avijjâ*, *tahnâ*, *upâdâna*, *sankhâra* and *kamma* are all *dhammas* of *samudaya saccâ*.  *Viññañ*, *nâma*, *rûpa*, *salâyana*, *phassa*, and *devadanâ*  are groups *dhammas* of *dukkha saccâ*.  These are to be understood this way.

In accordance with the above opening of the doctrines which, with reference to *Patisambhidâ Magga*, have described, and have to noted as 

1. When sensual existence was created, the five causes cultured in the past, such       as *avijjâ*, *tahnâ*, *upâdâna*, *sankhâra* and *kamma*, which are the truth of arising  

`     `due to which the five present results, which are the truth of suffering, such as  

`     `*viññâna*, *nâma*, *rûpa* *sal*.*â*  *yatana*, *phassa*, *vedanâ* etc, have appeared vividly. 

2. The five present causes, such as *avijjâ*, *tahnâ*, *upâdâna*, *sankhâra* and *kamma*,      

cultured in the present existence, which are the truth of arising due to which 

the five future results which are the truth of suffering, such as *viññâ*.*n* *a*, *nâma*,       *rûpa* *sa*.*l* *âyatana*, *phassa*, *vedanâ* etc, will also appear vividly. 

As a man would see the physical objects via consciousness by way of sight, so would a meditator endowed with *vipassanâ sammâditthi ñân*. *a* (the insight knowledge of right understanding) see the nature of the present results due to the past causes, and future 

results because of the present causes.  The above **Upanisa Suttan** *athakathâ* .*t* *îkâ* and **Ãsavakkhaya Suttan** *athakathâ* have explained how a meditator can see the nature the 

causal relationship of the past causes and present results, the present causes and the future results  by  ***paccekkha  ñân*. *a***  (paractical  knowledge)  called  the  *vipassanâ  sammâditthi ñâ*.*n* *a*. 

The Buddha has also admonished in Ãsavakkhaya Suttan that if nature of forma- tion  of  *dukkha  saccâ*  due  to  *samudaya  saccâ*  as  the  cause  cannot  be  aprreciated  by *sammâditthi ñân*. *a*, the *Ariya Magga* (the Right Path), where *dhammas* of *âsava* have been abolished, cannot be attained.  Therefore those, who are willing to acquire *nibbâna* appreciated via *Ariya Magga ñâna* and *Phala ñâ*.*n* *a* (the Path and Fruit knowledge), must try to penetratively know the fact that *dukkha saccâ* is formed due to *samudaya saccâ*. Put in another way, *samudaya ariya saccâ* (Noble Truth of Arising of Suffering) as the cause of *dukkha samudaya ariya saccâ* should by penetratively appreciated in its entity.  Following the attainment in this way of penetrative appreciation by practical knowledge, meditate on the *dhammas* of the past and future, which are *aditha* (not of present), by  *anvaya ñâna* (theoretical knowledge). 

**The Power of *Ñân*. *â-kkhanikakamma* (Various Unstable or Momentary Causes)** 

Among the five-fold causes of the past, which are the basic causes of the present existence,   five  *paccuppanbhava  pa*.*t* *isandhe  khandhâ*  (the  five-fold  materials  of  the present rebirth) etc., *kammabhava* (active or sensual life) = *kamma*  also is one of the  factors.  This *kamma*, by virtue of *ñâ*.*n* *â-kkhandhâ*, is the cause of *kamma dhammas*  which can be of help in formation of *vipâka khandhâ* (result of one's action).  Since the causative factors and the resultant factors appear at different period of time, (different temporary factors formed on the basis of *kamma*) *ñân*. *â*-*kkhanikapaccayakamma* = from the moment of the present resultant factors different *kamma* factor of the causes which have occurred at different moment.  Then the question is "When did this *kamma* factor of  the cause make its appearance?.  The answer is as given follows. 

***Kammapaccayenâ**ti anekânampi kappakotînam matthake attano phalam uppâdeton  samatthena nânâkkha*.*n* *ikakammapaccayenâti at*.*t* *ho*.  *Kusalâkusalañhi kam*. *mam*.  *attano* 

*pava*. *ttikkhane phalam na deti. Yadiyadeya. Yam manusso devalokûpagam kusalakam- mam karoti, tassânubhâ*.*v* *ena tasamañyeva khane devo bhaveya.  Yasamañ pana khane avijjamânampi kevalam kata*. *ttâyeva dittheva dhamme upapajje vâ pariyâye avasesa- paccayasamâyoge sati phalam uppâdeti niruddhâpi purimasappâdikiriyâ viya kâlantare* 

*pacchimasippâdikiriyâya. Tasmâ nânâkkhanikakammapaccayoti vuccati (Abhi-Tha.*-3:  374; *Pathâna atthakathâ).* 

`        `What ***kammapaccaya*** (formed by *kamma* as the cause) means is that, in not a single but even in tens of millions of worlds, actions that have been made in the previous life, and which could bring forth one's own results by virtue of *ñâ*.*n* *âkkhanikakammapaccaya* results of the different kinds momentary factors formed by *kamma* as the cause) could be  of supporting cause. 

**Reason**.  The *kusala and akusala kamma* (the good and bad deeds) in the forming stages,  as  *upâda-thî-bhañga  khana*  (arising-static-perishing  away  moments),  are  not powerful enough to give rise to resultant factors.  If these two momentary deeds could give rise to the resultant factors, then a wordling would cultivate *kusala* (good deed) which the cause for arriving at the heavenly abode.  If so, by virtue of that good deed, the wordling would attain a heavenly being during that cultivating moment.  But it was not to be so.  The possibility is that the deed has been cultivated at that moment.  During that cultivating moment, the good deed of the other moments do not  as yet exist as *upâda-thî- bhañga*.  But because the good deeds have been acquired as the sole action: 

1. If that *kamma* happens to be *ditthadhammavedanîya* action (the result that is to be  suffered  during  the  present  existence)  —  that  has  to  be  visualized  during *paccuppan bhava* (the present life) 
1. If that *kamma* happens to be *upapajjavedanîya* action (the result that is to be suffered during the second life adjacent to the present one) — that occurs during the second life immeditately following the present life 
1. If that kamma happens to be *aparâpariyavedanîya* action (the result that has to be suffered during neither the present nor second but the consecutive lives starting  from the third onwards, then — 

If it happens to be *kusala* (good deed) - or *gatisampatti, upadhisampatti, kâla- sampatti*, *akusala* (bad deed), and if they conspicuously combined with the remaining causes such as *gatisampatti, upadhisampatti, kâlasampatti*, then there can be a resultant factor (see *Abhi*.-*Tha*.-2: 421). 

The way it happens is this.  What has been learnt in early days would of assistance and helpful to the present learning, though the time period of the two are different.  In the  same way, culture of volition called *kamma* may not give rise to result at that instant, but would of helpful to produce result only in the later moments.  Therefore, *ñâ*.*n* *âkhanika* =  the *cetanâ* (volition) from moment of appearance of result to respective moments (of different moments) resultant formations (*Abhi*.-*Tha*.-3: 374; *Pathâna  Athakathâ*). 

***DUKKHA SACCÂ* AND *SAMUDAYA SACCÂ*** (The Truth of Suffering and of Arising of Suffering) 

The five *upâdânakkhandhâ* which existed as 11 classes of the past, future and present etc. are the *dukkha ariya saccâ* (Noble Truth of Suffering) and have clearly been explained above.  Now once again *samudaya saccâ* will be explained. 

On the basis of *samudaya saccâ* as the true cause of the five *upâdânakkhandhâ* of present existence, if the *tahnâ* (attachment) is taken as *samudaya saccâ* by method of *paRdûhpâânraû*, *p*th*a*e*m*.n*   *p*th*a*a*ñ*t*c* *taakhknhâa* *n*h*d*a*h*s *â*to*,*  *t*b*a*e*m*. a  *sh*n*ao*a*mt*l*i*y*u* z*dd*e*ua*d*ky* *ka*a*h* s*sa* *a*t*s*o*ca* *c*w*cac*h*ma*.e *m.*n.  ,  i*t*t*a* d*m*.i d *s* h*a*a*m*p*u*p*d*e*h*n*â* t*p*o*i* *k*o*â*c* c*p*u*u*r*r*.*i* *matahnâ*  

The *nâma rûpa* are the five corporeality.  Those five corporeality are the truth of suffering.  The (*tahnâ*) craving that has been cultured during previous existence, which  can cause the truth of suffering, is the *samudaya saccâ* (*Abhi*.*Tha*.-2: 68-69). 

As explained above, if  *avijjâ*, *tahnâ*, *upâdâna*, *sankhâra* and *kamma*, or *sankhâra* and *kamma* cultured surrounded by *avijjâ*, *tahnâ* and *upâdâna* are taken as being based  on *samudaya saccâ,* as explained with reference to *patisambhidâ magga pâli* - *atîte hetavopañca* etc.- and in accordance with these opening of the doctrines - this *samudaya*  *saccâ* is also a fact cultivated during the former life. 

For the purpose of logical reasoning, a further explanation will be made.  As it is clear that because of the *samudaya saccâ* as the cause, *dukkha saccâ* has  resulted.  In these cause and result phenomena, consideration should be made as to which comes first, the cause or the result.  If a meditator accepts the fact that the *samudaya saccâ* as the cause occurs at a moment different from that of the* resultant *dukkha saccâ*, i.e. each has its own moment of formation.  The difference in their formative moments by virtue of *ñân*. *âkkhanikakamma*, the cause *samudaya saccâ* which can give rise to *dukkha saccâ* as the  resultant  are  evident.   If  this  assumption  is  accepted,  i.e.  because  of  the  cause *samudaya saccâ*, the resultant *dukkha saccâ* has arisen for it is due to the cause that the result has occurred, then one of the doors on the path to *nibbâna* would have opened for  the meditator.  

In considering the five past phenomena, keep *kamma* as the prime factor which can be raised by virtue of *ñâ*.*n* *âkkhanika kamma*.  Because that *kamma* is of *ñâ*.*n* *âkkha- nika kamma* kind, if the fact that *samudaya saccâ* is first formed in of wake which the *dukkha saccâ* appears as the resultant is accepted, then consider once again which is  formed first, the *samudaya saccâ* or *dukkha saccâ*. 

Talking of a man on his present life, at the  moment of commencement from a female gamete inside his mother,  the three corporeality *kalâpas*, such as *kâyadassaka* *kalâpa*, *bhâvadassaka kalâpa*, *hadyadassaka kalâpa*, and 30 classes of corporeality, and if being a *tihita* individual, then there will be 34 species mind and mental properties.  

` `These 34 *nâma* (mental) properties are as follows. 

1. Conscious mind = *viññâña* = 1 *somanssahagutta ñâ*.*n* *asampayutta mahâvipâta citta*, 
1. Thirteen of *cetasikka* (Mind and metal properties) known as *aññasamâna* (both bad 

good ways),*   

3. Nineteen of *sobhanadhârana cetasikka* connected with all the *sobhancitta*, 
3. One *Paññañdare cetasikka*. 

Making up 34 in all. 

Included in this 34 are 

1. *Vedanâ* (suffering) is the *vedanakkhandhâ* (aggregate of sensation/suffering) 
1. *Saññâ* (perception) is the *saññâkkhandhâ* (aggregate of perception) 
1. The remaining 31 are the *sankhârakkhandha* (aggregate of  mental formation) 
1. Consciousness = *viñâna* is the *viñânakkhandhâ* (aggregate of consciousness).  

The 30 kinds of *rûpa* (corporeality) are the *rûpakkhandhâ* (aggregate of matter) and 34 kinds of *nâma* are four kinds *nâmakhandhâ* (aggregate of mind), coming to a total of five *khandhâ* (five aggregate of matter).  They are the *upâdânakkhandhâ* (the five aggregate as .o bject of clinging).  These five aggreates are *sankhittena pañcupâdânak*- *khandhâ* (*Sam*.-3: 369).  In accordance with the expression in Dhammacakkyâ desanâ they are the groups of *dukkha saccâ dhammas* (truth of suffering).  For a human being (a  worldling), therefore,  it is the *dukkha saccâ* which has to come first in the present life. 

If that *dukkha saccâ* is the result of *samudaya saccâ*, as indicated in the *desanâ*, the cause-resultant relationship pehnomenon, in which *samudaya saccâ* comes first and *dukkha saccâ* later if considered from point of view of *nâ*.*n* *âkkhanika kamma*. If this can be accepted, then *samudaya saccâ*, the cause of *dukkha saccâ*, then that *samudaya saccâ* does not belong to the present existence but that which has been cultured in one of the  previous life. And a meditator can easily accepted this explantion. 

`          `If the *samudaya saccâ*, surrounded by *avijjâ*, *tahnâ*, *upâdâna*, were cultured during  the past life, the question is which past life.  The answer is that it might be one of the two: 

1. *Upapajjavedanîya kamma,* 
1. *Aparapariyavedanîya kamma*. 

Suppose the *kamma* is *upapajjavedanîya kamma*, then it was the *kamma* which was  cultivated during the first past life.  If it is the *aparapariyavedanîya kamma*, then it was the *kamma* cultivated during the second or third past or one earlier than these two.   Be it the *upapajjavedanîya kamma* or *aparapariyavedanîya kamma*, a meditator should concentrate, by *samâditthi ñân*. *a* called *paccekkha ñâ*.*n* *a*, on that *kamma* named *samudaya saccâ*,  or  due  to  that  *kamma*  named  *samudaya  saccâ*,  there  appear  in  this  present existence the *pa*.*t* *issandhe* (rebirth) and the five *upâdânakkhandhâ* (the five aggregate of clinging to existence) etc. as the resultant *dukkha saccâ* (the truth of suffering).  Only by knowing and seeing this way can *ariya magga* (Noble Path), where all the factors of *âsava* (fetters) have completely been abolished, be attained as the Buddha has expatiated  in Upanissa Suttan. 

If that *kamma* named *samudaya saccâ* were *aparapariyavedanîya* kind of *kamma*, then concentration by *paccekkha ñâ*.*n* *a* should be made in such a way as to penetratively know the fact that this *kamma* was cultivated during the second past life etc.  Cultivation  of this past *kamma* would have to made via *samâditthi ñâna* r.e ferred to as *paccekkha* 

*ñân*. *a*.  Contemplation on this is explained in more details in section on Ahâra Suttan of  Pat.i cca samuppâda in Nibbânagâminipatipadâ Vol. 3).  

If you cannot agree, because of your own belief called *âdânaggâhî*, with the fact that the *kamma* which has been practised and cultured at a certain life in the past resulted  in the five *patissandhe khandhâ* (five-fold aggregate of rebirth) of the present life.  Then  the followings will also have to considered again as to whether or not they are required. 

1. For  *Sammâsambodhi Bodhisatta*s four *asankkheyya* and 100 thousands of worlds 
1. For *Paccekabuddha* *Bodhisatta*s* two *asankkheyya* and 100 thousands of worlds 
1. For *Aggasâvaka Bodhisatta*s,   one *asankkeyya* and 100 of thousands of worlds 
1. For  *Mahâsâvaka Bodhisatta*s, a hundred of thousands of worlds 

For those respective period of time each has spent in practising and cultivating in *dhammas* of perfection named *abhinihâra* (resolve to become a buddha) by a way leading to *bodhi ñâna* (knowledge of enlightenment) in the hope of acquiring it.  The reason is the rejcetion of the fact that because of *kamma*, called *samudaya saccâ*, of the previous existence  the  present  *dukkha  saccâ*,  called  five  *upâdânâkkhandhâ*  (the  five-fold aggregate  of  clinging  for  existence)  have  resulted.   This  rejection  is  as  good  as  not accepting *kamma* and its resultant formation.  The failure of accepting this *kamma*-result correlation is doomed to have committed a dangerous  great blunder of *ditthi* (wrong view)  called  *ahetikaditthi* (an  opinion  without  a  moral  condition), *akiriyaditthi*(  non- performing opinion) and *natthikaditthi* (a sceptic opinion).   It is similar to going down  *niyataditthi* (destiny of wrong view), the drain of great depth self-confidently. 

It is true that *tahnâ* is the *samudaya saccâ*.  The present *tahnâ*, the *samudaya saccâ*, however, is not the cause of the present five *pa*.*t* *issandhekhandhâ* (the five aggre- gate of rebirth). 

If the assertion that the present *dukkha saccâ* is the result of the cause *samudaya* *saccâ* is accepted then, as indicated in the above doctrines, you can try to wish for a life in heavenly sovareignty by performing a good deed.  If it is true that the cause of present *dukkha saccâ* is the present *samudaya saccâ*, then your wish will be fulfilled instantly. But it was not so.  In a similar way, you carry out a meritorious deed and wish for being free from becoming aged, from suffering, death and decay.  If the appearance of *dukkha saccâ* as a result of the *samudaya saccâ*, both of the present, were indeed the truth, your wish for not becoming aged, no suffering, no death and decay would be fulfilled in no time.  But it has never happened.  Similarly, a sixty-year old may wish for rejuvinating into a very good looking 16-year old by performing meritorious deeds.  If the cause-result relation of the present *samudaya saccâ* and the present *dukkha saccâ* were, in fact, true then a very handsome 16-year old would have appeared immdeiately.  But however much you made wishes by peforming good deeds, you never become a handsome 16-year old. You will still be aged, haggard, never going back to your youth and remain old.  As a matter of fact, if the present *dukkha saccâ* were truely the result of the present *samudaya saccâ*  by conducting meritorious works and the wishes fulfilled, then there will no more  be the aged and ugly, those who are suffering, and those who are short-lived. 

What the above descriptions, with examples, really mean is this.  If a meditator is 

aware of just the present *samudaya saccâ* and the present *dukkha saccâ*, then he is not able to know the nature of formation of  the *dukkha saccâ* as the resultant of the cause *samudaya saccâ*.  It is because clearly it is due to the *samudaya saccâ* cultivated during the past existence that the present *dukkha saccâ* has resulted, and that which is cultivated during this life cause the *dukkha saccâ*, such as the five *patisandhekhandhâ* etc., of the coming existence will be formed as a result.  It has been mentioned in Upanissa Suttan  and Ãsavekkhaya Suttan, as expounded by the Buddha that without the penetrative  knowledge, acquired via *paccekkha ñâna*, in oneself of the truth of *dukkha saccâ*  

` `appearing as a result of *samudaya* *saccâ*, *ariya magga ñâna* (knowledge of noble path)  cannot be attained.  .  . 

If a meditator does not meditate, by *paccekkha ñâ*.*n* *a*, on the past then he can in no way know, by means of *paccekkha ñâ*.*n* *a*, the *sankhâra kamma* called *samudaya saccâ* surrounded by *avijjâ*, *tahnâ*, *upâdâna* cultivated at a certain previous existence.  Why?  Because he did not.  If the *samudaya saccâ* cultivated during certain previous life is not penetratively seen by means of *paccekkha ñân*. *a*, then the meditator cannot know, by *paccekkha ñân*. *a*,  the appearance of the present *dukkha saccâ* as a result of the past *samudaya saccâ*.  The Buddha has expatiated that if the formation of the present *dukkha saccâ*, such as the five-fold aggregate of rebirth etc., caused by the past *samudaya saccâ* cannot be penetratively seen by *paccekkha ñâna*, then *âsava*-free *ariya magga* cannot be acquired.  In the same way, if a meditator does not meditate, by *paccekkha ñâ*.*n* *a*, on the future, then he can in no way know, by means of *paccekkha ñâ*.*n* *a*, the *sankhâra kamma* called  *samudaya  saccâ*  surrounded  by  *avijjâ*,  *tahnâ*,  *upâdâna*  cultivated  during  the present existence.  Why?  Because he did not.  The Buddha did not expatiate that if the formation of the future *dukkha saccâ*, such as the five-fold aggregate of rebirth etc., caused by the present *samudaya saccâ* cannot be penetratively seen by *paccekkha ñâ*.*n* *a*,  then *âsava*-free *ariya magga* can be acquired. 

Similarly, if a meditator does not concentrate on the future, then he cannot see the future *dukkha saccâ* penetratively, via *paccekkha ñâ*.*n* *a* (pactical knowledge) called the *sammâditthi ñâna* (the right understanding), as the result of the present *samudaya saccâ*. Why?  Because he did not concentrate on the future.  The Buddha did not teach that without knowing penetratively by *paccekkha ñâ*.*n* *a* called *sammâditthi ñâna* the formation of future *dukkha saccâ* because of the present *samudaya saccâ*, one can attain the *ariya  magga* where *âsava*s have been abolished. 

Therefore, to know penetratively by *paccekkha ñâ*.*n* *a* the appearance of the future *dukkha saccâ* as a result of the present *samudaya saccâ*, a meditator has to start by  cultivating on the past and future corporeality by the *paccekkha ñâ*.*n* *a*.   

The *samudaya saccâ* cultivated during the past existence are just the parts of aggregate of the past.  The present *dukkha saccâ* derived from the past *samudaya saccâ* are also just the part and parcel of the present aggregate.  What has been cultivated as *samudaya saccâ*  in the present existence  and  which would become the future  *dukkha*  *saccâ* are the parts of future aggregate. 

A further explanation will make these statements become clearer.  Among the 

past phenomena or of the *samudaya saccâ* cultured in the past *avijjâ*, *tahnâ*, *upâdâna* etc. are *kilesa vatta* (functions of lust), *sankhâra-kamma* are the *kamma vatta* (functions of one's action).  The five *patisandhe* etc. (the five aggregate of rebirth) of human being which is the *kusalavipâka v*.*a* *tta* phenomenon (result of the function of good deed) and the *sankhâra kamma* which can give rise to *kammaja rûpa* (material quality born of *kamma*)  are just the *kusala sankhâra kamma*. 

Here *avijjâ*, *tahnâ*, *upâdâna* etc. are not the factors which can give rise solely to the *avijjâ*, to *tahnâ* and to *upâdâna*.   They are formed accompanied by the relative *cetasikka* (mind and metal properties).  For the *putthujana* (worldling) generally they occur naturally as mind-derived greediness.  If it is the *lobhamû* (the root of greed), the *somanassasahagutta* (formed with feeling of joy), *ditthikatasampayuta* (associated with recently seen) *sankhârika citta* (mind associated with *sankhâra*), then in each of these *akusala citta* (mind associated with bad deed) there will be 20 mental factors of mind and  mental properties.  These are as follows. 

*Somanassasahagutta dithigatasampayutta lobhamû asankhârika citta* –   1 

*Aññasamânacetacikka*      – 13 

*Moha ahirika anuttappa uddhicca* called *akusalasâdhâranacetacika*    –   4 

*Lobha + ditthi*        –   2             Total  ![](Aspose.Words.91ef50e2-8a22-40ad-9554-63f4a76c4039.001.png)         20 

In  each  of  the  respective  *jocittakkhana*  will  be  20  mind  and  mental  factors.  Because of the presence of factors which have the potential of giving rise to *patissandhe* as a result (rebirth as a resultant), they are the *manodvârikahovîthi* (mental phenomena of mind-door processes) mental phenomena.  In this *citta* (mind) + *cetacikka* (mind and 

` `mental properties) = mental factors – 

1. *Vedanâ* is the *vedanakkhandhâ*, 
1. *Saññâ* is the *saññakkhandhâ*, 
3. Remaining (17) *cetacikka* are *samkhâkkhandhâ*, 
3. (*Lobhamû*) *Viññâna* *ñân*. *a* is the consciousness of *viññânakkhandhâ*, 

summing up to a total of four *nâma khandhâ* (mental factors) 

5. The  54  kinds  of  the  material  factors  nominated as *sasambhârahadaya*  together  with  the  *hadaya  vatthu*,  which  form  the  base  of  these  mental  factors,  are  *rûpakkhandhâ* – totaling as the five *khandhâ* (the five aggregate).  (see meditation 

`     `*Rûpakammathâna* for number these 54 kinds). 

These past four mental aggregate which are called the *kilesavatta* (functions of the *kilesâ*)  are  parts  of  the  past  aggregate  resulting  from  the   five  *upâdânak-khandhâ* correspondingly, called the *vipâkavatta* (function of the effects of one’s action).  These  existed in the past as the five *bhavañkhandhâ* etc., called the *manodvâra*. 

Again, the *sankhâra*-*kamma*, if confined to the worldling, the basic cause of the five aggregate which existed as *tihittasomanassa patisan*. *dhe* of a good man, has existed as the *tihittasomanassa pa*.*t* *isandhe* in the past.  And his present *sankhâ-kamma* 

are the result of those cultivated in the past.  These *kamma* may either be *upapajjanîya*  

*kamma* or *aparâpariyavedanîya kamma*. 

*Cetanâham*.  *bhikkave kammam*.  *vad*.*â* *mi, cetayitvâ kammam*.  *karoti kâyena vâcâya  manassâ* (*Am*-2-363; *Abhi*.- 4: 290). 

In such *desanâ* (doctrines), the Buddha has expounded *cetanâ* (volition)  as the the prime factor for *kamma*.   Therefore, in accordance with *sankhâra*-*kamma*, *cetanâ*  should primarily be taken as the prime factor. 

*Cetanâsampayuttadhammânam*.  *pana kammabhâvo kammacatukkena dîpito* (*Abhi.- Tha.*- 1: 131). 

In  accordance  with  the  opening  of  Athâsâlinî  athakathâ,  *cetanâ*,  which  is  the *cetanâsampayutta dhamma*, and the corresponding *citta cetasikka sam*. *payutta* factors 

` `are also indicated in the Añguttora catukkanipâta Bujjañga Suttan (*Am*.-1:559) by the  Buddha to be the *kamma*.  (see that Suttan for detail). 

For that reason, *cetanâ* and its corresponding *cetanâsampayutta dhamma* are to be taken with reference to *sankhâra*-*kamma*.  The *sankhâra*-*kamma*, which are the basic causes of the five aggregate of the *tihittasomanassa pat*.*i* *sandhe* of a good man existing  as  *tihittasomanassa  pa*.*t* *isandhe*,  are  also  the  *somanassasahagutta  ñân*. *asampayutta mahâkusala cetanâ* and the *cetanâsampayutta dhamma*.  There are 34 categories of  *kusala cetanâ* and *citta cetacikka*.  They are as follows. 

. 

*Somanassasahagutta ñân*. *asampayutta kusala citta*   -      1  

*Añasamâna cetacikka*   -    13 *Sobhanasâdhârana cetacikka*   -    19 

*Paññañdare cetacikka*   -      1 

Total        34 In these 34 mental factors  ![](Aspose.Words.91ef50e2-8a22-40ad-9554-63f4a76c4039.002.png)

1. *Vedanâ* is the *vadanakkhandhâ*, 
2. *Saññâ* is the *saññakkhandhâ*, 
2. The remaining 31 are the *sañkhârakkhandhâ*, 
2. *Somanassasahagutta ñânasampayutta mahâkusala citta* is *viññânakkhandhâ*, 
2. Material bases of these mental factors are *rûpakkhandhâ*, 

When added together they come to be the five *khandhâ* (the five aggregate). 

These  *sankhâra*-*kamma*   are  the  factors  which  have  the  force  to  produce   the  five *paccuppana patisandhe* etc., which are *vipakavatta dhamma*, and for which they are just the *manodvârika jovîthi* (mind-door based process of apperceiving) mental processes. 

` `Each *jocittakkhana* has 34 mental factors. 

*Kâmâvacara kusalassa kammassa katattâ upacitattâ* (*Abhi*.-1: 104). 

According to these *desanâ*, the *manodvârika jovîthi* too have occurred not only once but many times.  They are the groups of *kammavatta dhamma*.  These *kammavatta* *dhammas* also are parts of the past aggregate which had appeared based on the five *bhavañkhandhâ* etc. of *upâdânakkhandhâ* called *vipâkavatta* during the past life. 

The *kilesavatta*, *kammavatta* and *vipâkavatta* mentioned above, which are the the past five aggregate, and a practicing meditator must already have cultured these in the first place.  He must have analytically concentrated these via *paccakkha ñâ*.*n* *a*.  Further he must  already  have  analytically  cultured,  by  means  of  *paccakkha  ñâ*.*n* *a*,  all  these  five *patisandhekahndhâ* etc. of the *vipâkavatta dhammas* which had appeared due to the  *kilesa vatta* and *kammavatta* factors. 

Only after having cultured these by this kind analytical knowledge can onebe able to analytically culture, as a step further, the fact that the past *kammavatta* appeared due to the past *kilesavatta*, and because of these past *kammavatta* that the present five *pa*.*t* *isan- dhe* aggregate are formed. 

If, however, the basic causes of the present *vipâkavatta* which are the past *kilesa*- *vattakhandhâ*, the past *kammavatta khandhâ*, and their bases the past *vipâkavattakhandhâ* are not cultivated at all, not concentrated at all, and not seen penetratively by *paccakkha ñâ*.*n* *a* at all, the meditator would have accumulated a multitude of unknown factors.  Then this meditator will not have acquired the penetrative knowledge of the fact that the past *kamma vatta* was caused by the past *kilesavatta* and the present *vipâkavatta* caused by the  past *kamma* *vatta*.  Because of the *samudaya saccâ* cultivated in past the present five aggregate etc. of *patisandhe*,  called *vipâka vatta dukkha saccâ*, are distinctly formed,  and if these are not k.n own penetratively by *paccakkha ñana*, then the *ariya magga* where the all *âsava* factors have been annihilated will not be atta.i ned, as expounded by the  Buddha. 

Again,  there  are  *kilesa  vatta*  and  *kamma  vatta*  called  *avijjâ*,  *tahnâ*,  *upâdâna*, *sankhâra* and *kamma* being cultivate presently.  These *kilesa vatta* and *kamma vatta* are the  cause  for  the  future  *vipâka  vatta*  factors.   If  you,  as  a  meditator,  cultivate  the *kâmâvâcara, mahâ kusala*, *sankhâra*-*kamma* in anticipation of becoming a monk in the  future life, then you have commited the following errors. 

1. The nature of wrong consciousness as a monk is an ignorance, 
1. The clinging to a monk’s life is the *tahnâ*, 
3. Mentally attached to the monk’s life is an *upâdâna*, 

And these are the three *kilesa vatta*.  Suppose you are still existing at the stage of *rihitputhujana*.  Then these factors of *kilesa vatta* are groups of *lobhadithi* in general. If you have happily made a wish, then there will 20 species of  mind and mental properties as the wish was conditioned by *somanassa vedanâ*.  They are the the four *nâma khandhâ* (mental aggregate).  Their material bases are the *rûpakkhandhâ*.   When  added together they come to be the five aggregate. 

Again, the *sankhâra kamma* called the *kamma vatta*, if they are of *somanassaha* *gutta*, *nana sampayutta*, *tihitta kâmâvacara kusala* kind, then there will be 34 species of mind and mental properties.  They are the four *nâma khandhâs*. Their material bases  are the *rûpakkhandhâ*.   When added together they amount to be the five aggregate. 

As mentioned in Patisambhidhâ Pâli *Edha paripakkattâ âyatanânam* (.*P*.  *atisa*. *m*.: .5 0), 

according to which these *kilesa vatta* and *kamma vatta* are the groups of *dhamma* can arise when the *indriye* (control principle) has matured.  These *kilesa vatta*, *kamma* *vatta*, and *jhocitta* which have the potential to give rise to the (future birth), are the  groups of *nâma dhamma* which lie within the process of *manodvârika jovîthi*. 

Let us say a noble meditator is a 60-year old.  Suppose also that he had wished for the life of a monk by performing good deeds throughout his life time.  If so, then the *kilesa vatta* and *kamma vatta* have taken place before attaining the age of 60, and if he continues such a wish even after arriving at 60 years of age, these *dhammas* can still occur.  These *dhammas* can appear only if  they are based on the *vipâka vatta*, which  are the five *bhavañkhandhâ* etc., called *manodvâra*. 

As these *kilesa vatta* and *kamma vatta* are the causes of future *vipâka vatta*, this *kamma* can an *âcinna kamma* (practiced *kamma*).  It may also be *âsanna kamma* (near cause).  Suppose you are a *chânalâbhî* (intelligent) individual longing for the life of a bhyammâ in stead of wishing for a monk’s life, and the jhâna you have attained still lingers on to the time of death, then the cause of future *bhyammâ*’s life or *bhyammâ*’s  *khandhâ* may be *garuka kamma* (bent on *kamma*). 

If it is the *âcinna kamma*, then this *âcinna kamma* might have been one that was practiced before attaining the age of 60.  Or it may be the *âcinna kamma* that is going to be cultured after 60 and prior to death.  The knowledge which can analytically  appreciate and culture *nâma* (mind) and *rûpa* (matter), called *nâmarûpa pariccheda* (analytical knowledge of mind and matter),  the nature of relationship of the present resultant and the past cause, and of the future result and the present cause etc. which can be cultured by virtue of *paccayapariggaha nân*.*a* , and the *vipassanâ ñâna*.  (insight  knowledge) by means of which the five *upâdânakkhandhâ* can be concentrated as the characteristic object, and the *cetanâ* (volition) conditioned by these knowledge are said to be the *vipassanâ cetanâ*.  This *vipassanâ cetanâ* called the *vipassanâ kamma* can  also be *âcinna kamma*. 

*Ettha* "*no ce bhikkhave ceteti no ca pakappeti*, *atha kho anussetî"ti evum*.  *bhagavatâ dutiyanaye pubbabhâge bhavanibbattaka kusalâkusalâyûhanam*. , *pakappanañca vinâpi*

*hoti* (*Sam*.-*Tî*.-2: 83). 

In accordance with the Samyuttatîkâ opening with reference to Cetanâ Suttan, the *vipassanâcetanâ* = the *vipassanâ kamma* also have the potential to form *pa*.*t* *isandhe*  (rebirth). 

***Ãyatim patisamdhiyâ paccayo hotî**ti sankhârûpakkhâsampayuttakammassa balvattâ teneva sugatipatisadhiyâ dîyamânâya abhinandanasañkhâto lobhakile*.*s* *o anâga*.*t* *e kâmâ*.*v* *acarasugatipatisandhiyâ paccayo hoti*.  *Yassamâ kilesasahâyam kammam*

*rûpa ñân*. *a* of the *puthujana* (worldling) is indicated by Patisambhidhâ Pâli (*Pati*.*s* *am*.-  60) to be cause of the future *pa*.*t* *isandhe* (rebirth).  What it means of is this.  If the *vipassanâ  kamma*,  conditioned  by  *sankhârupakkhâ  ñâ*.*n* *a*,  is  powerful,  and  if  this *vipassanâ  kamma*  itself  causes  the  *sugatipatisandhe*  as  a  result,  then  *abhinandha dhamma* called *lobha kilesâ*, and which has the affinity for *sankârupakkhâ ñâ*.*n* *a*, will in future be the cause of the *kâmâvacara sugati pa*.*t* *isandhe*.  The *vipassanâ kamma*, in combination with *lobha kilesâ*, will directly result in *vipâka* resultant.  Therefore, the *vipassanâ kamma* is the *janaka* cause giving rise to direct a result.  *U*.*p* *atthambhaka*  *dhamma*, supported by *kilesâ kamma*, is the causative factor (*Pa*.*t* *isam*.-*Tha*.-2: 250).  

Therefore the *âcinna kamma*, which is about to give a result, is the kind of *kamma* that frequently occurs in a time span from maturation of *indare*s to the time prior to death.  Since it is this kind of *kamma*, it is a *dhamma* called *addhâpaccuppana* among  the three classes of present. 

If this *âcinna kamma* is indeed going to give a result in future, then the meditator must first concentrate on this *kamma* by *samâditthi ñâ*.*n* *a* called *paccakkha ñâ*.*n* *a*.  It should  be  noted  that  this is  the kind of  *kamma*  that  will go on appearing any time  throughout the duration of life. 

Again if the *âsanna kamma*, which is cultured just before death, has the chance to truely produce future *pa*.*t* *isandhe* etc. which is the *vipâka vatta* as a resultant, then endeavour is made to penetratively see this *kamma* by means of *samâditthi ñâ*.*n* *a* called *paccakkha ñân*. *a*.  It must, however, be noted that, since *âsanna kamma* is cultured  just prior to death, it unlike the *kamma* presently cultivating on the cause and result pre- vailing at the present period. 

Again if the meditator is *chânalâbhî* individual and if the *mahagutakusala*, called the *garuka kamma*, is definitely about to give a result, then this *kamma* must be cultured 

` `and seen penetratively by *samâditthi ñân*. *a* called *paccakkha ñâ*.*n* *a*.  

After this *kamma* has been cultured, *vipâka vatta*, which are the the future five 

*pa*.*t* *isandhekhandhâ* etc. are cultured and seen penetratively via *samâditthi ñân*. *a* called the  *paccakkha ñân*. *a*.  Only after cultivating this way, the following has to be cultured. 

Due to *sankhâra kamma*, surrounded by *avijjâ*, *tahnâ*, *upâdana*, referred to as the *samudaya saccâ*, acquired during the present, the nature of the appearance of groups of 

. 

- . 

*dukkha saccâ* which are the future five *patisandhekhandhâ* called *vipâka vatta dhammas* are visualized penetratively and cultured by *samâditthi ñâna* called the *paccakkha ñâna*.  (For detail on the way of culturing see section on Paticcasamuppâda). 

If the meditator is still not satisfied with the statement that the appearance of the future *dukkha saccâ* due to the cause of the present *samudaya saccâ* can be cultured by  *paccakkha ñâ*.*n* *a*, then go through the opening of the doctrines given below. 

*Ñâ*.*n* *asamañgî puggalo cakkhum*.*â*  *viya cakkhunâ rûpâni, ñân*. *ena vivatte dhamme passati*  (*Sam*.-*Tha*.-2:49; *Upanisasuttan*).

*Dassanappabhâvum hi upâdâya ñân*. *a samañgî puggalo cakkhumâ viya puggalo cakkhunâ rûpâni*, *ñân*. *ena vivatte dhamme passati* (*Itivuttaka*.-*Tha*.: 310; *Ãsavekkhaya* 

` `*Suttan*). 

***Janato**ti vâ vatvâ na jânanam*.  *anussavâkârapaviritakkamattavasena idhâdhippetam*. , *atha kho rûpâni viya cakkhuññân*. *ena rûpâdîni tesam*.  *c*. *a samudayâdike pa*.*c* *cakhe katvâ*  

*dassananti vibhâvetun "**passato"**ti vuttanti evum vâ ettha attho* (*Sam*.-*Tî*.-2: 63). 

As a man could see a variety of material bodies with his physical eyes, so would a meditator, endowed with *vipassanâñâna*, see the *paramatthasabhâva* object in its very true nature by virtue of knowledge acquired through *vipassanâ* he is exercising.  Through the light shone by the knowledge acquired while exercising on *vipassanâ*, he would see  the following. 

1. The five *upâdânakkhandhâ* such as *rûpa*-*vedanâ*-*saññâ*-*sankhâra*-*viññana*, 
1. The distinctness of the causes such as *avijjâ*, *tahnâ*, *upâdâna*, *sankhâra*, *kamma* etc.  
   1. because of these distinct causes the nature of samudaya (arising) of distinct result  such as the five *upâdânakkhandhâ*; the nature of the formation these *upâdânak- khandhâ* distinctly as *upâda* which is the *nibbatti* character, 
1. Cessation,  at  the  time  of  *arahatta  magga*,  of  the  causes  such  as  *avijjâ*,  *tahnâ*, *upâdâna*, *sankhâra*, *kamma* etc. by means of *anuppâdanirodha* (non-reappearable cessation) = because of cessaton via non-returnable means, the cessation of the resultant  five  *upâdânakkhandhâ*  by  *parinibbânacuti*  (released  from  death  and rebirth), and the nature of this release, perishing away of these five *upâdânakkhan- dhâ* called *viparinâmalakkhanâ* (character of *dhamma* subject to change) which is  of the nature of *nirodha* (= said to be *uppânirodha*). 

This means to say that the above can be seen by means of *vipassanâ samâditthi* (*vipassanâ* insight).  This knowledge is not a speculation based on what has been told by predecessors, called *anussava* knowledge = not the kind of knowledge handed down from the previous ones.  It is not a knowledge acquired by speculation based on the appearance and speculation such as "this might be it" = not the kind of knowledge acquired by *âkâra*-  *parivitakka* (careful consideration) (= *uppâdanirodha*,  a sudden, unusal event of cessa- tion)  (*Sam*.-*Tha*.-2: 49).  

Again, within the three moments of the past, future and present lie the five *upâdâ*- *nakkhandhâ* designated as cause *khandhâ* and resultant *khandhâ* also are the objects on the characters of which the concentration has to be made by means of the *vipassanâ* *samâditthi ñâna* called *paccakkha ñâna*. (This does not mean all the past factors all along the circle of past existance, nor all the future factors of the circle of future life). 

In this contemplation will be included the following. 

`           `The five *kilesa vatta khandhâ* and the five *kamma vatta khnadhâ* reckoned as the past fives causes, the five *bhavañ khandhâ* etc. of the past five *khandhâ*, which are  the base of the *kilesa vatta* and *kamma vatta*. 

Because of the past five causes the present five *patisandhe* *khandhâ*, the five *bhavañ khandhâ* etc., which are the present five *upâdânakkhandhâ*, have appeared clearly, and based on these have appeared the five *kilesa vatta khandhâ* and the five *kam- ma vatta khandhâ* have appeared. 

Because of these present causes such as *kilesa vatta* and *kamma vatta* would in future appear the resultants like the future five *patisandhe khandhâ* etc. of the future five  *upâdânakkhandhâ*. 

If you are still not contented with the above statements, the peruse the following  sermons given in the doctrines. 

*Yam kañci Râhula rûpam atîtânâgata paccuppanam*. R.  *Sabbam rûpam* "*netam ma ma*, *nesohamassami, na meso attâ*"*ti eva metam yathâbhûtam sammappapaññâya passati*  (*Sam*.-1: 444).*

The Buddha has instructed Râhula and the five *vaggiya* to concetrate on the five *upâdânakkhandhâ*, which  existed  as the  past,  future  and  present  etc.  of  11  kinds,  as *anicca* (impermanece), *dukkha* (suffering) and *anatta* (non-self), and to contemplate on their true nature by means of *vipassanâ paññâ* and *magga* *paññâ*, called *sammappaññâ* (true wisdom).  Here the indication is restricted to concentration by *vipassanâ ñâna*.  The essence of these book of doctrines are as given below. 

***Sammappaññâya passati***  In vipassanâ, which is prior to ariya magga, the past, future and and present *upâdânakkhandhâ* are taken as object of concentration, by virtue of which the impermanence, suffering and non-self of these upâdânakkhandhâ are truely acquired*** by *vipassanâ sammâditthi*, calle *attapaccakkha ñâna* (*Sam*.-*Tha*.2: 197; *Sam*.- *Tî*.-2: 181). 

This is the end of explanation on the *samudaya sacca*.  If you are still unsatisfied,  then go through the following passages extracted from *desanâ*. 

**Extracts from Mahânîdâna Suttan** 

*Gambhîro câyam ânanda paticcasamuppâdo gambhîrâvabhâso ca*.  *Etassa cânanda dhammassa ananubodhâ appativedhâ evamayam pajâ tantâkusalajâtâ kulagantthikajâtâ muñjapabbajabhûtâ apâyam duggatim vinipâtam sansâram nâtivattati* (*Dî.-*2: 47; *Sam*.- 1: 318). 

***Ananubodhâ**ti ñâtapariññâvasena anubujjhanâ*. ***Appativedhâ**ti tîranappahânapariññâvasena appativijjhanâ*. (*Dî.*-*Tha*.-* 2: 88). 

*Ãnandhâ* .... The logic of this *paticcasamuppâda* (causal relationship) deep.  And because of its depth it appears apprently deep to one's mind.  *Ãnandâ* .... this causal rela- tionship should be appreciated by *ñâtapariññâ* (intelligently known) called *anubhoda*- *ñâna* (perceptual knowledge).  If not appreciated accordingly then no one will know the attainment of the *magga* (Path) and *phala* (Fruit) by way of *tîranapariññâ* and *pahâna*- *pariññâ*,  called  the  *pativedha  ñâna*  (penetrative  knowledge).   Because  of  such  an ignorance the living beings are entangled in worldly affairs not unlike *muja*  and *pabbaja* grasses  (these  grass  are  used  as  feet  wiper,  which  after  being  used  for  a  long  time, become torn and worn out so that neither beginning nor end would be made out).  It is similar to a nest of female weaver bird.  They will be struggling in a tangle of worldly affairs  in  the  rounds  of rebirth.   They would  not  able  to  escape  from  the  rounds  of *apâyaduggati* (an unhappy existence) to which they fallen in disarray and without any hope or expectation and the rounds of *sugati* (a happy existence) besides *apâya* (*Dî*.-2:  47; *Sam*.-1: 318). 

With reference to the above Mahânidâna Suttan, the Commentaries have made the  following recommendations. 

*Iduñhi gambhîrato agâdham, nânâyaggahanato dûrabiyânam, ñânâsinâ  samâdhipavarasilâyam sunisitena* —  

*Bhavacakkhamapadâletvâ, asanivicakkamiva aniccanimmathanam*. *Samsârabhayamatîto*, *nakoci supinantarepayatti* (*Abhi*.-*Tha*.-2: 189; *Visuddhi*-2: 221). 

This logic of *paticca samuppâda* (causal relationship) is deep, and because being deep, there can be no support.  Particular methods of this relationship are complex like an inaccessible thicket of bushes, and difficult to escape from it.  Without breaking through these factors of causal relationship, which have the property of torturing the worldling, by virtue of *samâditthi*, no one has escaped even in the dream from these catastrophic  phenomena (*Abhi*.-*Tha*.-2: 189; *Visuddhi*-2: 221). 

A meditator who is truely longing for *nibbâna* must make effort to analytically and penetratively undestands the nature of causal relationship by means of *ñâtapariñña*  called *anubhodha ñâna*, *tîranapariññâna*  called *pativedha ñâna* and *pahânapariññâ*, all  referred to as the three *pariññâna*. 

*Anubhodhâ appativedhâ* = failure again and again to know by *anubodha ñâna*, failure to know the attainment of fruit of the Path penetratively is doomed to encounter the  state  of  being  lost  and  the  rounds  of  rebirth  which  one  cannot  overcome.   The Buddha,  being  sympathetic  and  merciful  towards  the  living  beings,  has  himself 

expatiated this by his knowledge of *desanâ*.  Therefore, those who wants to be free from rounds of existence must make effort to know this factor analytically and penetratively by the three *pariññâ pañâ* called the *pativedha* understanding.  It is not be attempted to know by speculation called *anumâna* (knowledge by inference) understanding, nor is it  the knolwedge imparted by the teachers.  This will have to be well understood. 

Since the suffering from the rounds of rebirth can only be escaped if the logic of *paticca samuppâda* is understood analytically by the three *pariññâ*, these three *pariññâ* will be dealth with in continuation.  The *pariññâ* associated with the *paticca samuppâda* is  of  two  kinds:  *lokîpariññâ*  (*pariññâ*  of  mundane)  and  *lokuttarâpariññâ*  (*parññâ*  of supra-mundane).   The  *lokîpariññâ*  again  is  of  three  different  kinds:  *ñâtapariññâ*, *tîranapariññâ*   and  *pahânapariññâ*.   In  the  *lokuttarapariññâ*  also  are  *ñâtapariññâ*, *tîranapariññâ*  and *pahânapariññâ*.  Now these *pariññâ* will be described. 

**The Three Kinds of *Lokîpariññâ*** 

***Ñâtapariññâ***  —  If  *lakkhana*-*rasa*-*paccuppathâna*-*patathâna*  of  the  *paticca* *samuppâda*  characters  of  *avijjâ*,  *sankhâra*,  *viññâna*,  *nâma*-*rûpa*,  *salâyatana*,  *phassa*, *vedanâ*, *tahnâ*, *upâdâna*, *bhava*, *jâti*, *jarâmarana* etc. can be digested and concentrated, then that knowledge is *nâmarûpapaticcheda ñâna*.  (for the way to cultivate see section  on Lakkhanâdicatukka). 

Again if the formation of *sankhâra* due to *avijjâ*, of *viññâna* due to *sankhâra*, of *nâma*-*rûpa*  due  to  *viññâna*  etc.  of  the  nature  of  causal  relationship  can  be  seen penetratively via knowledge by one's self, then that knowledge is the *paccayapariggaha  ñâna* (knowledge of discerning cause and effect). 

These two *nâma-rûpapariccheda ñâna* (knowledge that discerns mentality and corporeality as two separate groups) and *paccayapariggaha ñâna*, the knowledge which can understand analytically the *sankhâra* states, and which should be understood, as the  object of *vipassanâ ñâna* are ***ñâtapariññâ***. 

*Tîranapariññâ* — The features of *paticca samupâda* such as *avijjâ*, *sankhâra*,  *viññâna*, *nâma-rûpa* etc. are 

1. to understand by knowledge the fact that formation is followed by destruction and it is inicca (the impermanence) 
1. to understand by knowledge the fact that the effects of formation and destruction are always torturing, a feature of *dukkha* (suffering) and it is the *dukkha*,  
1. to understand by knowledge the fact that in essence what has been formed is not an indestrictible material *atta* (self), but a feature of *anatta* (non-self), the sammasana ñâna and *udayabbaya ñâna* which can investigate and determine *anicca* as, *dukkha* as *dukkha*, and *anatta* as *anatta*, 
1. ***paccayato udayabbaya ñâna*** which can see the distict results, such as  of the *viññâna*, *nâma-rûpa*, *salâyatana*, *phassa*, *vedanâ*, etc. which form the aggregate of the *vipâka* *vatta*, due to distinct causes such as *avijjâ*, *tahnâ*, *upâdâna*, *sankhâra*, *kamma* etc.;  ***paccayato udayabbaya ñâna*** which visualize that fact that because of the causes such as *avijjâ*, *tahnâ*, *upâdâna*, *sankhâra*, *kamma* of the *arahatta magga* which have ceased by nature of *anuppâda nirodha*; ***paccayato vayadassana ñâna*** which is able to visualize the fact  that  because  of  such  a  kind  of  cessation,  the  *viññâna*,  *nâma-rûpa*,  *salâyatana*, *phassa*, *vedanâ*, etc. which form the aggregate of the *vipâka vatta* have come to cease completely by nature of *anuppâda nirodha*; ***khanato udayadassana ñâna*** which can  recognize the *nibbattilakkhanâ* which is the formation of salient features *paticca* *samupâda*; ***khanato vayadassana ñâna*** which can appreciate perishing of these features  of *paticca samupâda* by nature of *vaya* called *viparinâmalakkhanâ* 

[Note.  These  *paccayato udayadassana ñâna*, *paccayto vayadassana ñâna* are the *paccayto udayabbayadassana ñâna*.  The *khanato udayadassana ñâna*, *khanato  vayadassana ñâna* are the *khanato udayabbayadassana ñâna*]. 

These two *sammasana ñâna* and *udayabbaya ñâna* are termed ***tîranapariññâ***.  This is wisdom by virtue of which *anicca*, *dukkha* and *anatta*, the phenomena of *paticca samuppâda* are known by investigation, determination and analysis. 

**Instructions of the *Patisambhidâ Magga Pâli*** 

To meditate on the features of *paticca samupâda* by *udayabbayanupassanâ ñâ*.*n* *a*  the Patisambhidâ Magga Pâli has instructed as given below. 

- . 

*Jâtâ avijjâ paccupp*.*a* *nâ*, *tassâ nibbattilakkhanam udayo*, *viparimânalakkhan*. *am vayo*, *anupassanâ ñâ*.*n* *am*.  R.  *Jâto bh*. *avo paccuppanno*, *tassa* .*n* *ibbattilakkha*.*n* *am udayo*,  

*viparimânalakkhanam vayo*, *anupassanâ ñân*. *am* (*Pa*.*t* *isam*. *.*- 52). 

1. The *paramattha dhamma sabhâvalakkhan*. *â* (*dhamma* of the ultimate truth specific 

character)  in  the  making,  called  *paramattha*  *attabhâva*  (the  ultimate  truth  of individuality) still acquiring, *avijjâ* within the three moments of *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañ* is the *paccuppanna dhamma* (the present state).  The initial stage of the formation of *avijjâ* which  is  the  present,  the  *nibbattilakkhan*. *â*  is  the  formation  =  *udaya*.   *Viparinâma* *lakkhanâ* (features subject to change) is destruction = *vaya*.  The ability to repeatedly discern on the *udaya* and *vaya* is the *udayabbayanupassanâ ñân*. *a* (knowledge of  meditating on the arising and dissolution of the object). 

2. The *paramattha dhamma sabhâvalakkha*.*n* *â* (*dhamma* of the ultimate truth specific 

character)  in  the  making,  called  *paramattha*  *attabhâva*  (the  ultimate  truth  of individuality) still acquiring, *sankhâra* within the three moments of *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañ* is the *paccuppanna dhamma* (the present state).   The initial stage of the formation of *sankhâra* which  is  the  present,  the  *nibbattilakkhan*. *â*  is  the  formation  =  *udaya*.   *Viparinâma* *lakkhan*. *â* (features subject to change) is dissolution = *vaya*. The ability to repeatedly  concentrate on the *udaya* and *vaya* is the *udayabbayanupassanâ ñâ*.*n* *a*. 

[**Note**.  If these *avijja* and *sankhâra* are the causes of *Paccuppanna pa*.*t* *isandhe* and the five *khandhas* etc. of the *vipâkavatta*, then these two are the groups of the *dhammas* of the past according to the statement *avjjâ sankhârâ atîto addhâ*.  The *vipassanâ ñân*. *a* which  can  discern  them  during  their  *upâda*  (arising  stage)  and  during  their  *bhañga* (disappearing stage) has been expounded by the Buddha to be the *udayabbayânupassanâ* 

*ñân*. *a*.  These *dhammas* have existed during the past period as *upâda-thî-bhin*.  These  *dhammas*, while existing within the three general characters, are also called the *paccup*- *panna dhammas*.  Note also that the same applies to the *dhamma* of *Paticca samuppâda*  given below]. 

\4.  The *paramattha dhamma sabhâvalakkhanâ* (*dhamma* of the ultimate truth specific character) in the making, called *paramattha* *attabhâva* (the ultimate truth of  

individuality) still acquiring, *viññâna* within the three moments of *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañ* is the *paccuppanna dhamma* (the present state).   The initial stage of the formation of *viññâna*  which  is  the  present,  the  *nibbattilakkhanâ*  is  the  formation  =  *udaya*.  *Viparinâma* *lakkhanâ* (features subject to change) is dissolution = *vaya*. The ability to repeatedly con- 

template on the *udaya* and *vaya* is the *udayabbayanupassanâ ñâna*. 

`    `[Note.   *Ye  tâva  âcariyâ  mahâvihâravâsinova  yathâ  viññânam*,  *evum  ñâmarûpam*, *salâyatanam, phassam*, *vedanñca*, *paccayam*, *paccayuppannañca* *sasantatipariyâpannam*  *dîpanto vipâkameva icchanti* (*Mahâtî*.-2: 323). 

From  aspects  of  *suttana*,  in  culturing  the  *viññâna*,  *nâma*-*rûpa*,  *salâyatana*, *phassa*, and *vedanâ*, the  *mahâvihâravâsî*  would like to include the  *vipâka vatta*  of the 

` `causes and results during  formation only (*Mahâtî*.-2: 323). 

In  accordance  with  this  opening  acquire  the  *vipâka  vatta*  and  *nâma*-*rûpa*  by *vipâka viññâna* based on the *nâma*-*rûpa* to come and on *viññâ*.  In this *viñña-nâmarûpa* are included all the *vipâka* *vatta*, *viññâna* and *nâma*-*rûpa* which can be formed at any stage from *patisandhe* (birth) to *cuti* (death).  This is the *addhâ paccuppanna* (a present period from the birth consciousness to the death consciousness) *dhamma* among the three kinds of *paccuppanna*.  Here is an advice for you gentleman.  Suppose you are going to live for a hundred years.  Suppose again that you are at present 60 years old.   Then your *patisandhe viññâna* and *nâma-rûpa* have appeared during the past 60 years and the *cuti viññâ* and *nâma-rûpa dhammas* will only have a chance to appear in the remaining 40 years.  And it has been expatiated that these *vipâka vatta dhammas*, which can make their appearance at any time from birth to death, are also *paccuppanna dhammas*.  From point of view of *addhâ*, these all *addhâ paccuppanna dhammas*, but if viewed from *khana pac*- *cuppanna* (momentary present) point these *dhammas* have the chance to arise during the past, future or the present as the case may be.   No matter when these *dhammas* arise, be it during their formation or going to be formed, they are only of the *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañga* (arising, static and dissolution) phenomena.  If you are discerning on these *dhammas* by means of *udayabbayâ nupassanâ ñâna*, concentrate on them during their arising *upâda*  and during their dissolution *bhañga*.] 

4. The  *paramattha  dhamma  sabhâvalakkhanâ*  in  the  making,  called  *paramattha* 

*attabhâva* still acquiring, the *nâma*-*rûpa* within the three moments of *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañ* is the *paccuppanna dhamma* (the present state). The initial stage of the formation of *nâma*- *rûpa* which is the present, the *nibbattilakkhanâ* is the formation = *udaya*.  *Viparinâma* 

*lakkhan*. *â* is dissolution = *vaya*. The ability to repeatedly contemplate on the *udaya* and *vaya* is the *udayabbayanupassanâ ñân*. *a*.   

5. The  *paramattha  dhamma  sabhâvalakkhanâ*  in  the  making,  called  *paramattha* 

*attabhâva* still acquiring, the *nâma*-*rûpa* within the three moments of *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañ* is 

— *cakkhâyatana* (eye-base sense), *sotâyatana* (ear-base sense), *ghânâyatana* (nose-base sense),  *jhivâyatana*  (tongue-base  sense),  *kâyâyatana*  (body-  or  skin-base  sense), 

*manâyatana* (mind-base sense) — the *sa*.*l* *âyatana* which also is *paccuppanna dhamma*.  The initial stage of the formation of *sa*.*l* *âyatana* which is the present, the *nibbattilakkhan*. *â* is the formation = *udaya*.  *Viparinâma* *lakkhanâ* is dissolution = *vaya*. The ability to repeatedly contemplate on the *udaya* and *vaya* is the *udayabbayanupassanâ ñân*. *a*.  (This *sa*.*l* *âyatana* *dhamma* also can arise at any time from conception to the whole life time of a  worldling). 

6. The  *paramattha  dhamma  sabhâvalakkhan*. *â*  in  the  making,  called  *paramattha* 

*attabhâva*  still  acquiring,  the  *phassa*  called  *cakkhusamphassa*  (reaction  of  the  eye), *sotasamphassa* (reaction of the ear), *ghânasamphassa* (reaction of the nose), *jhivâsam- phassa*   (reaction  of  the  tongue),  *kâyasamphassa*  (reaction  of  the  skin/body)  and *manosamphassa* (reaction of mind) etc. , within the three moments of *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañ* is also  the *paccuppanna dhamma* (the present state). The initial stage of the formation of *phassa* which is the present, the *nibbattilakkhan*. *â* is the formation = *udaya*.  *Viparinâma* *lakkhan*. *â* is dissolution = *vaya*. The ability to repeatedly contemplate on the *udaya* and  *vaya* is the *udayabbayanupassanâ ñân*. *a*.   

[**Note**.  This *phassa* also is a *dhamma* that can come into being throughout the life time whenever the door, the object and *viññâ*.*n* *a* become associated, giving respective results.  Suppose a meditator has taken the *cakkhusamphassa* as an object and discern on its arising and perishing away as the character by means of *udayabbayânupassa ñân*. *a*. Then this *cakkhusamphassa* is just a kind of *dhamma* associated with *cakkhu viññâ*.*n* *a*. It is included in *cakkhu dvâra vîthi* (eye door thought process consciousness).  It is the *ahita vipâka nâma dhamma* (a mental property of bad *kamma*-formation).  The *udayabbayânu*- *passanâ ñâna* concentrating on this phassa is *mahâkusala manodvârika jovîthi* (the great moral mind-door thought process consciousness).  (This statement refers only to a yogi, a blessed worldling, who is in the prime of his *udayabbaya ñân*. *a* possession).  The *cakkhu dvâra vîthi* and the *manodvârika jovîthi* are not simlutaneous processes.  One occurs after another.  In the same way, the *cakkhusamphassa* and *udayabbayânupassanâ ñâ*.*n* *a* are not the *dhammas* that would occur in one *cittakkhana* (thought moment) in association with one another.  Let alone a *cittakkhana*, these two *dhammas* would not arise in association  even within one thought process. 

*Dve pana phassâ vâ vedanâ vâ saññâ vâ cetana vâ cittâni vâ ekato uppajjanakâni nâma  natthi*, *ekekameva uppajjati* (*Ma.-Tha.*-4: 60). 

Within a thought moment no two *phassa*, nor *vedanâ*, nor *saññâ*, nor *cedanâ*, nor *citta* can arise simultaneously; it is natural that only one can occur at single a time (*Ma.- Tha.*-4: 60). 

Therefore when *cakkhusamphassa* is arising by way of the *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañga*, the *udayabbaya* *nupassanâ ñâ*.*n* *a*, included in *mahâkusala manodvârika vipassanâ jovîthi*, has not yet appeared via *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañga*.    Again  when this *udayabbaya* *nupassanâ ñâ*.*n* *a*, which is concentrating on the *cakkhusamphassa* as *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañga* is arising, the *cakkhusamphassa* is not the kind of *dhamma* which still remains arising by *upâda*-*thî*- *bhañga*.   It is so because no two different consciousnesses can appear within the duration of a *cittakhana*.  This *udayabbayâ nupassanâ ñân*. *a*, however, can meditate on and see the *cakkhusamphassa* during its *upâda* (arising) and *bhañga* (dissolution) stages.  Hence the  Patisambhidhâ Magga Pâli has expounded as follow. 

. 

*Jâto phasso paccuppanno*, *tassa nibbattilakkhanam ud*. *ayo*, *vipariññâmalakkhanam vayo*,  

. 

*anupassanâ ñâna* (*Patisam*.: 52). (For its translation see No. 6 above). 

Because *udayabbayâ* *nupassanâ ñâna* and the object *cakkhusamphassa* cannot arise within a single *cittakkhana*, while *udayabbayâ* *nupassanâ ñâna* is in existence as *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañga* the *cakkhusamphassa* cannot be present as *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañga*.  Care must be exercised in the fact that the *paccuppanna* here does not necessarily means the  popular *paccuppanna* of daily use.] 

7. The  *paramattha  dhamma  sabhâvalakkhanâ*  in  the  making,  called  *paramattha* 

*attabhâva*  still  acquiring,  the  *vedanâ*  such  as  *cakkhusamphassajâ  vedanâ*  (suffering), *sotasamphassajâ vedanâ*, *ghânasamphassajâ vedanâ*, *jhivâsamphassajâ vedanâ* , *kâya- samphassajâ vedanâ* and *manosamphassajâ vedanâ* etc., within the three moments of *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañ* is also  the *paccuppanna dhamma* . The initial stage of the formation of *phassa* which is the present, the *nibbattilakkhanâ* is the formation = *udaya*.  *Viparinâma* *lakkhanâ* is dissolution = *vaya*. The ability to repeatedly concentrate on the *udaya* and  *vaya* is the *udayabbaya nupassanâ ñâna*.   

8. The  *paramattha  dhamma  sabhâvalakkhanâ*  in  the  making,  called  *paramattha* 

*attabhâva* still acquiring, the *tahnâ* such as *rûpatahnâ* (craving of form), *saddatahnâ* (craving  of  sound),  *ghanda  tahnâ*  (craving  of  smell),  *rasa  tahnâ*  (craving  of  taste), *pholabba tahnâ* (craving of touch) and *dhamma tahnâ* (craving of mental phenomena) etc., within the three moments of *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañ* is also  the *paccuppanna dhamma* . The initial stage of the formation of *tahnâ* which is the present, the *nibbattilakkhanâ* is the formation = *udaya*.  *Viparinâma* *lakkhanâ* is dissolution = *vaya*. The ability to repeatedly  discern on the *udaya* and *vaya* is the *udayabbayanupassanâ ñâna*.   

[**Note**.  The object of concentration by *udayabbaya nupassanâ ñâna* is the *tahnâ*.  It is the *akusala dhamma*.  The *udayabbayâ nupassanâ ñâna* that appears in the *santâna* (continuum)  of  yogis  of  a  worldling  status  is  the  *kusala  dhamma*.   The  *kusala*  and *akusala* *dhammas* do not arise simultaneously within  a  period of *cittakhana*.  It must be noted that these two are not the kind of *dhammas* that occur at the same time.  However, this *tahnâ* has the chance to appear at any time throughout *addhâ paccuppanna* existence whenever the conditions prevail.  The *udayabbatâ nupassanâ ñâna* possesse the ability to  exercise *vipassanâ* concentration on the *tahnâ* during its *upâda* and *bhañga* phases.] 

9. The  *paramattha  dhamma  sabhâvalakkhanâ*  in  the  making,  called  *paramattha* 

*attabhâva* still acquiring, the* corresponding *upâdana* such as *kâmupâdâna* (clinging to sensual  form),  *ditthupâdana*  (clinging  to  wrong  view),  *sîlabbatupâdana*  (clinging  to ceremonial observences), *attavâdupâda* (clinging to one's own personality) etc., within the three moments of *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañ* is also  the *paccuppanna dhamma* . The initial stage of the formation of *upâdâna* which is the present, the *nibbattilakkhanâ* is the formation = *udaya*.  *Viparinâma* *lakkhanâ* is dissolution = *vaya*. The ability to repeatedly discern on 

` `the *udaya* and *vaya* is the *udayabbayanupassanâ ñâna*. 

*Upapattihetubhûtam kammam kammabhavo*.  *Kammâbhinibbattâ khandhâ upapattibhavo*  (*Visuddhi*-2: 208; *Abhi*,-*Tha*.-2: 177). 

*Upapattibhvuppattiyeva jâti* (*Mahâtî*.-2: 334) 

With reference to the above stanza life is of *kammabhava* (sensual existence) and *upapattibhava* (process of becoming).  The *kamma*, which is the cause of *upapattibhava*, is the *kammabhava*; the aggregates which arise as a result of this *kamma* are the *upapatti- bhava*.  The rising of this *upapattibhava* is the *jâti* (the future life).  If the period of *pac*- *cuppanna* is taken to present the midway, then the *kammabhava* is *addhâ paccuppanna*, the *upapattibhava* called the *jâti* represents the time to come.  This *bhava* will again be 

` `described as two separate kinds.   

- . 

*Jâto bhavo paccuppanno*, *tassa nibbattilakkh*. *anam ud*.*a* *yo*, *viparinâmalakkhanam vayo*,  *anupassanâñânam* (*Pa*.*t* *isam*.: 52). 

10 (A)  The *paramattha dhamma sabhâvalakkha*.*n* *â* in the making, called *paramattha* *attabhâva* still acquiring, the *kammabhava* , within the three moments of *upâda*-*thî*-*bhañ* is the *paccuppanna dhamma*. The initial stage of the formation of *kammabhava* which is the present, the *nibbattilakkhanâ* is the formation = *udaya*.  *Viparinâma* *lakkhan*. *â* is dissolution = *vaya*. The ability to repeatedly discern on the *udaya* and *vaya* is the *udayab- bayanupassanâ ñâ*.*n* *a*. 

(B)  The *paramattha dhamma sabhâvalakkhan*. *â* in the making, called *paramattha* 

*attabhâva* still acquiring, the *upapattibhava* , within the three moments of *upâda*-*thî*- *bhañ* is the *paccuppanna dhamma*. The initial stage of the formation of *upapattibhava* which  is  the  present,  the  *nibbattilakkhan*. *â*  is  the  formation  =  *udaya*.   *Viparinâma* *lakkhan*. *â* is dissolution = *vaya*. The abilit.y  to repeatedly discern on the *udaya* and *vaya* is  the *udayabbayanupassanâ ñâ*.*n* *a* (*Pa*.*t* *isam*.: 52). 

It  must  be  noted  that  in  the  above  Patisambhidâ  Magga  Pâli  all  the  *paticca* *samuppâda* factors from *avijjâ* to *upapattibhava*, called *jâti*, have been equally treated as the *paccuppana dhamma*.  But if a breakdown is made on a temporal basis, if the present  period is taken to represent the mid-period, then 

1. *Avijjâ* and *sankhâra* are the *dhamma* groups of the first past period. 
1. *Viññâna*, *nâma-rûpa*, *salâyatana, phassa, vedanâ, tahnâ, upâdâna*, and *kamma-* 
1. *bhava*.  are the *dhamma* gr.o ups of the present period. 
1. The *upapattibhava*, named the *jâti*, is the *dhamma* group of the future period. 

All these *dhammas* have been expatiated to be the *paccuppannadhamma*.  It must be noted that this expation means the *paccuppannadhamma* involved in *udayabbaya- ñâ*.*n* *a*. 

Now what it means is this.  In discerning on these *pa*.*t* *icca samuppâda* features via *udayabbayânupassanâ  ñân*. *a*,  arising  *upâda*  and  dissolving  *phases  bhañga*  of  these* features must be mentally captured by virtue of this *ñân*. *a.*  These *dhammas*, during *upâda* and *bhañga* phases, are *paccuppanna dhammas*.  Now go on to the following opening of  the book of doctrines. 

. ***Jâtan**ti nibbattam patiladdhattabhâvum*.  *Ayam hi jâtasaddo khanattaya*. *samañgitam*  

*sandhâ vutto* — *"yedhammâ jâtâ bhûtâ*"*tiâdîsu viya*, *na atîtam —* 

"*Ye te jâtâ*, *na te santi*, *ye na jâtâ*, *tattheva te*. *Laddhattabhâvâ no bhaggâ*, *teva santi sabhâvato*"*ti —* 

- .  .  . 

*Ãdîsu viya*.  *Nâpi jâtatâmattam*, "*yam tam jâtam bhûtam*.  *sañkhat*"*an*. *tâdîsu viya*.  *Tenâha* "***jâtam rûpam paccuppann***"*anti*.  *Paccuppannarûpam nâma jâtam khanattayapariyâ- pannati attho* (*Mahâ*.*t* *î.*-2: 419). 

*Jâta* is an *attabho* (a form) that come into being and which can be acquired. (The *attabho* is said to have attained when *paramattha dhâtu,* the ultimate element, that has materialized via *upâda-thî-bhañga* into distinct form). 

This *jâta*-*saddâ* has been expatiated as follows. 

*Ye dhamma jâtâ bhûtâ* — (*Abhi*.-1: 213).  These *dhammas* are really formed and distinctly  so.   As  explained  in  the  texts,  with  reference  to   *upâda-thî-bhañga*  called *khanattayasamañgî* = the state of being com.p lete with all the three *khanas* (moments), it is expounded as *jâtam*  *rûpam* *paccuppannam* (*jâtâ*, *avijjâ*, *paccuppanna*) etc. in the  Patisambhidhâ Magga Pâli. 

"*Ye te jâtâ na te santi*.  R.  *Teva santi sabhâvato* =  These *dhammas* have already arisen, hence these past *dhammas* are no longer present.  Those which have not arisen yet are the future *dhammas* and are not present yet.  The *dhammas* which have materialized via  *upâda-thî-bhañga*  into  distinct  form  is  the  *paramattha  dhâtu*,  which  have  not dissolved yet, but still in existence.  These are the only *dhammas* which are still present as *sankhata paramattha sabhâva* (ultimate reality produced by specific actions).  In such  cases *jâta saddâ* is expatiated as not referring to past *dhammas*.   

"*Yam tam jâtam bhûtam sankhatam* (*Dî*.-2: 119; *Sam*.-3: 141).   A a resultant *dhamma* has appeared, and distinctly so.  This is the result of combined actions of the 

` `causes.  That *dhamma* will disolve and cannot be wished not to do so." 

In these doctrines, *jâtasaddâ* is expounded to be just the formation = *jâtamatta*.  In this stanza *jâtam rûpam paccuppannam*.  R.  *Jâtâ avijjâ paccuppannâ* etc., the *jâtasad*- *dâ* does not even instruct *jâtamatta* = the nature of just the formation.  What is instructed is that it is complete with the three *khanas* (moments) such as *upâda-thî-bhañga* called *khanattayasamangî*.  Therefore what it is means that — *jâtam rûpam paccuppanam*  = the present corporeality,  *jâtâ avijjâ paccuppannâ* = the present *avijjâ* is the *dhamma* icluded in the three moments as *upâda-thî-bhañga* (*Mahâtî*. 2: 419).  This should suffice to apprehend *paccuppanna dhamma* in section on *udayabbayâ nupassanâ ñâna*.  But this not all there is to it.  In Ãhâra Suttan desanâ of Nidânavaggasamyutta Pâli instruction was oriented towards past factors.  Therefore, meditation can be made on the causal relation- ship, *paticca samuppâda* of the consecutive pasts.  For instance see the following to note. 

1. *Avijjâ, sankhâra* (*dhamma* groups of second past period). 
1. *Viññâna,  nâma-rûpa,  salâyatana,  phassa,  vedanâ,  upâdâna,  kammabhava* (*dhamma* groups of the first past). 
1. *Jâti, jarâmarana* (*dhamma* groups of the *paccuppana* period).  

This has to be understood.  (For concentration on a broader base see Sections on  *Paticca samuppâda* and *Udayabbayâ nupassanâ ñâna*). 

This *Udayabbayâ nupassanâ ñâna* also is the *Tîranapariññâ*.  The above descrip- tions made in association with the characters of *Paticca samuppâda*, which are \_ 

1. *Ñâtapariññâ* called *Nâma-rûpa pariccheda ñâna*, *paccaya pariggaha ñâna*, 
1. *Tîranapariññâ* called *Sammasana ñâna*, *Udayabbaya ñâna*. 

Suppose you want to analyze as to whether these *pariññâ ñâna* are *paccakkha* *ñâna* or *anvaya ñâna*.  Then examine the following extracts from Samyutta Pâli,  Athakthâ Tîkâs. 

*Virâgampâham bhikkave saupanisam vadâmi, no anupanisam.  Kâ ca bhikkave virâgassa upanisâ.  "Nibbidâ"tissa vacanîyam.  Nibbidampâham bhikkave upanisam vadâmi, no anupanisam.  Kâ ca bhikkhave nibbidâya upanisâ, "yathâbhûtañânadassan"anatissa*  *vacanîyam*  (*Sam*.-1: 268; *Upanisa Suttan*). 

***Nibbidâ**ti nibbdâñânam*.  *Etena balavipassanam dassati*.  ***Balavippassanâ**ti bhayatûpathâne ñânam âdînavânupassane ñânam moncitukamayatâñânam* 

*sankhârûpekkhâñânanti catonnam ñânam adhivacanam*.  ***Yathâbhûtañâdassan**anti Yathâsabhâvabhâvajânanasankhâtam dassanam*.  *Etena tarunavipassanam dassati*.  

*Tarunavipassanâ hi balavipassanâya paccayo hoti*. ***Tarunavipassanâ**ti* *sankhâra- pariccheda ñânam kankhâvitarane ñânam sammasane ñânam maggamagge ñânanti  catonnam ñânam adhivacanam* (*Sam.-Tha.-*2: 50). 

*Paccakkhakaranattena ñâtapariññâ tîranapariññâ ca gahitâ hoti* (*Sam*.-*Tî*.-2: 65). 

Bhikkhus .... I preach to you that the Arahattamagga, where *râga* (lust) has been eradicated, arise because of the cause.  I do not preach to you that it arises with cause.  What is the cause of the Arahattamagga?  It is the *nibbidâ ñâna* (knoweldge of aversion)  which has become wearied of worldly life.  Bhikkhus .... I preach to you that the *nibbidâ ñâna*, which have had enough of this life, also arises due to the cause.  I do not preach to you that it has arisen without a cause.  Then what is the cause of knowledge of getting enough of the worldly life, the *nibbidâ ñâna*?  It is the *yathâbhutañânadassana*, the knowledge of vision by power of which the nature of truth of *sankhâra*s are appreciated  (*Sam*.-1: 268; *Upanisa Suttan*). 

`    `***Nibbidâñâna*** — *Bhayatûpathâna ñâna* (the knowledge that concentrate on the fear), *âdînavânupassanâ  ñâna*  (the  knowledge  that  realizes  evil  consequence), *muncitukamayatâ*  *ñâna*  (knowledge  and  *sankhârûpekkhâ  ñâna*  the  four  kinds  of knowledge called powerful *bhalavavipassanâ ñâna*.  This *bhalavavipassanâ ñâna*  is said to be the *nibbiddâ ñâna*.  This *nibbidda ñâna* is the very cause of attaining the *arahatta*  *magga*. 

`    `***Yathâbhûtañânadassana*** — This is the knowledge which has the ability to understand the true nature of the *Sankhâras*.  *Tarunavipassanâ* is the *vupassanâ ñâna* in its early (or immature) stage.  (1)  *Sankhârapariccheda ñâna* referred to as the *nâma-rûpapariccheda  ñâna*, (2) *Kankhâvitarana ñâna* referred to as the *paccayapariggaha ñâna*, (3) *Sammasa*- *na ñâna*, (4) *Maggâmagga ñâna* referred to as *udayabbayâ nupassanâ ñâna* — these four are the ***tarunavipassanâ*** = *vipassanâ ñâna* in its early stage*.*  Now this *tarunavipassanâ*  is the very cause of *balavavipassanâ* (*Sam*. *Tha*.-2: 50). 

In ***Yathâbhûtañânadassana*** *ñâtapariññâ*** called** the** *nâma*-*rûpapariccheda ñâna* and  *paccayapariggaha*  *ñâna*,  *tîranapariññâ*  called  the  *sammasana  ñâna*  and  the  *udayabbayânupassanâ ñâna* with referecne to which the meaning of *yathâbhûtañâna-*

*dassana* has been given in the atthakathâ.  Because of the nature of the concept that they have the ability to have clear vision of the *sankhâra dhammas* called  *dukkha saccâ*, *samudaya saccâ* etc. by means of *paccekkha*, the *ñâtapariññâ* and *tîranapariññâ*  are  taken from aspect of *yatthâ*-*bhûtadassana* to give the meaning (*Sam*.-*Tî*.-2: 65).  

In accordance with the above Pâli Atthakathâ Tîka note as follows. 

1. *Nâma*-*rûpapariccheda ñâna* which is the knowledge that can discern the corporeality and mentality  of *paticca samuppâda* as two separate groups, 
1. *Paccayapariggaha ñâna* which is the knowledge that can discern on the nature of the cause and its consequences separately as paticca samuppâda factors which occurs again and again, 
1. (i)  *Paccayato  udayavaya*,  (ii)  *Khanato  udayavaya*  of  these  *paticca  samuppâda* characters  —  the  two  kinds  of  features  called  formation  and  dissolution,  the *udayavaya*  and  the  true  nature  of  their  being  *anicca*  (impermanence),  *dukkha* (suffering) and *anatta* (non-self) which can be visualized mentally by *sammasana ñâna* and *udayabbayâ nupassanâ ñâna* — these are the *paccekkha ñâna* (the practical  knowledge). 

If so, the question arises as to whether cannot these *paticca samuppâda* characters be concentrated by means of ***anvaya ñâna*** (reviewing knowledge).  This can be answered  based on the following. 

*Nayadassanavasena vâ evum vuttam*.  *Pathmañhi paccuppannadhammânam  udayabbayam disvâ atha atîtânâgate nayam neti* (*Mahâtî*.-2: 423). 

In other words — it is stated by *nayadassa* in this way.  In the first place discern on the *udayabbaya* of the *paccuppana dhammas* (the present *dhammas*), following which concentrate on those of the past and future in a similar way (*Pyî*.-*Visuddhimagga nissaya*  -5: 165). 

**Note.**  After culturing *paccuppanna dhamma* indicated in this *udayabbaya ñâna*, and *udayabbaya* of these *paccakkha dhamma* by means of *paccakkha ñâna*, meditate on  the *dhammas* of the past and future following this way. 

*Ñâtapariññâ* and *tîranapariññâ* which are associated with the characters of the *paticca samuppâda* have been treated, and now *pahânapariññâ* will be described in  continuation. 

***Pahânapariññâ*** — The meditation on the dissolution only of the three general characters, taken alternately as objects, of the *paticca samuppâda* are the knowledges  from *bhañga ñâna* to higher order *vipassanâ ñâna*.  These are called ***Pahânapariññâ*** because  it  enables  one  to  analytically  to  know  that  has  to  known  and  relieving momentarily from factors of *kilesâ* that have to be eradicated, the states of *anicca*, *dukkha* and *anatta*, which are the characters of *paticca samuppâda*.  These are the three *lokipa*- *riññâ*. 

In Patisambhidâmagga Pâli (*Patisam*.- 55), the list of objects of concentration by knowledge of *bhañgâ nupassanâ ñâna* have been counted from *avijjâ* (ignorance) to *jarâmarana* (ageing, decay and death) of the characters of *paticca samuppâda*.  So a meditator should concentrate on these characters of *paticca samuppâda* by the knowledge 

of *bhañgâ nupassanâ ñâna*.  In the exercise of *viapssanâ* via *bhañgâ nupassanâ ñâna*, the objectsp on which the *vipassanâ* is made, the characters from *avijjâ* to *jarâmarana* are the ***sampatidittha sankhâra dhammas***.  The *avijjâ* etc. which have escaped cocnentration by *bhanñgâ nupassanâ ñâna* are the ***sampatiadittha sankhâra dhammas***.   These *sampa*- *tiadittha sankhâra dhammas* are explained as — *aditthampi atîtâgatam* — etc. (Mahâtî.- 2: 442).  The following instruction is directed to exercise *vipassanâ* concentration on the  past and future, which are *sampatiadittha sankhâra dhammas*, by means of *anvaya ñâna*. 

*Atha vâ so evum viriyatto yathâdittham sankhâratam*, *tathâ aditthampi anvayañâna- vasena nirodheti*,  *no samudeti*.  *Nirodhatova manasikaroti*.  *nIrodhamevassa passati, no  samudayanti attho*  (*Visuddhi*-2: 279). 

***Evumviratto**ti evum bhañgânupassanâsârena viratto*.  *Yathâ dittham sampati sankhâra- gatam nirodheti norodham manasikaroti*, *aditthampi atîtânâgatam anvayañânavasena* 

*yathâ idam etarahi*, *evum itarepîti anuminanto nirodheti manasikatassâpi nirodham karoti*.  ***No samudetî**ti ettâpi eseva nayo*, *no samudayam manasikarotîti attho*  
\*
` `(*Mahâtî*-2: 442)  

*Ñâtañca ñâtañca ubhopi vipassati* (*Visuddhi*-2: 278) 

Because the *dhammas* such as *avijâ* to *jarâmarana* in *paticca samuppâda* are the object to exercise *vipassâ* meditation on via *bhañâ* *nupassan ñâna*, they are the ***ñâta***.  The  knowledge  which  is  concentrating on these *ñâta  dhammas*  is  ***ñâna***.  In  *bhañgâ nupassanâ ñâna* a meditator has to meditate on the dissolution of the *ñâta* taking it as the object.  The dissolution of these *ñâta dhammas* too are taken a object and meditate on it. And these are the *pativipassanâ* and is the kind of knowledge which takes both *ñâta* and *ñâna* as object in concentrating.  These *ñâta* and *ñâna dhammas* are referred to as the 

` `*sankhâra dhamma*. 

As the meditator always follows the *bhañgâ nupassanâ ñâna* way, and who is free of attachment *râga* (by being able to be deflected  for a considerable duration from), can take to heart the followings which appear at the comencement of practically visible  knowledge-- 

1. The *ñâta dhammas* from *avijjâ* to *jarâmarana*, 
1. The *ñâna dhammas* called *vipassanâ ñâna* which is discerning on the perishing  

`         `away of these *ñâta dhammas*. 

In the same way as taking these *dhammas* to heart, the *sampati adittha* which has 

been meditated, not visualized and therefore has not appeared at the comencement of practically visible knowledge = the sampati anupatthita (those from *avijjâ* to *jarâ maana*) so should the past and future *sankhâra dhammas* be taken, by means of *anvaya ñâna*, as to be perishable.  In such meditation, the present *sankhâra dhammas* as well as the past and future *sankhâra dhammas* are comparatively taken as objects and the nature of their  cessation taken to heart, but not the *samudaya* (arising) of their's.  It means that these *dhammas* are taken from view point of cessation = only cessation is taken to heart.  The concentration is made on the nature of their cessation, but not their *samudaya* (*Visuddhi* - 2: 279; *Mahâtî*.-2: 442). 

**Them Three *Lokuttara Pariññâ*** 

At  the  end  of  *lokîpariññâ  pañâ*  called  *vipassanâ*  knowledge  the  *ariyamagga* *dhamma*  distinctly  appears  taking  *asankhata  dhâtu*  (absolute  element),  element  of freedom (from the worldly affiars) the *nibbâna dhamma* as the object.  This ariyamagga dhamma  knows  penetratively  the  respective   defilements  that  have  to  be  absolutely eradicated  and  *asankhata  dhâtu*,  element  of  freedom,  and  *nibbâna  dhamma*  by  the  *samuccheda* (abandoned defilements permanently).  Therefore, the *ariyamagga dhamma*  is definitely named ***pahâparññâ***. 

*Ariyamagga dhamma* is the vision of the object penetratively = to the *asankhata dhâtu*, the element of freedom the *nibbâna dhamma* objectively via *Ãramanapatideva*. In knowing so support is  acquired by the force of *ârammanapativeda* of the *asankhata dhâtu*, the element of freedom the *nibbâna dhamma*.  Because of such a support the *moha* *dhamma* (bewilderment factor), which is a hinderance to knowledge of the Four Noble Truths, is completely eradicated.  By this eradication acquirement of the knowledge of the Four Noble Truths is simultaneously attained.  The knowledge of the Four Noble Truths by way of *kiccasiddhi* (acquired knowledge)* is called *asammohapativeda*.  Then the *ariyamagga dhamma* knows the *Nirodha Saccâ* (Truth of Cessation of Suffering) by virtue of *ârammanapativeda*.  By virtue of *asammohapativeda*  the *Dukkha Saccâ* (the Truth of Suffering), the *Samudaya Saccâ* (the Truth of Arising) and *Magga Saccâ* (the Truth of the Path) are known.  Because of knowing this way, the *ariyamagga dhamma* has  completely acquired the knowledge of *dukkha saccâ* and *samudaya saccâ*, called *paticca samuppâda* features, and the nature of inter-relationship among these features.  Viewed from these aspects the *ariyamagga dhamma* also is known as *ñâtapariññâ*. 

Again this aruyamagga dhamma also annihilates completely the *moha* (delusion) which hinders the appreciation of the *anicca*, *dukkha* and *anatta* factors.   By annihilating so, the characters of the *paticca samuppâda* named *dukkha saccâ* and *samudaya saccâ*, referred to as *rûpa*-*nâma*-cause-consequence = *sankhâra dhammas*, and the function of investigating and analysing these *dhammas* by *kiccasiddhi* are simultaneously accom- plished.  Therefore, when viewed from this aspect *ariyamagga dhamma* can also be  nominated as ***tîranapariñña***.  These are the three *lokuttarapariññâ*. 

Only if the relationship of the cause and consequences, *paticca samuppâda*, are penetratively known by one's self via the *lokîpariññâ* and *lokuttarapariññâ*, of three each, called the *attapaccekkha ñâna*, can this knowledge be called knowledge by *anubodha ñâna* and *pativedha ñâna*.   One can excape from *apâya* (miserable existence), *samsâra*  

` `(rounds of rebirths), *dukkha* (suffering) and *samsâra vatta dukkha* (suffering due to one's action) besides *apâya,* only if the *dhammas* of the *paticca samuppâda* are penetratively 

` `known by one's self via *attapaccekkha ñâna*.  There never has been an instance, even in the dream, where any one escaped from the *samsâra vatta dukkha* without knowledge of visualizing, by *anubodha ñâna* and *pativedha ñâna* called the *attapaccekkha ñâna*, the *dhammas* of the *paticca samuppâda*.  This is all there is to the extracts from the above 

` `Mahânidâna Suttan. 

In discerning via *sammâditthi ñâna*, by a *yogâvacara* individual (a meditator), on *paticca samuppâda dhammas*, formation of *sankhâra* due to *avijjâ*, formation of *viññâna* due to *sankhâra* etc. are not the only objects to concentrate on, but also on the process of  

cessation of *sankhâraloka*, such as the cessation of *sankhâra* due to cessation of *avijjâ*, the cessation of *viññâna* due to cessation of *sankhâra*.  It was instructed to do so by the  Buddha himself in Kiccâna Suttan and other Suttanas (see *Sam*.-1: 257 etc.).   

The  formation  *udaya*  of  the  *sankhâra*  is  said  to  be  ***Lokasamudaya***,  and  its  dissolution *vaya* the *lokanirodha*.  In another way, the process of  formation of *sankhâra* due to *avijjâ*, and the formation of *viññâna* due to *sankhâra* also is called ***Lkasamudaya***, and also ***Anulomapaccayâkâra***.  The complete cessation of *avijjâ* due to *arahattamagga* 

- ***asesaviraga*,** non-reappearable cessation = cessation by nature of ***Anuppâdanirodha*** due which the resultants of *sankhâra* etc. ceased completely = ***asesaviraga* =** dissolution by means of non-reappearable cessation etc. of the process of cessation of *sankhâraloka*  is also the ***Lokanirodha***, and also called the ***Patilomapaccâkâra***. 

These *lokasamudaya*, *lokanirodha* which are  arising and perishing away of the *sankhâra* and  *anulomapaccâkâra*  =  *anulomapaticca  samuppâda*,  *patilomapaccayâkâra*  = philosophy of *patilomapaticca samuppâda*, and when these are concentrated what would be the results?  Should a meditator be contended with what has been handed down from the predecessors?  Should one be meditating speculatively by means of *anvaya ñâna* only?   To these questions, the following is the answer extracted from  Kiccânagotta Suttan.  

**Extract from *Kiccânagotta Suttana*** 

Once the Buddha was staying in the City of Sâvatthi.  Then the Venerable Kiccâ- nagotta approached the Buddha, took a seat at an appropriate place, and after paying homage, enquired of the Buddha a right answer to his query.  My Lord it has said that the right view = *sammâditthi*, the right view = *sammâditthi*.  Now what is the right view = *sammâditthi*?  In answer to this query, the Buddha sermon *desanâ* nomonated as the  Kiccânagotta Suttana.  The following are some extracts from this *suttana*. 

*Dvayanissito khâyam kiccâna loko yebuñyenaattitañceva natthitañca*.  *Lokasamudayam kho kiccâna yathâbhûtam sammappañâya passato yâ loke natthitâ*, *sâ na hoti*. *Lokani- rodham kho kiccâna yathâbhûtam sammappañâya passato yâ loke atthitâ*, *sâ na hoti*. *Upayupâdâbhinivesavinibbandho khvâyam kiccâna loko yebuñyena*, *tañcâyam uyupâdâ- nam cetaso adhithânam abhinivesânusayam na upeti na upâdiyati "attâ me"ti*.

257-258).*
