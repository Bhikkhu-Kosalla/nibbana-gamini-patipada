**PAṬICCA SAMUPPĀDA STAGE (5TH METHOD)**

(English translation has not yet been edited.)

As taught in Mahā Nidāna Sutta:

Gambhīro cāyaṁ Ānanda paṭicca samuppādo gambhīrāvabhāso ca.
Etassacānanda dhammassa ananubodhā appaṭivedhā evamayaṁ pajā tantākulakajāṭa gulāgaṇṭhikajāta muñjapabbajabhūta apāyaṁ duggati, vinipātaṁ saṁsāraṁ nātivattati (Dīgha Nikāya; Saṁyutta Nikāya) -- Ānanda, this Paṭicca Samuppāda the Causal Relationship is deep and it appears deep.
Because of not realizing this Paṭicca Samuppāda penetratively by means of the 3 Pariññā Ñāṇa which are:

1. Ñāta Pariññā,

2. Tīraṇa Pariññā and

3. Pahāna Pariññā;

and not attaining Magga Phala Ñāṇa, living beings become entangled in Saṁsāra like a knotted ball of thread, like weaverbird&#39;s nest, like a tangled grass foot-mat where the beginning and the end of the grass cannot be found; and they cannot escape from Apāya Duggati Saṁsāra.

Referring to the above Teaching, the Commentator taught as follows:

_Ñāṇāsinā samādhipavarasilāyam sunisitena bhavacakkamapadāletvā, asanivicakkamiva niccanimmathanaṁ.
Saṁsārabhayamatīto, na koci supinantarepyatthi_ (Vism., XVII, 344) - There is no one, even in a dream, who can overcome the Saṁsāra rounds of suffering without being able to severe the Paṭicca Samuppāda = the Saṁsāra Wheel of causal relationships which is always oppressing living beings like thunderbolt, with the sword i.e.
Ñāṇa which is well-sharpened on the Noble whetstone i.e.
Samādhi.

According to the above teachings of the Text and Commentary, the meditator who wants to attain Nibbāna must try to realise Paṭicca Samuppāda, the causal relationships by means of the three Pariññā which are Ñāta Pariññā called Anubodha ñāṇa; Tīraṇa Pariññā and Pahāna Pariññā called Paṭivedha ñāṇa.
As Buddha had taught that one cannot overcome and escape from Saṁsāra because of not knowing with Anubodha insight again and again for many times and not knowing with Paṭivedha ñāṇa insight penetratively until the attainment of Magga &amp; Phala, one must try to realise Anubodha and Paṭivedha insight knowledges.
Understand that &#39;to realise&#39; does not mean to know by inference or guessing; and not just by quoting the teacher&#39;s words.

**Three Lokiya Pariññā**

1. **Ñāta Pariññā:-** If one can thoroughly discern by insight the Characteristic-Function-Manifestation-Proximate Cause )Lakkhaṇa-Rasa-Paccupaṭṭhāna-Padaṭṭhāna) of the Paṭicca Samuppāda factors which are Avijjā, Saṅkhāra, Viññāṇa, NāmāRūpa, Saḷāyatana, Phassa, Vedanā, Taṇhā, Upādāna, Bhava, Jāti, JarāMaraṇa...etc, then that insight is called NāmaRūpaPariccheda ñāṇa.

If realise by oneself penetratively the causal relationships such as &quot;Because of the arising of Avijjā, Saṅkhāra arises; Because of the arising of Saṅkhāra, Viññāṅa arises...&quot;etc, then that insight is Paccaya Pariggaha ñāṅa.
These two insights, i.e.
NāmaRūpaPariccheda ñāṇa and Paccaya Pariggaha ñāṅa are called Ñāta Pariññā; this is because these are the insight which discerns and distinguishes the Saṅkhāra dhamma which should be known and are the object of Vipassanā meditation.

2. **Tīraṇa Pariññā:** - After having discerned by insight Anicca, Dukkha and Anatta characteristics of the Paṭicca Samuppāda factors such as Avijjā, Saṅkhāra, Viññāṇa, Nāmarūpa...etc, both the Sammasana ñāṇa and udayabbaya ñāṇa which can investigate, reflect and decide it as &#39;Anicca&#39; or &#39;Dukkha&#39; or &#39;Anatta&#39; are called Tīraṇa Pariññā.
   It is the discerning Paññā which investigates, reflects and decides on the Anicca, Dukkha and Anatta characteristics of the Paṭicca Samuppāda factors.

3. **Pahāna Pariññā:** - After having discerned thoroughly by insight the perishing away only of the Paṭicca Samuppāda factors, the upper Vipassanā ñāṇa beginning from Bhaṅga ñāṇa which meditates on the Three Characteristics alternately and eradicates the respective Kilesa temporarily (Tadaṅga) is called Pahāna Pariññā as it distinguishes and know the Anicca, Dukkha and Anatta characteristics of the Paṭicca Samuppāda.
   These are the three Lokiya Pariññā.

**Three Lokuttarā Pariññā**

At the end of the Vipassanā ñāṇa which is the Lokiya Pariññā Paññā, Ariya Magga comes to arise.
The Ariya Magga totally eradicates (Samuccheda) the respective Kilesa accordingly and realise the Asaṅkhata Dhātu Peaceful Element Nibbāna penetratively.
Therefore Pahāna Pariññā is the Mukhya name for Magga.

The Ariya Magga realises Asaṅkhata Dhātu Peaceful Element Nibbāna penetratively by means of Ārammaṇa Paṭivedha.
In realising like that, the Ariya Magga totally remove Moha which conceals the Four Noble Truths and make one not able to realise the Four Noble Truths.
As it removes the Moha that conceal Four Noble Truths, the task to realise the Four Noble Truths is completed.
Realising the Noble Truths by means of Kicca Siddhi like that is called Āsammoha Paṭivedha.
Among them, the Ariya Magga realises the Nirodha Sacca by means of Ārammaṇa Paṭivedha.
Dukkha Sacca, Samudaya Sacca and Magga Sacca are realised by means of Asammoha Paṭivedha.
Therefore, as the Ariya Magga has completed the task of realising the Paṭicca Samuppāda factors and their causal relationships called Dukkha Sacca and Samudaya Sacca, it is also called Ñāta Pariññā indirectly.

Furthermore the Ariya Magga also totally remove the Moha that conceals Anicca, Dukkha and Anatta characteristics of Dukkha Sacca and Samudaya Sacca.
Therefore the task of investigating, reflecting and deciding on the Anicca, Dukkha and Anatta characteristics of Rūpa-Nāma-Causes-Effects = Saṅkhāra dhamma called Dukkha Sacca &amp; Samudaya Sacca is completed.
Thus the Ariya Magga is also called Tīraṇa Pariññā indirectly.
These are the three Lokuttarā Pariññā.

Only after having realised by oneself Paṭicca Samuppāda i.e.
the causal relationships by means of Lokiya Pariññā Paññā and Lokuttarā Pariññā Paññā then it can be called Anubodha realization and Paṭivedha realization.
Only after having realised the Paṭicca Samuppāda by means of Anubodha and Paṭivedha realizations like that then one can overcome and escape from Saṁsāra.
This is what is meant by the above statement from Nidāna Sutta.

**Anubodha And Paṭivedha Insights**

Ananubodhāti ñātapariññāvasena ananubujjhanā appaṭivedhāti tīraṇappahāna pariññāvasena apaṭivijjhana (Digha Nikāya Commentary-Vol.II-85, Burmese script).

According to the explanation to the sub-commentary &quot;AnuAnubujjhanaṭṭhena Anubodho&quot;, as the task of realising these two dhammas:

1. NāmaRūpa which should be distinguished and realised by NāmaRūpa Pariccheda ñāṇa and

2. the causal relationships between Causes and Effects which should be distinguished and realised by Paccaya Pariggaha ñāṇa

is not completed by knowing them for one time only but can be completed by knowing for many times, again and again, therefore the NāmaRūpa Pariccheda ñāṇa and Paccaya Pariggaha ñāṇa are called Anubodha ñāṇa.
The knowing by means of Anubodha ñāṇa is Anubodha realization.
This is Ñāta Pariññā realization.

The realization by means of Tīraṇa Pariññā and Pahāna Pariññā is called Paṭivedha realization.
Vipassanā insights are called Pahāna Pariññā indirectly.
Pahāna Pariññā is the Mukhya name for Ariya Magga.
Therefore take note that the penetrative realization of NāmaRūpa called Dukkha Sacca and the penetrative realization of Paṭicca Samuppāda i.e.
causal relationships called Samudaya Sacca by means of Tīraṇa Pariññā and Pahāna Pariññā Paññā until the end in attaining Magga Phala is called Paṭivedha realization.

These two insights:

1. penetrative realization by oneself of the Paṭicca Samuppāda factors such as Avijjā, Saṅkhāra...etc, in the three periods of Past-Future-Present and

2. penetrative realization by oneself of the causal relationships between the Causes such as Avijjā and the Effects such as Saṅkhāra are called Anubodha realization.

Penetrative realization by oneself of the Anicca, Dukkha and Anatta characteristics of the Paṭicca Samuppāda factors until the attainment of Magga Phala is Paṭivedha realization.
Without realising the Paṭicca Samuppāda by oneself penetratively, as they really are, by means of the two realizations of Anubodha and Paṭivedha then one cannot overcome and escape from the rounds of Saṁsāra.
Only if one realises them then one can overcome and escape from the rounds of Saṁsāra.

**Brief Notes On The 5th Method**

_Atīte hetavo pañca, idāni phalapañcakaṁ_

_Idāni hetavo pañca, āyati phalapañcakaṁ_

According to the above Commentary, the meditator must discern to realise that:

1. because of the 5 past causes Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra-Kamma, the 5 present effects Viññāṇa-NāmaRūpa-Saḷāyatana-Phassa-Vedanā arise and

2. because of the 5 present causes Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra-Kamma, the 5 future effects Viññāṇa-NāmaRūpa-Saḷāyatana-Phassa-Vedanā arise.

In this case the causes are Samudaya Saccā and the effects are Dukkha Sacca group.
Therefore the meditator must meditate to realise penetratively by oneself that:

1. Because of Samudaya Sacca in the past life, Dukkha Sacca arises in present life.

2. Because of present life Samudaya Sacca, Dukkha Sacca arises in the future life.

**Samudaya Saccā**

The Buddha taught on Samudaya Sacca in 5 ways in Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga Pāḷi which are:

1. Taṇhā is Samudaya Saccā

2. All Kilesa together with Taṇhā are Samudaya Sacca

3. All Akusala dhamma are Samudaya Sacca

4. All Akusala dhamma and Alobha, Adosa, Amoha = the 3 Kusala Mūla dhamma which Āsava takes as object and which can produce Saṁsāra Vaṭṭa are Samudaya Sacca

5. All Akusala Kamma and all Kusala Kamma which are the object of Āsava and which can produce Saṁsāra Vaṭṭa are Samudaya Sacca.

Therefore the Sammoha Vinodanī commentary mentioned - Tattha yasmā kusalākusalakammam avisesena samudaya saccanti sacca vibhaṅge vuttaṁ - that all Kusala Kamma and Akusala Kamma are Samudaya Sacca.
Furthermore in Aṅguttara Pāḷi Tika Nipata taught that all the factors of Paṭicca Samuppāda causal relationships are Samudaya Sacca - Katamañca bhikkhave dukkhasamudayaṁ ariyasaccaṁ.
Avijjāpaccayā Saṅkhārā, Saṅkhārapaccayā Viññāṅaṁ, Viññāṅapaccayā NāmaRūpaṁ, NāmaRūpapaccayā Saḷāyatanaṁ, Saḷāyatanapaccayā Phasso, Phassapaccayā Vedanā, Vedanāpaccayā Taṇhā, Taṇhāpaccayā Upādānaṁ, Upādānapaccayā Bhavo, Bhavapaccayā Jāti, Jātipaccayā JarāMaraṇa-Soka Parideva-Dukkha-Domanassupāyāsā sambhavanti.
Evametassa kevalassa Dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti.
Idaṁ vuccati bhikkhave dukkhasamudayaṁ ariyasaccam.
(Aṅguttara Nikāya-Vol.1-178, Burmese script).

In Sacca Saṁyutta, Kūṭāgāra Sutta, it is taught that if one does not realise the Four Noble Truths by insight penetratively then there is no means to end the Saṁsāra Vaṭṭa rounds of suffering; but only if one realises the Four Noble Truths by his own insight penetratively then one can end the Saṁsāra Vaṭṭa rounds of suffering.

Therefore the meditator who wants to end the Saṁsāra Vaṭṭa rounds of suffering must strive to realise the Four Noble Truths by insight penetratively.
Do not forget that among the Four Noble Truths, Samudaya Sacca is included.

**Taṇhā Of Which Period?**

The Buddha taught that Taṇhā is Samudaya Saccā; one should investigate and reflect as to which period did Taṇhā, the fundamental cause of the present life Dukkha Sacca called Samudaya Saccā arise.

Rūpārūpaṁ pañcakkhandhā, taṁ hoti dukkhasaccaṁ, taṁ samuṭṭhāpikā purimataṇhā samudayasaccaṁ (Abhidhamma Commentary-Vol.2-68,69 Burmese script) - Rūpa+Nāma are the 5 Khandhā.
That 5 Khandhā are Dukkha Saccā.
Taṇhā accumulated in previous life which can produce the Dukkha Saccā is Samudaya Saccā.
This is what the above commentary means.

According to the teaching of the above commentary, one must understand that the Taṇhā called Samudaya Saccā, which is the fundamental cause of the 5 Khandhā/Dukkha Saccā in the present life meditator, is not the Taṇhā that arises in the present life.
It is only the Taṇhā that was accumulated in previous life.

**A Teaching In Paṭisambhidā Magga**

Purimakammabhavasmiṁ moho avijjā, āyūhanā saṅkhārā, nikanti taṇhā, upagamanaṁ upādānaṁ, cetanā bhavo.
Ime pañca dhammā purimakammabhavasmiṁ idha paṭisandhiyā paccayā (Paṭisambhida, 50 Burmese script) - the Moha, wrong knowing that arose in the past life of accumulating the Kamma called Kamma Bhava is Avijjā.
Striving for the arising of Kamma is Saṅkhāra.
Nikanti, the craving for states of existence and objects is Taṇhā.
Clinging to states of existence and objects is Upādāna.
Kusala Cetanā or Akusala Cetanā is Bhava.
These 5 dhamma which arose in the previous life when accumulating the Kamma called Kamma Bhava are the causes of Paṭisandhi in the present life ( i.e.
Paṭisandhi 5 Khandhā for human beings).

What the Paṭisambhidā Pāḷi means is that when accumulating Kamma Bhava, the Kamma that was being surrounded by Avijjā, Taṇhā and Upādāna which arose in the past life is the real cause of Vipāka Khandhā, such as present life Paṭisandhi 5 Khandhā.
Take note that the Kamma is Samudaya Sacca.

Therefore the meditator must discern to realise penetratively by oneself that because of the Kamma called Samudaya Sacca in the past life, the Dukkha Saccā such as Paṭisandhi 5 Khandhā in the present life arises.
Only then one will realise penetratively by oneself that because of Samudaya Sacca, Dukkha Sacca arises.

**Saṅkhāra And Kamma Bhava**

1. In the accumulation of Dāna deeds, the (Pubba) Cetanā that arises before giving is Saṅkhāra.
   The Patiṭṭhāpaka Cetanā (= Muñca Cetanā) that arises when offering the object into the hands of the recipient is Kamma Bhava.

2. In another way, in the Manodvārika Javana Vīthi mind processes that are arising while accumulating the Kamma, the Cetanās in the first 6 Javanas among the 7 Javanas are called Āyūhana Saṅkhāra.
   The 7th Javana Cetanā is called Kamma Bhava.

3. In another way, the Cetanā in the Javana Cittuppāda while accumulating a Kamma is Kamma Bhava.
   The Citta Cetasika group accompanying with the Cetanā are called Āyuhana Saṅkhāra.

Therefore one can understand that the Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra-Kamma which are being accumulated in the present life are not the causes, Samudaya Saccā, of the present life 5 Khandhā, Dukkha Sacca.

If one considers mainly the Kamma out of those 5 causes, then one may agree satisfactorily that only because of the Samudaya Saccā in the past life, Dukkha Saccā arises in this present life.
If one does not agree that because of the Kamma called Samudaya Sacca done and accumulated in the past life, the Dukkha Saccā such as Paṭisandhi 5 Khandhā in the present life arises then one must further consider whether it is necessary to fulfil the Pāramī for as long as 4 Asaṅkkheyya and 1 lakh Kappa for Sammā Sambodhi; for as long as 2 Asaṅkkheyya and 1 lakh Kappa for Paccekabodhi; for as long as 1 Asaṅkkheyya and 1 lakh Kappa for Agga Sāvakabodhi; and for as long as 1 lakh Kappa for Mahā Sāvakabodhi.

**Anumāna And Paccakkha**

If: (1) the meditator accepts that the past and future can only be discerned by means of inference or guessing (Anumāna) because he thinks that the past no longer exist as it had already perished away and that the future has not occur yet; and

(2) he also accepts that &#39;because of the 5 past causes, the 5 present effects arise&#39; and &#39;because of the 5 present causes, the 5 future effects arise&#39; can be discerned only by means of inference (Anumāna),

then it means that the Ariya person can know that &#39;because of Samudaya Saccā, Dukkha Saccā arises&#39; by means of inference only.

However, in both the teachings of the Buddha and the commentary it is taught that Dukkha Saccā and Samudaya Sacca are known distinctively as they really are:

Idaṁ dukkhanti yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti.
Ayaṁ dukkha samudayoti yathābhūtam pajānāti (Majjhima Nikāya-Vol.1-85 Burmese script).

&quot;Ayaṁ lokīyo ayaṁ lokuttaro&quot;ti ariyaṁ aṭṭhaṅgīkaṁ maggaṁ yathābhutaṁ na pajānāti ajānanto lokiyamagge abhinivisitvā lokuttaraṁ nibbattetuṁ na sakkāti (Majjhima commentary-Vol.2-165).

-   Only when one realises by oneself penetratively, as they really are, the Dukkha Saccā and Samudaya Saccā; and that because of Samudaya Saccā, Dukkha Saccā arises then one can develop the Magga Sacca, that is one can meditate Vipassanā on the Three Characteristics of Dukkha Saccā and Samudaya Saccā.
    Only if one develops the Lokiya Magga Sacca then one can attain the Lokuttarā Magga Saccā and Lokuttarā Nirodha Saccā.
    Therefore take note that it is unavoidable to discern the past and future to realise Paṭicca Samuppāda, causal relationships as they really are.

**Attaining Paccayapariggaha Ñāṇa**

Vipassakena pana kammantarañca vipākantarañca ekadesato jānitabbaṁ.
(Visuddhimagga)

Ekadesato jānitabbaṁ anavasesato jānituṁ na sakkā avisayattā.
Sabbena sabbaṁ ajānate paccayapariggaho na paripūrati.
(Mahā Ṭīka-Vol.2-380)

-   it means that the Vipassaka person who is practising Vipassanā meditation should realise some of the Kamma and their effects among the diverse different Kamma and their effects.
    As it is not the scope of Sāvaka (disciples of the Buddha) to know all of the Kamma and their effects totally but is only the scope of Buddha&#39;s Omniscience (Sabbaññutā), one is not able to know totally.
    However, if one does not realise any of the Kamma and its effect, then the insight knowledge of Paccaya Pariggaha Ñāṇa cannot be fulfilled.
    This is what the above means.

As PaccayaPariggaha Ñāṇa cannot be attained if one does not realise the Kamma and its Effect dhamma, one must strive to realise them (Kamma and its effect) to some extent for the attainment of PaccayaPariggaha Ñāṇa.

As you may have already known, there are twelve Vipāka (effects of Kamma) of Buddha.
(For example, having intense back pain, being wrongly accused by Ciñca, being wounded by a splinter from a rock hurled by Devadatta....etc).
In this case, there are individual Kamma which produce their respective effect (Vipāka).
Similarly it is natural that a human being throughout his life is experiencing various pleasant objects (iṭṭhārammaṇa) and unpleasant objects (aniṭṭhārammaṇa) which are the good Effects and bad Effects.
Experiencing pleasant objects are because of Kusala Kamma.
Experiencing unpleasant objects are because of Akusala Kamma.
As there are various respective Kusala Kamma for the various pleasant objects, there are also various respective Akusala Kamma for the various unpleasant objects.
A Sāvaka cannot realise all of these Kamma and their Effects totally; but one can realise some of them only.

**Abhiññā And Vipassanā**

One can accept that past lives can be discerned by Pubbenivāsānussati Abhiññā and that future lives can be discerned by Anāgataṁsa ñāṇa which is a section of Dibba Cakkhu; but one may be reluctant to accept that the pasts and futures Khandhas can be discerned by Vipassanā insight.
The teachings of the Buddha and the explanations of the Commentary that past and future Upādānakkhandhā can be discerned by Vipassanā insight are as follows:

_Ye hi keci bhikkhave samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā anekavihitaṁ pubbenivāsaṁ anussaramānā anussaranti, sabbete pañcupādānakkhandhe anussaranti etesaṁ vā aññataraṁ.
Katame pañca?_

_&quot;Evaṁ rūpo ahosiṁ atītamaddhāna&quot;nti, iti vā hi bhikkhave anussaramāno rūpaṁ yeva anussarati...Evaṁ vedano...Evaṁ sañño...Evaṁ saṅkhāro...Evaṁ viññāṇo..._

(Saṁyutta Nikāya-Vol.2-71 Burmese script)(Khajjaniya Sutta)

_Pubbenivāsanti na idaṁ abhiññāvasena anussaraṇaṁ sandhāya vuttaṁ, Vipassanāvasena pana pubbenivāsaṁ anussarante samaṇabrahmaṇe sandhāyesaṁ vuttaṁ.
Tenevāha....&quot;sabbete pañcupādānakkhandhe anussaranti etesaṁ vā aññatara&quot;nti.
Abhiññāvasena hi samanussarantassa khandhāpi upādānakkhandhāpi khandhapaṭibaddhāpi paṇṇattipi ārammaṇaṁ hotiyeva.
Rūpaṁ yeva anussaratīti evaṁ anussaranto na aññaṁ kiñci sattaṁ vā puggalaṁ vā anussarati, atīte pana niruddhaṁ rūpakkhandhameva anussarati.
Vedanādīsupi esevanayoti._ (Saṁyutta Commentary-Vol.2-266 Burmese script).

&quot;Bhikkhus, there are some Samaṇas and some Brahmaṇas who, recollecting by insight the numerous past existences&#39; Khandha processes can discern them.
Such Samaṇas and Brahmaṇas can recollect by insight the 5 Upādāna Khandhā or one the 5&quot; (Khajjaniya Sutta).

In the above Pāḷi, by using the word &quot;Pubbenivāsaṁ&quot; the Buddha did not mean that it is the recollection of past existence Khandhā process by the power of Pubbenivāsānussati Abhiññā.
What the Buddha really meant by the word &quot;Pubbenivāsaṁ&quot; is that the Samaṇas and Brahmaṇas recollect the past existence Khandhā processes by the power of Vipassanā insight.
Therefore the Buddha taught it as &quot;sabbete pañcupādānakkhandhe anussaranti etesaṁ vā aññataraṁ...&quot; - &quot;...these Samaṇas and Brahmaṇas can recollect the 5 Upādānakkhandhā by insight.
They can also recollect one of these 5 by insight...&quot;

The reason is that there are only 4 objects of Pubbenivāsānussati Abhiññā which are:

1. 5 Khandhā that includes Lokuttarā dhamma,

2. 5 Upādānakkhandhā that does not include Lokuttarā dhamma,

3. Clan, complexion, food nutriment, happiness, suffering...etc connected with the 5 Khandhā,

4. Various name concepts.

In the above Pali Text, as the Buddha was not teaching about the discernment of these 4 objects by insight but was teaching only the discernment of the past 5 Upādānakkhandhā or one of them by insight, it can be understood that the Buddha only meant the discernment of past Khandhā by Vipassanā ñāṇa and not by Pubbenivāsānussati Abhiññā.
In discerning the past Khandhā process by Vipassanā ñāṇa, it is not discerning &#39;beings&#39;, &#39;persons&#39; but discerns by insight only the Rūpa, Vedanā, Saññā, Saṅkhāra &amp; Viññāṇa which had ceased in the past life.

(Saṁyutta-Vol.2-71; Samyutta Commentary-Vol.2-266 Burmese script)

The above are the references about the difference in power between Pubbenivāsānussati Abhiññā and Vipassanā ñāṇa and that the past and future can be discerned by Vipassanā ñāṇa.

**The Technique To Search For The Cause**

Paccayasamuppanne hi apariggahite paccayapariggaho na sakkā hoti kātuṁ.
Tasmā dhammaṭṭhitiñāṇaggahaṇeneva tassa hetubhūtaṁ pubbe siddhaṁ nāmarūpavavatthānañāṇaṁ vuttameva hotīti veditabbaṁ.
(Paṭisambhida Commentary-Vol.1-18)

-   According to the above definition of Paṭisambhida Magga Commentary, the meditator who would like to discern = distinguish the causes by insight = Paccaya Pariggaha must firstly strive to be able to attain the NāmaRūpa Vavatthāna ñāṇa, that is to distinguish = discern the effects NāmaRūpa called Paccayasamuppanna.

What it means is that the meditator who wants to distinguish and discern the past causes by insight must already distinguished and discerned the present NāmaRūpa called Paccayuppannadhamma which arise because of past cause; and the past NāmaRūpa called Paccayuppannadhamma which were dependent upon a farther past cause (i.e., which arose because of the respective farther past cause).
Furthermore, if the meditator wants to discern and distinguish that &#39;because of the present 5 causes, the future 5 effects called Paccayuppannadhamma arise&#39;, then he must already discerned and distinguished by insight the present NāmaRūpa called Paccayuppannadhamma which the present causes Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra-Kamma are dependent upon; and the future 5 effects called Paccayuppannadhamma which will arise because of those present causes.
Only then can the meditator search for the past causes easily and can discern that because of the past causes, present effects arise.
Similarly &#39;the arising of future effects is because of present causes&#39; can also be distinguished and discerned by insight.
Understand that the way is the same for the successive pasts and successive futures.

Therefore the meditator must firstly take note of the fact that before discerning &#39;because of the cause, the effect arises&#39;, he must already discerned the past 5 Khandhā, present 5 Khandhā and future 5 Khandhā.

**Four Ways Of Teaching Paṭicca Samuppāda**

The Visuddhimagga (Vism., XVII, 28) and Sammoha Vinodanī-Paṭicca Samuppāda Vibhaṅga (Abhidhamma Commentary-Vol.2-124,125 Burmese script) mentioned about the 4 ways of teaching Paṭicca Samuppāda with similes of men gathering creepers.

1. It is taught by means of Anuloma Paṭicca Samuppāda method which is teaching from &#39;because of Avijjā, Saṅkhāra arise&#39; until &#39;because of Jāti, JarāMaraṇa arise&#39; = from the beginning until the end.

2. It is taught beginning from the middle Vedanā until the arising of Jāti produced by Bhava = from the middle till the end.

3. It is taught beginning from &#39;the arising of JarāMaraṇa because of the cause, Jāti&#39; until &#39;the arising of Saṅkhāra because of the cause, Avijjā&#39; = from the end until the beginning in reverse order, i.e.
   Paṭiloma Paṭicca Samuppāda method.

4. It is taught as &#39;the 4 Āhāra arise because of Taṇhā; Taṇhā arise because of Avijjā&#39;...etc, until &#39;Saṅkhāra arises because of Avijjā&#39; = from the middle until the beginning.

5. Mentioned in the Commentary as &quot;Atīte hetavo pañca, idāni phala pañcakaṁ...etc&quot;, it is taught as:

(A) &#39;Because of 5 past causes, 5 present effects arise&#39;,

(B) &#39;Because of 5 present causes, 5 future effects arise&#39;.

The meditator can search for the causes or causes and their effects by any one of the 5 Paṭicca Samuppāda methods which he prefers.
Among these 5 methods, the 5th method of discerning the causal relationships between causes and effects is mainly shown in this booklet.
At the beginning stage of searching for the cause, the method from the middle to the beginning is used.

In accordance with the teachings of Paṭisambhida Magga commentary of searching for the causes from the middle to the beginning like that, it is found that it is easier for many meditators if they are firstly able to discern the successive 5 Khandhā from the present 5 Khandhā until the past 5 Khandhā.
Therefore, firstly discern from the present 5 Khandhā until the past 5 Khandhā.
In discerning like that it is based on the method of discerning past 5 Khandhā successively in the Pubbenivāsānussati section of Visuddhimagga.
When able to discern the successive 5 Khandhā till the past 5 Khandhā the meditator must further discern to realise by insight that &#39;because of the 5 past causes which arose dependent upon farther past 5 Khandhā, the present 5 Khandhā arises.&#39; If able to discern and link the cause and effect successfully by the Paṭicca Samuppāda 5th method, then the remaining other methods can be easily understood.

**Sending The Mind = The Insight Towards The Past**

Firstly establish the concentration progressively.
Discern the NāmaRūpa existing internally and externally alternately.
Discern especially beginning from the NāmaRūpa in the 6th line towards the past.
Most of the meditators are successful in this method.

The discernment of past NāmaRūpa beginning from the NāmaRūpa that arose in the most recent posture just occurred and the discernment of causal relationships will be further mentioned.

After having offered lights or water or flowers to the Buddha, just before the sitting meditation, make an aspiration for Nibbāna.
Then make an aspiration for a life (state of existence), such as life as monk or as a woman which one likes if one has to go round the Saṁsāra before attaining Nibbāna.
Notice and remember the mind processes that arise while making the aspiration.

After that, sitting in meditation, establish the concentration progressively and then discern NāmaRūpa internally and externally; especially discern mainly the wholesome Nāma group in Dhammārammaṇa line.
If the meditator is especially a Samatha Yanika person then discern mainly the Jhāna Nāma dhamma.
When the light becomes very powerful try to discern the Nāma dhamma in the mental process of the period in making the aspiration for monk life or woman life; and the Nāma dhamma in the mental process of the period in making the aspiration for attainment of Nibbāna after having offered lights or water or flowers to the Buddha in the most recent posture just before sitting meditation.

To discern these Nāma, firstly discern the Hadaya Vatthu together with the 54 types of Rūpa that exist in hadaya which the Nāma are dependent upon.
Then discern the host Bhavaṅga Citta that arise dependent upon the Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa.
After having discerned the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element then discern forward and backwards of the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element to discern the Nāma called Vīthi mind process that arose in between Bhavaṅga Mind Clearness.
When able to discern these Nāma, examine precisely whether they are the same with the mind processes of making the aspiration just before the sitting meditation.
If they are the same then one is able to discern the nearest past NāmaRūpa.

**If One Is A Samatha Yānika Person**

If the meditator is a Samatha Yānika person and aspires for Brahmā life then he must practise the Jhāna which can bring him to reach (i.e.
rebirth in) the Brahmā realm which he likes.
For example, if that Jhāna is 4th Jhāna then enter into the 4th Jhāna again.
Either before or after entering into that Jhāna, make an aspiration for the Brahmā life; or else incline the mind (towards life as Brahmā).
Making an aspiration or mental inclination is accumulating Kilesa Vaṭṭa where Avijjā, Taṇhā and Upādāna are predominant.
Entering into the Jhāna for many times is accumulating Kamma Vaṭṭa which are Saṅkhāra and Kamma.

Then discern again that Kilesa Vaṭṭa Nāma group, Kamma Vaṭṭa Nāma group and the Basis Vatthu Rūpa where these Nāma are dependent upon.
If able to discern those NāmaRūpa then the meditator is successful in discerning the nearest past NāmaRūpa.
In discerning the past NāmaRūpa like that, discern mainly the Basis Vatthu Rūpa on the side of &#39;Rūpa&#39; and Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element on the side of Nāma.

**Kilesa Vaṭṭa And Kamma Vaṭṭa**

The Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra-Kamma mentioned above which can produce the rounds of Saṁsāra Vaṭṭa will be further explained.
In the above 1st example of making an aspiration:

1. Avijjā = wrong knowing as &#39;monk&#39; or &#39;woman&#39; = 20 (Nāma dhamma)

2. Taṇhā = attachment to monk life or woman life = 20

3. Upādāna = clinging to monk life or woman life = 20

(&#39;20&#39; here refers to the Lobha+Diṭṭhi group.
It can be 19 or 22 or 21 accordingly)

4. Saṅkhāra = the Kusala Cetanā group (i.e.
   Saddhā-Paññā group = 34) of offering lights or water or flowers to the Buddha

5. Kamma = Kamma Satti force of that 34.
   The Avijjā, Taṇhā and Upādāna called Kilesa Vaṭṭa mostly arise as:

Manodvārāvajjana-7 times Javana.
If Kāma objects such as Rūpārammaṇa of monk life or woman life is taken as object, then Tadārammaṇa can arise.
The Javana is of Lobha-Diṭṭhi group =20.
As for Kamma Vaṭṭa which are Saṅkhāra and Kamma, they are the Saddhā-Paññā group Manodvārika Javana Vīthi mind process.
If ñāṇa and pīti accompany with Javana then it is 34. As this Kusala Cetanā group is Anicca dhamma, they ceased when their life-span as arising-static-perishing is ended.
However they perished away only after embedding the Kamma Satti force in the NāmaRūpa process which can produce the monk life or woman life that one aspires to be in a future life.
They are not like Vipāka Nāma and Kiriyā Nāma which perish away without leaving any Satti force.
That Kamma Satti force is called Kamma.
It is Nānākkhaṇika Kamma Satti.

**2nd Example Of Aspiration**

In making an aspiration for Brahmā life:

1. Avijjā = wrong knowing as &#39;Brahmā&#39; = 20

2. Taṇhā = attachment to Brahmā life = 20

3. Upādāna = clinging to Brahmā life = 20

4. Saṅkhāra = Having aspired for Brahmā life, it is the 4th Jhāna Kusala Cetanā which is done and accumulated = 31

5. Kamma = Kamma Satti force of that Saṅkhāra (31).

In this case, in the Kilesa Vaṭṭa which are Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna it is the Lobha-Diṭṭhi group = 20.
In Saṅkhāra, it is the 4th Jhāna Nāma dhamma = 31. They are Manodvārika Javana Vīthi mind processes only.

If the meditator can discern by insight the Nāma that has arose in the most recent posture called Kilesa Vaṭṭa and Kamma Vaṭṭa, having removed their Nāma compactness until attaining ultimate reality of Nāma then the discernment of the nearest past NāmaRūpa has been successful.

**If The Appearance Appears**

While discerning the NāmaRūpa that arose in the nearest past posture by shining the light produced by the insight which was discerning NāmaRūpa internally and externally, if the appearance of making the aspiration before sitting meditation appears then discern the 4 Great Elements of that appearance.
It will then become small particles Rūpa Kalāpa.
Having analysed those Rūpa Kalāpa, discern all the Rūpa in the 6 sense bases, 42 Koṭṭhāsa as a whole.
Discern especially the 54 types of Rūpa in Hadaya (= in the heart).
Discern mainly the Basis Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa.
Further discern the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element.
Then discern the Nāma dhamma processes which arise in between Bhavaṅga Mind Clearness, being dependent upon the Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa.
Examine to see whether the Nāma processes discerned are the same as the Nāma dhamma processes that arose at the time of making the aspiration.
If they are the same then the discernment of the nearest past NāmaRūpa is successful.
If successful like that, then sending the insight towards the past gradually discern the past NāmaRūpa successively such as yesterday NāmaRūpa, the day before yesterday NāmaRūpa, last month NāmaRūpa, last year NāmaRūpa...etc.
In discerning like that, if appearances appear at random, discern the 4 Great Elements on them and further discern the NāmaRūpa as mentioned above.
Continue to discern the NāmaRūpa until the time of the 1st stage of foetus formation (Kalalarūpa) in the mother&#39;s womb.

**Towards Maraṇāsanna In The Past**

At the time of Paṭisandhi 1st stage foetus formation of human beings, there arise 3 types of Rūpa Kalāpa: Hadaya Dasaka Kalāpa, Kāya Dasaka Kalāpa and Bhāva Dasaka Kalāpa or 30 types of Rūpa.
(Although there are only 3 types of Rūpa Kalāpa or 30 types of Rūpa, the quantity of each type are many).
As for the Nāma, if one is a Tihetuka person whose Paṭisandhi is accompanied with Somanassa Vedanā then it is the Saddhā-Paññā group 34 (Nāma dhamma).
Discern these NāmaRūpa until the insight is clear.
Being able to discern until attaining ultimate reality (paramattha) with clear insight, one investigates and reflects in this way:

So &quot;idaṁ nāmarūpaṁ na ahetu na appaccayā nibbattam, sahetu sappaccayā nibbattam.
Ko panassa hetu, ko pana paccayo&quot;ti upaparikkhanto &quot;Avijjāpaccayā taṇhā paccayā kammapaccayā āhārapaccayā cā&quot;ti tassa paccayaṁ vavatthapetvā &quot;atītepi paccayā ceva paccayasamuppannadhammā ca, anāgatepi etarahipi paccayā ceva paccayasamuppannadhammā ca, tato uddhaṁ satto vā puggalo vā natthi, suddhasaṅkhārapuñjā evā&quot;ti tīsu addhāsu kaṅkhaṁ viharati.
Ayaṁ pana vipassanāsaṅkhārasallakkhaṇā ñātapariññā nāma.

(Abhidhamma Commentary-Vol.2-241,242 Burmese script)

-   according to the above commentary, if one investigates and reflects that, &quot;These NāmaRūpa do not arise without both the Hetu cause = Janaka cause which produces (the effect) directly and the supporting Paccaya cause = Upatthambhaka cause; they arise only if there exist Hetu cause = Janaka cause which produces directly and Paccaya cause = Upatthambhaka cause which supports.
    What are their Hetu cause = Janaka cause and Paccaya cause = Upatthambhaka cause?&quot; then having sent the light of insight towards the past, one can begin to find either the NāmaRūpa that arose while on the verge of death = Maraṇāsanna in the past life or the object (being either Kamma object or Kamma Nimitta object or Gati Nimitta object) of that Maraṇāsanna Javana.

If one is able to discern the NāmaRūpa of the Maraṇāsanna period then it is very sure to find one of these three: Kamma or Kamma Nimitta or Gati Nimitta which was the object of the Nāma dhamma group called Maraṇāsanna Javana.
It is no longer difficult.
That Nimitta appeared because of the force (Satti) of the Kamma which is going to produce the effect.
Therefore if one can find that Nimitta then it is sure that he can find the Saṅkhāra and Kamma which are the causes of some Vipāka Khandhā such as the present life Paṭisandhi 5 Khandhā.
If Saṅkhāra and Kamma are found, further discern the Avijja-Taṇhā-Upādāna which &#39;surround&#39; that Saṅkhāra and Kamma.

If the meditator does not find the NāmaRūpa of Maraṇāsanna when investigating and reflecting by insight towards the past and if sees only the appearance of being dead then discern the 4 Great Elements of that corpse.
Then he will find only small particles.
Analyse these small particles.
Mostly, one will find the groups of Rūpa where Ojā is the 8th and which are produced by Tejo dhātu called Utujaojatthamaka Rūpa.

It is mentioned as &#39;mostly&#39; because sometimes a meditator may find the Rūpa Kalāpa of some living maggots existing in that corpse.
Therefore, sometimes a meditator may find Transparent Kalāpa and Non-transparent Kalāpa mixed together in the corpse.
However, that of the corpse, there are only Utuja Rūpa which are Non-transparent Utuja Rūpa.

After having discerned the Rūpa of that corpse, further discern towards the past gradually to discern the NāmaRūpa that arose at the time of near death.
If able to discern the NāmaRūpa of near death, then discern the object of the Maraṇāsanna Javana which was arising at the time of near death.
If not successful then discern to be able to &#39;catch&#39; the Hadaya Vatthu of the time near death.
After that further discern the host Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element which arise dependent upon that Hadaya Vatthu.
When able to discern the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element, then discerning the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element forwards and backwards, earlier before death and on the verge of dying, the meditator can find and can discern the object of the Maraṇāsanna Javana in that Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element which is either Kamma or Kamma Nimitta or Gati Nimitta.
According to the experiences of the meditators here, either Kamma or Kamma Nimitta appeared to many meditators; very few of the meditators have Gati Nimitta appeared.
This is according to the experiences of the meditators who are searching for the past causes, meditating in Pa Auk only.

If that Maraṇāsanna (= near death) Nimitta is a Kamma object Nimitta which is arising as though one is doing the Kusala Wholesome deed again -- mentioned as Abhinavakaraṇavasena in Abhidhammattha Sangaha -- then the meditator must further discern the NāmaRūpa which arose at the time of doing that Kusala deed.

The discernment:- Discern the 4 Great Elements of the appearance which is doing the wholesome Kusala deed.
If the Rūpa Kalāpas are seen, then analyse them until attainment of Rūpa Paramattha.
Especially discern mainly the 54 types of Rūpa which are together with Hadaya Vatthu in the heart which arose at the time of doing that wholesome Kusala deed.
After that discern the Hadaya Vatthu.
Further discern the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element which arise dependent upon that Hadaya Vatthu.
Then discern the Nāma group which were arising in-between Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Elements, at the time of doing the wholesome Kusala deed.
Discern to see by insight exactly what kind of Kusala wholesome deed was being done and what kind of Kusala Citta = Manodvārika Kusala Javana Vīthi mind processes were arising.
If discern forward and backward for many times then one will find the Kusala Javana Vīthi mind processes which were arising then and the Avijja-Taṇhā-Upādāna group by which one aimed and aspired in doing the wholesome Kusala.
In other words, the meditator found the Kusala Saṅkhāra &amp; Kamma which is &#39;surrounded&#39; with Avijjā, Taṇhā and Upādāna.

(NOTES: As the Saṅkhāra &amp; Kamma which can produce human state of existence is Kusala Saṅkhāra &amp; Kamma only, take note that only Kusala Saṅkhāra &amp; Kamma is mentioned as an example like that.)

**Past Aspiration Of Princess Sumana**

For better understanding of Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra-Kamma, the past aspiration of the famous Princess Sumana who is the daughter of King Kosala will be mentioned.
During the time of Vipassi Buddha, after she had offered a kind of flower called Sumana and milk rice to Vipassi Buddha together with the Saṁghā she made this aspiration: &quot;Bhavābhavābhinibbattiyaṁ me sati paritassanajīvitaṁ nāma mā hotu, ayaṁ sumanamālā viya nibbattanibbattaṭṭhāne piyāva homi nāmena ca sumanāyeva&quot; - &quot;In whatever life I may reborn, may my living be without worry.
In whatever life I may reborn, may I be the one (i.e.
a woman) whom others love like that flower and may I be called Sumana&quot; (Aṅguttara Commentary-Vol.3-13,14 Burmese script).

In the above wholesome deed and aspiration, both Kilesa Vaṭṭa and Kamma Vaṭṭa are included which are:

1. Avijjā = wrong knowing as a &quot;woman&quot; whose living is without worry, whom others love and called Sumana,

2. Taṇhā = attachment to that woman life,

3. Upādāna = clinging to that woman life,

4. Saṅkhāra = Kusala Cetanā group of offering flowers and milk rice to the Samghā lead by Vipassi Buddha,

5. Kamma = Kamma Satti force of that Kusala Cetanā group.

These 5 causes are the causes of some Vipāka Khandhā such as Paṭisandhi 5 Khandhā of the daughter of King Kosala named Princess Sumana.

**An Example Of A Meditator**

To understand better about it, an example of a meditator will be shown.
When she discerned the time of being on the verge of death, Maraṇāsanna in the past life she found the Kamma object Nimitta of offering fruits to a Bhikkhu appeared in the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element of the time near death in that past life.
After having discerned the 4 Great Elements on the appearance of offering fruits, when she further discern the NāmaRūpa she found the mind processes of making the aspiration to be a well educated city woman (being unhappy with the state of existence as a poor uneducated village woman then) and the mind processes of the Kusala Cetanā group in offering fruits.
These are:

1. Avijjā (20) = wrong knowing as &#39;well educated city woman&#39;,

2. Taṇhā (20) = attachment to that woman life,

3. Upādāna (20) = clinging to that woman life,

4. Saṅkhāra (34) = Kusala Cetanā group of offering,

5. Kamma = the Kamma Satti force of that 34.
   In this case, &#39;20&#39; is the 20 Nāma dhamma of Lobha-diṭṭhi group existing in each Javana of the Kilesa Vatta Manodvārika Javana Vīthi.
   As for &#39;34&#39;, it is the Saddhā-Paññā group Nāma dhamma existing in each Javana of the Manodvārika Kusala Javana Vīthi in offering the fruits.

In this life this meditator becomes a well educated city woman.
When discerned the causal relationships between causes and effects the meditator realised herself by insight that the Satti force of that Kusala Kamma in offering fruits produced many Vipāka Khandhā such as present life Paṭisandhi Vipāka 5 Khandhā...etc.
The insight which realises penetratively the causal relationships between causes and effects like that is PaccayaPariggaha = the insight which discerns the causes.
To understand more clearly see the following example also.

**Another Example**

When discerning the object of the near death moment, Maraṇāsanna Javana, in the past life, let&#39;s say that if the Kamma object of offering food at a pagoda (cetiya) appears, then after having discerned the 4 Great Elements on that appearance of offering food, further discern the NāmaRūpa.
Discern especially the Hadaya Vatthu and Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element.
Having discerned the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element backward and forward between the period of Maraṇāsanna Javana and the period before it, discern the Manodvārika Javana Vithi mind processes which arose in between these Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Elements.
Search to be able to find the mind processes of making an aspiration and the mind processes of offering food.
Discern them.
The meditator must be able to find the Kilesa Vaṭṭa (which are Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna) and Kamma Vaṭṭa (which is Saṅkhāra and Kamma) in these mind processes.

As an example, let&#39;s say that the meditator made the aspiration that, &quot;May I become a monk who can attain Nibbāna&quot;.

**Three In Kilesa Vaṭṭa**

1. Wrong knowing as &#39;monk&#39; who can attain Nibbāna is Avijjā.

2. Attachment to monk life (who can attain Nibbāna) is Taṇhā.

3. Clinging to monk life (who can attain Nibbāna) is Upādāna.

These Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna are Kilesa Vaṭṭa.
These Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna called Kilesa Vaṭṭa cannot arise just by themselves only.
They can arise only when accompanied by associate Citta-cetasikas, the Sampayutta dhamma such as Phassa, Vedanā, Saññā, Cetanā, Viññāṇa etc in one mind moment.
They are mostly the 20 (Nāma dhamma) of Lobha-diṭṭhi group.
(If Pīti is not included then it is 19).
It can be Sasaṅkhārika or Asaṅkhārika accordingly.

According to the Vīthi mind process, it occurs mostly as:

Manodvāravajjana-Javana (7 times); Tadārammaṇa may or may not arise.

If one is attached to the NāmaRūpa of monk life which one aspired to become, then Tadārammaṇa can arise.
It occurs in each as:

1. In Manodvārāvajjana = 12 Citta-cetasika.

2. In Javana = mostly 20 Citta-cetasika (Lobha-diṭṭhi group).

3. If Tadārammaṇa arise then = 12 (Pīti is included).

In these Nāma:

1. the Vedanā is Vedanākkhandhā = aggregate of Vedanā,

2. the Saññā is Saññākkhandhā = aggregate of Saññā,

3. the remaining other Cetasikas are Saṅkhārakkhandhā = aggregate of Saṅkhāra,

4. the consciousness Viññāṇa is Viññāṇakkhandhā = aggregate of Viññāṇa.

These Nāma are the 4 Nāmakkhandhā.
The Basis Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa (of these Nāma) together with the 54 types of Rūpa in Hadaya are Rūpakkhandhā.
(Non-real Rūpas can be included accordingly).
If group them together, then

1. in Manodvārāvajjana there are 5 Khandhā,

2. in each Javana there are 5 Khandhā,

3. in each Tadārammaṇa there are 5 Khandhā.

(NOTES: As for Tadārammaṇa, Mahā Vipāka Tadārammaṇa and Ahetuka AkusalaVipāka/KusalaVipāka Tadārammaṇa can arise accordingly.
They can arise as 34 or 33...etc accordingly.
Here, only the Somanassa Santīraṇa Tadārammaṇa type is shown).

In discerning the Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna which are part of the past causes or which are the Kilesa Vaṭṭa that &#39;surrounded&#39; the Saṅkhāra and Kamma done and accumulated in the past, the meditator must be able to discern these 5 Khandhā rightly, removing each compactness (Ghana) of Rūpa and Nāma until attaining the insight of ultimate reality.
According to the stages of insight, it is NāmaRūpaPariccheda ñāṇa.

**Two In Kamma Vaṭṭa**

In offering food at the pagoda (= to the Buddha);

1. the Kusala Javana Vīthi can take the recipient, i.e.
   the Buddha as object,

2. the Kusala Javana Vīthi can take the things (=food) to be offered as object,

3. the subsequent Kusala Cetanā = Kusala Javana Vīthi can take the preceding Kusala Cetanā of offering.

Discern precisely as to what Kusala Javana Vīthi mind processes were arising while offering the food.
If those Kusala Javanas have Somanassa Vedanā and accompanied by ñāṇa, Ñāṇa Sampayutta, then there are 34 Citta-cetasikas.
These are of the Saddhā-Paññā group.
According to Vīthi mind process, they arise as: Manodvārāvajjana-Javana (7 times)-Tadārammaṇa (2 times).
Tadārammaṇa may or may not arise.

There are:

1. in Manodvrārāvajjana = 12 CittaCetasikas,

2. in each Javana = 34 CittaCetasikas,

3. in each Tadārammaṇa = 34 CittaCetasikas.

Each of these groups of Nāma dhammas are 4 Nāmakkhandhā.
The Rūpa dhammas existing in Hadaya where these Nāma are dependent upon are Rūpakkhandhā.
Therefore there are:

1. 5 Khandhā in Manodvārāvajjana,

2. 5 Khandhā in each Javana moment,

3. 5 Khandhā in each Tadārammaṇa moment.

The insight which is knowing, discerning and distinguishing these 5 Khandhā is NāmaRūpaPariccheda ñāṇa according to the stages of insight.
However these Kilesa Vaṭṭa 5 Khandhā and Kamma Vaṭṭa 5 Khandhā are the causes 5 Khandhā for the Vipāka 5 Khandhā of the present life (i.e.
monk life).

Among the above 5 Khandhā, the 34 Nāma dhammas in each Javana which are the &#39;forming&#39; dhamma (jyKjyif) so that the aspired monk life 5 Khandhā = NāmaRūpa come to arise is called Saṅkhāra.
They are the &#39;striving&#39; cause to produce a new state of existence.

As these Saṅkhāra are Anicca dhamma, they perished away after arising.
However, unlike Vipāka Khandhā, they perished away not without leaving any Satti force in the NāmaRūpa processes.
They perished away only after having embedded in the NāmaRūpa processes the Kamma Satti force which can produce 5 Khandhā in the future, in this case, the aspired monk life who can attain Nibbāna.
This Kamma Satti is the Kamma.

**Paccaya Pariggaha Stage**

If the meditator found the causes which are Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra- Kamma done and accumulated in the past, then he is to try to correlate that Kamma, which is the Kamma Satti force, with the 30 types of Kammaja Rūpa existing at the time of the 1st stage foetus formation, Paṭisandhi.
Discern to realise whether there is any causal relationship between Kamma and Kammaja Rūpa.
Just as there is causal relationship between mind and Cittaja Rūpa, discern precisely whether there is any causal relationships between Kamma and Kammaja Rūpa.

If there is causal relationship then the meditator must realise and see himself that the Kammaja Rūpa are arising successively because of that Kamma.
If there is no causal relationship = if the meditator does not find by insight that the arising of the Kammaja Rūpa is because of that Kamma then he has to search again for the effect-producing Kamma.
Search for it by discerning forward and backward the objects which were appearing in the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element at the time of near death.
The meditator will find the Kamma which produce the effect.

For some meditator, at the time of near death, 2 or 3 Kamma may appear in the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element one after another without a break (ra&amp;S; raESmif;).
The effect-producing Kammas were rushing/scrambling (to produce the effect)(tvkt,uf).
Just as groups of cattle are penned up together and when the gate of the cattles&#39; pen is opened early in the morning the cattles are scrambling and goring their way out, so for some persons the Kammas are scrambling at the time of near death.
Just as the strongest cattle near the gate of the pen comes out first by scrambling and goring at other cattle, so among the many Kammas appearing at the time of near death the strongest Kamma can produce the effect last (aemufqHk;tusdK;ay;cGihf); the Kamma which is going to produce the effect is the object of the last Maraṇāsanna Javana.
In other words, because of the power of the Kamma which is going to produce the effect, either one of the three: Kamma or Kamma Nimitta or Gati Nimmita is the object of Maraṇāsanna Javana.
In the case of many Kammas are arising like that at the time of near death, then after having been able to &#39;catch&#39; the object of Maraṇāsanna Javana the meditator must discern the Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra-Kamma in that object, as in the method mentioned above.

In the case of many Kammas appeared scrambling at the time of Maraṇāsanna, when one of them is the Janaka Kamma which produced the effect directly, then the other Kamma can be the Upatthambhaka Kamma which support that Janaka Kamma.
When trying to discern the object which was appearing in the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element at the time of near death in the past life, the meditator may have discerned the objects which were appearing in the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element before the occurrence of Maraṇāsanna Javana and therefore bypassed the object of Maraṇāsanna Javana.
If he happened to discern bypassing like that then he will find the Upatthambhaka Kamma = supporting Kamma first.
Then if he tries to discern whether there is any causal relationships between that Upatthambhaka Kamma and the Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa, then he will find that there is no causal relationship between them.
However if he were to find the Janaka Kamma (= the Kamma which produce the effect directly) first and if he discerns by insight whether there is any causal relationships between that Kamma and the Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa then he will find that there is causal relationships between them.

Therefore in searching for the past Kamma, it is possible that the meditator may find the Janaka Kamma first; or the Upatthambhaka Kamma first because he happened to bypassed (the Maraṇāsanna Javana).
Therefore, in discerning, the meditator must check and link again and again.
Be able to &#39;catch&#39; the object of Maraṇāsanna Javana precisely which arise last, being nearest to the Cuti Citta (i.e.
just before Cuti Citta).
As that Nimitta object appeared because of the power of the Kamma which is going to produce the effect, then in searching for the Kamma, it (which is either Kamma, Kamma Nimitta or Gati Nimitta) can be discerned precisely by checking and linking.

**Altering Of Nimitta**

The Kammas which appeared around the time of near death before Maraṇāsanna Javana can sometimes be changed according to Right Attention (Yoniso Manasikāra), Wrong Attention (Ayoniso Manasikāra), etc.
There was a monk who was the father of Venerable Arahant Soṇa.
After the appearing of Hell nimitta in his mind firstly, then as he changed it and was able to take the offering of flowers at a pagoda as object, the deity world Nimitta (female deity) appeared.
According to the incident of that monk, it should be noted that the Maraṇāsanna Nimitta can be changed in accordance with the arising of Right Attention = Yoniso Manasikāra or Wrong Attention = Ayoniso Manasikāra.
Due to such changes in Nimitta, it could happened that in the insight of the meditator who is investigating and searching for the past causes, the Upatthambhaka Kamma may appeared first and not Janaka Kamma.
In discerning the past life and searching for the causes, sometimes the meditator may bypassed the object of Maraṇāsanna Javana and happened to discern the objects in the past life Nāma processes which were arising before the occurrence of Maraṇāsanna Javana.
In such cases, after having found Upatthambhaka Kamma first, the Janaka Kamma is found later by checking.

Furthermore, in the period before the occurrence of Maraṇāsanna Javana there may be various objects arising.
Also, the object of Maraṇāsanna Javana may appear earlier, in advance, before the occurrence of Maraṇāsanna Javana.
It is like the incident of the great Upāsakā Dhammika where at the time of near his death, the Nimitta of 6 chariots from 6 deity realms appeared.
When the great Upāsāka Dhammika chose that of the Tusita realm among those 6 chariots, then only the Tusita chariot appeared in the last moment of Maraṇāsanna Javana.

**Discernment Of Causes And Effects**

In discerning and searching for the past causes based on the Nimitta which appeared at the time of Maraṇāsanna like that, let us refer again to that Nimitta object of offering food at the Pagoda which appeared at the time of Maraṇāsanna Javana as mentioned above.
After having discerned the Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra-Kamma in the NāmaRūpa processes of offering the food, investigate and search whether there is any causal relationship between that Kamma Satti force and the 30 types of Rūpa of the 1st stage foetus formation moment.
Discerning the cause and effect alternately, try to see if they match.
If the meditator found that there is causal relationship between causes and effects (just as there is causal relationship between mind and Cittaja Rūpa), then he should discern the causes and effects as follow:

Because of the arising of Avijjā (20), Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa arise.

Avijjā is the cause; Paṭisandhi Rūpakkhandhā is the effect....etc.

Discern the causes and effects in this way, having linked the causal relationship between causes and effects; distinguish it by insight.
This discernment is called Paccaya Pariggaha ñāṇa.

**Essential Points To Take Note In Advance**

The past causes of Rūpakkhandhā = Rūpa dhamma are Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra-Kamma; the present causes are Citta, Utu and Āhāra.

In other words:

1. The causes of Kammaja Rūpa (which are part of the Rūpakkhandhā) are Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra-Kamma.
   These are the past causes.

2. The cause of Cittaja Rūpa is Citta (mind) which arises dependent upon Hadaya Vatthu.

3. The cause of Utuja Rūpa is Utu called Tejo dhātu which reaches the static stage (Ṭhīti) in almost every Rūpa Kalāpa.

(NOTES: As mentioned in the Rūpa Kammaṭṭhāna stage that in the production of Rūpa Kalāpa sequentially by Utu called Tejo dhātu in Cittaja Kalāpa, Utuja Kalāpa, Āhāraja Kalāpa and Kammaja Kalāpa such as Cakkhu Dasaka Kalāpa, the Tejo dhātu of Rūpa Kalāpas which are produced like that in the last phase cannot produce Utuja Rūpa.
That is why it is mentioned above as &#39;in almost every Rūpa Kalāpa&#39;.
Take note that it is similar for Āhāraja Rūpa, mentioned as follows.)

4. The cause of Āhāraja Rūpa is Āhāra which are Kammaja Ojā, Cittaja Ojā, Utuja Ojā and Āhāraja Ojā.

(NOTES: Refer again as to how Kabaḷīkārāhāra Ojā, the food that are eaten, produce Rūpa and how each Kammaja Ojā, Cittaja Ojā, Utuja Ojā and Āhāraja Ojā produce Rūpa when they get the support of that Āhāra Ojā.
Ojā in a previous Ojaṭṭhamaka Rūpa produces another new Ojaṭṭhamaka Rūpa if it gets the support of a subsequent Āhāraja Ojā.
Therefore Āhāraja Ojā is mentioned as a cause of Āhāraja Rūpa.)

**Four Nāma Khandhā**

The past causes of these Nāma dhamma: (i) the Vipāka 4 Nāma Khandhā which are without Vīthi process, i.e.
Paṭisandhi, Bhavaṅga &amp; Cuti; and (ii) the Vipāka 4 Nāma Khandhā in Vīthi mind processes which are PañcaViññāṇa (such as CakkhuViññāṇa...etc), Sampaṭicchana, Santīraṇa and Tadārammaṇa are Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra-Kamma.
The present causes of these Nāma dhamma are:

1. Vatthu (Basis Vatthu Rūpa; they cannot arise without Basis Vatthu Rūpa),

2. Object (These Nāma can arise only when a pertinent object impinges on the respective dvāra.
   Only when there is an object to know then knowing can arise.
   Understand it like that),

3. Phassa (Only if the accompanying Sampayutta dhamma such as Phassa...etc support each other by means of Satti such as Sahajāta, Aññamañña, Nissaya then these Nāma can arise).

Furthermore, as the Kusala-Akusala Kiriyā Nāma dhamma which are Pañcadvārāvajjana, Votthapana, Javana and Manodvārāvajjana existing in the Vīthi mind processes are not produced by past causes but are the Nāma dhamma produced by causes such as Vatthu-Object-Phassa-Yoniso Manasikāra-Ayoniso Manasikāra only, they do not have past causes; they only have present causes such as Vatthu-Object-Phassa...etc.
If able to understand this much then it is expected that one can understand the discernment which will be mentioned later.

1. **Ekatta Ways**

When the meditator discerns the causal relationships, Paṭicca Samuppāda, he must discern to understand the 4 ways which are Ekatta way, Nānatta way, Abyāpāra way and Evaṁ Dhammatā way.
They are very important in the discernment of Paṭicca Samuppāda.

Among these 4 ways, concerning the Ekatta way:- There are past NāmaRūpa, present NāmaRūpa and future NāmaRūpa respectively which are:

1. past NāmaRūpa which accumulated the past causes,

2. NāmaRūpa which are occurring beginning from the present life Paṭisandhi until the present time of meditating Vipassanā or discerning the causal relationships, Paṭicca Samuppāda,

3. if there are future lives as one is still not able to meditate until final attainment yet, then there are future NāmaRūpa which are going to arise beginning from the present time (i.e.
   beginning from the time of discerning the causal relationships, Paṭicca Samuppāda) until the last future life.

The meditator must discern that the NāmaRūpa which had arose, are arising, and will arise in the three periods of past-present-future are a single sequential process of NāmaRūpa.

To clarify the above:- In discerning both the Mind Clear Element of the period in the past life when accumulating the Kusala wholesome deed which produced this human life and the Mind Clear Element of the present life, discern to understand that they are occurring in a single sequential process successively as a Santati continuity process.
Discern precisely whether the Bhavaṅga Mind Clearness which is part of the NāmaRūpa continuity process while doing the Kusala wholesome deed in the past life is one&#39;s own Bhavaṅga Mind Clearness or not.
If it is truly one&#39;s own Bhavaṅga Mind Clearness then one will easily understand about the fact that it is one&#39;s own Bhavaṅga Mind Clearness.
As Bhavaṅga occurs the most frequent in one whole life, it is mentioned mainly so that one can understand easily.
Take note that the way is the same for the other Nāma continuity processes.
The Rūpa continuity processes also occur in the same way, in a single sequential process successively.

**Three Or Four Persons**

Sometimes for some meditators there are 3 or 4 persons doing Kusala wholesome deeds in the object (nimitta) of doing Kusala wholesome deed.
If that is so, discern their 4 Great Elements and then their NāmaRūpa, one person after another.
Then discern especially the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element of each person.
The meditator can easily understand whether the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element is his or not.
The reason is that when the meditator realises penetratively himself by the Paññā-eye insight that the present life Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element and the past life Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element are occurring in a single sequential process as a Nāma continuity, then he can easily understand that the past Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element is his.
However, if the past Bhavaṅga Mind Clearness which he has discerned is not his own then he can easily understand that it is not his Bhavaṅga Mind Clearness.
The reason is that the Nāma continuity processes are not connected.
If the past Nāma Rūpa is not one&#39;s own then the NāmaRūpa continuity process of others in the past and the meditator&#39;s NāmaRūpa continuity process are not occurring in a single sequential process; the continuity processes are not connected.

One&#39;s own past life NāmaRūpa process and present life NāmaRūpa process are arising successively, being connected between the preceding and the subsequent in a single sequential process.
If the meditator realises that the NāmaRūpa are arising successively in a single sequential process like that then it is said that he realises the Ekatta way.
Understand that it is similar in discerning that the present NāmaRūpa continuity processes and the future NāmaRūpa continuity processes are arising successively in a single sequential process, being connected as a Santati continuity process.

**Uccheda And Sassata (Views)**

This insight, which realises penetratively the unbroken NāmaRūpa continuity process, linking the causal relationships between causes and effects such as between past life cause and present life effect; between present life cause and future life effect...etc., can remove the Uccheda wrong view which holds the view that, &#39;Life is only between cradle and coffin.
There is no more existence after death.
There is nothing beyond coffin&#39;.
Without realising the causal relationships between cause and effect like that but seeing it wrongly then Sassata wrong view can arise.
Seeing it wrongly means that one holds the wrong view on the unbroken causal relationships between causes and effects, the unbroken NāmaRūpa continuity process as a single occurrence.
As one does not realise the Anicca, Dukkha and Anatta nature of both the cause NāmaRūpa and Effect NāmaRūpa, he holds the view that it is one permanent NāmaRūpa process.
This wrong view is Sassata diṭṭhi.
(Vism., XVII, 310)

**2) Nānatta Way**

When one can discern Avijjā-Saṅkhāra-Viññāṇa-NāmāRūpa-Saḷāyatana-Phassa-Vedanā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Bhava-Jāti-JarāMaraṇa...etc which are the causal relationships occurring in a single continuity sequential process, then in these causes NāmaRūpa and effects NāmaRūpa:

1. if realising them distinguishingly as individual mind moments and as individual separated Rūpa Kalāpa,

2. and if, after having broken down by insight Rūpa Kalāpas and the Nāma Kalāpa which exist in one mind moment, differentiating and distinguishing them individually,

3. (As mentioned above, the Paṭicca Samuppāda factors such as Avijjā-Saṅkhāra-Viññāṇa-NāmāRūpa...etc cannot arise singly; it is natural that it arises only in groups as NāmaKalāpa-RūpaKalāpa) and if able to realise penetratively the arising of only new Paramattha dhātu, after having distinguished as they really are, the intrinsic characteristic - Sabhāva lakkhaṇa - of each Paramattha dhātu existing in one Nāma Kalāpa (i.e.
   a group of Nāma dhamma arising in one mind moment) and the intrinsic characteristic of each Paramattha dhātu existing in one Rūpa Kalāpa,

then it is said that one knows the Nānatta way.
One must discern the Paramattha dhātu by way of Characteristic-Function-Manifestation-Proximate Cause (Lakkhaṇa-Rasa-Paccupaṭṭhāna-Padaṭṭhāna) thoroughly by insight, so that one can realise like that.
If one realises the Nānatta way well, as he is realising himself penetratively about the arising of new Paramattha dhātu linked between causes and effects, then Sassata diṭṭhi can be removed.
However, if one sees it wrongly, i.e.
as one holds the view that the NāmaRūpa groups arising in a single NāmaRūpa process are each different processes, then one will hold the Uccheda diṭṭhi wrong view that, &#39;In this life, this person experiences; in that life, that person experiences&#39;.
(It means that it is Uccheda diṭṭhi when one holds the view that they are different separate processes, i.e.
the one who did the wholesome or unwholesome deeds is one, and the one who experiences the good or bad effects is another).

**3) Abyāpāra Way**

On the side of causes, there is no endeavour (byāpāra) that they will make the effects to arise.
On the side of effects also, there is no endeavour (byāpāra) such as, &quot;We, the effects will arise if the causes arise&quot;.
There is no endeavour in Avijjā such as, &quot;I will produce Saṅkhāra&quot;.
In Saṅkhāra also, there is no endeavour such as, &quot;We will produce Viññāṇa&quot;.
Not having endeavour, being free from endeavour in Avijjā, Saṅkhāra...etc is the Abyāpāra way.
If the meditator realises himself penetratively the Abyāpāra way well, then he can remove Atta diṭṭhi which holds the view that there is Jiva Atta who creates.
This is because one is realising penetratively that there is no endeavour (byāpāra) in the causes to produce the effects.
Without realising the Abyāpāra way well and correctly, but if seeing it wrongly, when one cannot accept that although there is no endeavour to produce the effect it is a fixed natural law (Sabhāva Niyāma) that causes such as Avijjā can produce effects such as Saṅkhāra, then one will hold the wrong view of Akiriya diṭṭhi that &#39;although done, it is not done&#39;.

**Fixed Natural Law - Sabhāva Niyāma**

If cause such as Avijjā exists then effect such as Saṅkhāra arises.
If cause such as Avijjā does not exist then effect such as Saṅkhāra also does not exist.
In other words, if causes such as Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra-Kamma exist then effects such as Viññāṇa-NāmāRūpa-Saḷāyatana-Phassa-Vedanā arise.
If causes such as Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra-Kamma do not exist then effects such as Viññāṇa-NāmāRūpa-Saḷāyatana-Phassa-Vedanā also do not arise.
This is the occurrence by nature = sabhāva niyāma siddha hotūBhāva.
If one does not accept the existence of the natural force, Satti, in the cause such as Avijjā which can produce effect such as Saṅkhāra, then the wrong view, Akiriya diṭṭhi, which rejects the existence of Kamma and its effect will arise.

**4) Evaṁ Dhammatā Way**

As curd is produced from milk only, similarly when effect is to arise because of the cause, Avijjā, then only the effect, Saṅkhāra, comes to arise.
No other effect arises.
In other words, when effects are to arise because of the causes, Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna-Saṅkhāra-Kamma, then only the effects, Viññāṇa-NāmāRūpa-Saḷāyatana-Phassa-Vedanā, come to arise.
No other effects can arise.
This is called Evaṁ Dhammatā way.
If the meditator realises the Evaṁ Dhammatā well and rightly, then as he realises penetratively by the &#39;eyes&#39; of insight the arising of effect according to the appropriate cause, he can remove both wrong views of Ahetuka diṭṭhi, which holds the view that there is no cause, and Akiriya diṭṭhi, which holds the view that &#39;what is done is not done&#39;; i.e.
two wrong views which reject that the Effect is produced by the Cause, or in other words, rejecting that there is any causes and effects.

Without realising it well and correctly, but sees it wrongly, then as one cannot agree and accept that the arising of an effect is according to the appropriate cause; not accepting that the appropriate cause produce the appropriate effect, one will hold the wrong views of Ahetuka diṭṭhi and Niyata Vāda.
(Vism., XVII)

**Niyata Vāda**

Niyata vāda is the belief that the good and the bad effects of living beings are fixed.
This is a belief which reject that there is Kamma and its effect.

Therefore, one should know that the penetrative realization of causal relationships, Paṭicca Samuppāda, by oneself is the best &#39;weapon&#39; to remove various wrong views.

**Important Notes**

The object of the following 4 types of mind are the same:

1. the object of Maraṇāsanna Javana, while on the verge of death in the past life;

2. the object of Paṭisandhi Citta in the present life;

3. the object of Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element in the present life;

4. the object of Cuti Citta which will occur in the present life.

As the meditator has not yet discerned the future, he must discern and check by insight the objects in numbers 1,2 and 3 among these 4 types to see whether they are the same or not, precisely and carefully.
Another point is that the quantity of Citta-cetasika in Paṭisandhi Citta, Bhavaṅga Citta and Cuti Citta must be the same.
Check attentively and precisely.
Discern repeatedly.
At this stage the meditator should have already been able to discern the Bhavaṅga Mind Clear Element correctly.
If one is still not able to discern it, then discern the Paṭisandhi Nāma dhamma again precisely.
After that further discern the Citta-cetasika = Nāma dhamma group which are arising successively, subsequent to the perishing away of the Paṭisandhi Citta-cetasika, just before the arising of Vīthi Cittas.
These are the mind which continue to arise when Vīthi Cittas are not arising, so that the mind process is not broken in a life -- being the cause of life (Bhava).
If understood this, then continue to discern the Bhavaṅga Nāma dhammas which are arising in between Vīthi mind processes.
One will be successful.

**Grouping The 5 Khandhā**

In discerning the causes and effects of causal relationships according to the Paṭicca Samuppāda 5th method, the meditator must discern by the 5 Khandhā method, having grouped every mind moment into 5 Khandhā and having linked the causes and effects.
Paṭisandhi, Bhavaṅga and Cuti are Vīthi Mutta Citta which are without Vīthi mind process.
In these Vīthi Mutta Citta, the meditator links the causes and effects after having grouped into 5 Khandhā.
In Vīthi minds also, the causes and effects must be discerned after having grouped into 5 Khandhā and having linked the causes and effects in every mind moment.

&#39;Khandhā&#39; means aggregate.

1. The aggregate of Rūpa existing in these 11 ways: past-future-present-internal-external-gross-subtle-inferior-superior-far-near which are the object of Āsava dhamma, grasped as &#39;I-mine&#39; by Taṇhā-Diṭṭhi is called Rūpupādānakkhandhā.

2. The aggregate of feelings = Vedanā existing in these 11 ways: past-future-present-internal-external-gross-subtle-inferior-superior-far-near which are the object of Āsava dhamma, grasped as &#39;I-mine&#39; by Taṇhā-Diṭṭhi is called Vedanupādānakkhandhā.

3. The aggregate of Saññā, in the same way, is called Saññupādānakkhandhā.

4. The aggregate of Cetasika Saṅkhāra dhamma, in the same way, is called Saṅkhārupādānakkhandhā.

5. The aggregate of consciousness, in the same way, is called Viññāṇupādānakkhandhā.

(Refer to Khandhā Sutta of Khandhā Vagga, Saṁyutta Nikāya).

Having grouped each mind moment which occurs in any of these 11 ways together with its Basis Vatthu Rūpa and object Rūpa the 5 Khandhā can be enumerated.
In each mind moment:

1. the Basis Vatthu Rūpa and object Rūpa are Rūpakkhandhā;

2. the Vedanā is Vedanākkhandhā;

3. the Saññā is Saññākkhandhā;

4. excluding Vedanā-Saññā-Viññāṇa, all the remaining Cetasikas in one mind moment is Saṅkhārakkhandhā;

5. the consciousness = Viññāṇa is Viññāṇakkhandhā.

If understood the above definition then one will also understand the classification of the 5 Khandhā for each mind moment which will be further mentioned.
As each of these 5 Khandhā has its respective cause, discern the respective causes and effects after having linked the causal relationships between the corresponding causes and effects.

**Paṭisandhi 5 Khandhā (At The Moment Of 1st Stage Of Foetus Formation)**

At the moment of Paṭisandhi, at the time of the 1st stage foetus formation:

1. the 30 types of Rūpa = 3 types of Rūpa Kalāpa which are Hadaya Dasaka Kalāpa, Kāya Dasaka Kalāpa, Bhāva Dasaka Kalāpa are the Rūpakkhandhā;

2. the Vedanā in the 34 Nāma dhamma of Paṭisandhi is Vedanākkhandhā;

3. the Saññā in the 34 Nāma dhamma of Paṭisandhi is Saññākkhandhā;

4. (1st way) the Cetanā in the 34 Nāma dhamma of Paṭisandhi is Saṅkhārakkhandhā;

(2nd way) excluding Vedanā-Saññā-Viññāṇa in the 34 Nāma dhamma of Paṭisandhi, the remaining 31 Nāma dhamma are Saṅkhārakkhandhā;

5. the consciousness = Viññāṇa in the 34 Nāma dhamma of Paṭisandhi is Viññāṇakkhandhā.

{These 5 Khandhā are for the Tihetuka person whose Paṭisandhi is accompanied with Somanassa Vedanā.
If one is a Tihetuka person whose Patisandhi is accompanied with Upekkhā Vedanā, then as there is no Pīti; there are 33 Nāma dhamma.
If one is a Dvihetuka person, then there may be 33 or 32 Nāma dhamma.
As for showing the 2 ways of discernment in Saṅkhārakkhandhā, the Buddha taught mainly just Cetanā only when teaching about Saṅkhārakkhandhā by means of Suttanta method in Khandhā Vibhaṅga Pāḷi.
Therefore in the first way, mainly Cetanā is shown as Saṅkhārakkhandhā.
Then, if only Cetanā is taken as Saṅkhārakkhandhā, the remaining Cetasikas will be excluded from the 5 Khandhā.
Furthermore, one may ask that, &quot;Aren&#39;t there corresponding causes for the other remaining Cetasikas also?&quot;.
Therefore, the 2nd way of forming Saṅkhārakkhandhā is further shown for the following reasons: (i) so that one can realise that the remaining Cetasikas have their respective causes and (ii) so that none of the Paramattha dhātu are left out.
Take note that it is the same in every case for Saṅkhārakkhandhā.}

**Discernment Of Causal Relationships Between Causes And Effects**

Firstly the meditator is to discern to understand that, among the 5 past causes &#39;found&#39; (discerned), the arising of Kamma Vaṭṭa, which is Saṅkhāra-Kamma, is because of the Kilesa Vaṭṭa, which is Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna.
Then, linking the causal relationships, discern to realise that the arising of the Paṭisandhi Rūpakkhandhā which is part of the Vipāka Vaṭṭa is because of the Kamma Satti force which is part of the Kamma Vaṭṭa (which is Saṅkhāra-Kamma).
When the meditator sees by insight the cause, Kamma, and the effect, Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa, or, in other words, in seeing the cause, i.e.
Saṅkhāra-Kamma which is surrounded by Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna, and the effect, Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa; that is, in seeing the arising of the effects is dependent upon the causes, discern the causes and effects as follows:

**Paṭisandhi Rūpakkhandhā**

1. Because of the arising of Avijjā (20), Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa arises.

Avijjā (20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa is the effect.

2. Because of the arising of Taṇhā (20), Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa arises.

Taṇhā (20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa is the effect.

3. Because of the arising of Upādāna (20), Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa arises.

Upādāna (20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa is the effect.

4. Because of the arising of Saṅkhāra (34), Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa arises.

Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa is the effect.

5. Because of the arising of Kamma Satti force of the Kamma = Saṅkhāra (34), Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa arises.

Kamma Satti force of the Kamma = Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Kammaja Rūpa is the effect.

NOTES: The &#39;20&#39; in Avijjā-Taṇhā-Upādāna refers to the Lobha-Diṭṭhi group of Nāma dhamma in each LobhaJavana in Kilesa Vaṭṭa Manodvārika Javana Vīthi.
The &#39;34&#39; in Saṇkhāra-Kamma refers to the Saddhā-Paññā group Nāma dhamma in each MahaKusala Javana in Kamma Vaṭṭa Manodvārika Javana Vīthi.
If the meditator accumulated the Kamma accompanied with Upekkhā Vedanā, then as Pīti is not included in the Saṅkhāra-Kamma which were accompanied with Upekkhā Vedanā, there are 33 Nāma dhamma.
As those who are able to discern and distinguish the Rūpa-Nāma, Causes-Effects till this level are mostly Tihetuka person, only the example of Tihetuka person is mentioned here.
Understand that for a Dvihetuka person, there may be 33 or 32...etc Nāma dhamma.
As Cittaja Rūpa, Utuja Rūpa and Āhāraja Rūpa do not arise yet at the moment of the arising (uppāda) of Paṭisandhi, only the causal relationships with Kammaja Rūpa is shown here.

Similarly, in Nāma Khandhā such as Vedanākkhandhā, firstly discern to see by insight that &#39;because of the apparent arising = apparent existence of the cause, the effect arises&#39;.
Only when one realised it penetratively by oneself with the SammāDiṭṭhi Paññā &#39;eyes&#39;, then discern the causes and effects as follows:

**Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā**

The five past causes:

1. Because of the arising of Avijjā (=20), Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā arises.

Avijjā (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

2. Because of the arising of Taṇhā (=20), Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā arises.

Taṇhā (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

3. Because of the arising of Upādāna (=20), Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā arises.

Upādāna (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

4. Because of the arising of Saṅkhāra (34), Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā arises.

Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

5. Because of the arising of Kamma Satti force of the Kamma = Saṅkhāra (34), Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā arises.

Kamma Satti force of the Kamma = Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

The three present causes:

6. Because of the arising of Vatthu = Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa (=30), Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā arises.

Vatthu = Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa (=30) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

7. Because of the arising of object (=\_\_\_\_), Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā arises.

Object (=\_\_\_\_) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

8. Because of the arising of Phassa (34-Vedanā=33), Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā arises.

Phassa (34-Vedanā=33) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

Discern the causes and the effects in this way.
However to shorten the book, from here on only the statements such as, &quot;Avijjā (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect&quot; will be shown in the followings, leaving out the statements such as, &quot; Because of the arising of Avijjā (=20), Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā arises&quot;.
But when discerning the causes and effects in meditation, discern as the above.
In order that you can follow this way of writing, the discernment of Vedanākkhandhā will be shown again below, written in the shortened way.

**Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā**

The five past causes:

1. Avijjā (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

2. Taṇhā (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

3. Upādāna (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

4. Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

5. Kamma Satti force of the Kamma = Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

The three present causes:

6. Vatthu = Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa (30) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

7. Object (=\_\_\_\_) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

8. Phassa (34-Vedanā=33) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

**Explanation**

1. **VATTHU:** - In Pañcavokāra realm where 5 Khandhā exist, Nāma dhamma can arise only if there is Basis Vatthu Rūpa.
   They cannot arise without a Basis Vatthu Rūpa.
   The Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā which is part of Paṭisandhi Nāma dhamma arises only dependent upon the Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa which arises simultaneously with it at the moment of Paṭisandhi.
   They cannot arise without dependent upon it.
   Furthermore, the Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa cannot arise by itself singly; it can arise only in group called Rūpa Kalāpa.
   Especially, it can arise only when it gets to be dependent upon the 4 Great Elements of the same Kalāpa which can support it by means of Satti such as Sahajāta; it cannot arise without getting to be dependent upon it.
   Furthermore, the Hadaya Dasaka Kalāpa can only arise simultaneously with KāyaDasaka Kalāpa and Bhāva Dasaka Kalāpa.

Therefore, according to the Suttanta method mentioned as -- Vatthu nāma karajakāyo.......so atthato bhūtāni ceva upādārūpāni ca -- Vatthu is KarajaKāya.
Those KarajaKāya are the Bhūta Rūpa and Upādā Rūpa in ultimate reality.
According to the commentary like that, after having broken down the compactness of Rūpa and attaining the insight of ultimate reality of Rūpa, take the Bhūta Rūpa and Upādā Rūpa as &#39;Vatthu Rūpa&#39;.
Therefore according to Abhidhamma method, only the Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa is taken as the Basis Vatthu Rūpa of Paṭisandhi Vedanā.
According to Suttanta method, Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa together with the 30 types of Rūpa are taken as &#39;Vatthu Rūpa&#39;; Suttanta method is the method to practise upon.
To break down the compactness and to attain the insight of ultimate reality, all 30 types must firstly be discerned.
Therefore, take note that according to the Suttanta method, the Hadaya Vatthu together with the 30 types of Rūpa are called Vatthu Rūpa.
Having realised penetratively by oneself with the SammaDiṭṭhi ñāṇa Paññā &#39;eyes&#39; that Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā can arise only when it gets to be dependent upon that Vatthu Rūpa, discern the causes and effects.
Take note that it is the same in every case for Vatthu.
Discern it according to these explanations, i.e.:

Because of the arising of Vatthu = Hadaya Vatthu (30), Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā arises.

Vatthu = Hadaya Vatthu (30) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

2. **OBJECT:** - It is already explained that the object of Paṭisandhi Nāma is the object of the Maraṇāsanna Javana in the past life.
   Vedanā experiences the feel of that object.
   Discern to understand by insight that if there is no object to experience then Vedanā (the feeling) cannot arise.
   The object of offering food at the pagoda was mentioned earlier as an example.
   The Kamma among meditators are mostly not the same with each other.
   For some persons their Dāna Kamma produce the effect; while for some persons their Sīla Kamma produce the effect; and for some other persons their Bhāvanā Kamma produce the effect.
   Furthermore, in Dāna Kamma it is of various types such as Dāna Kamma in offering almsfood, Dāna Kamma in offering robes...etc.
   As for Sīla Kamma it is also of various types such as 5 precepts Sīla Kamma, 8 precepts Sīla Kamma, 10 precepts Sīla Kamma...etc.
   As for Bhāvanā Kamma, it is also of various types such as Kasiṇa Bhāvanā Kamma, Asubha Bhāvanā Kamma, Ānāpāna Bhāvanā Kamma, Mettā Bhāvanā Kamma, Vipassanā Bhāvanā Kamma...etc.
   As there are various types of Kamma like that, there are also various types of object.
   After having discerned by insight that Vedanā (the feeling) can arise only when there is an object to experience, further discern the cause and effect as follows:

Because of the arising of object (=\_\_\_\_), Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā arises.

Object (=\_\_\_\_) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

3. **PHASSA:** - Take note that in such teachings as &quot;Phassa samudayā vedanā samudayo = Because of the arising of Phassa, Vedanā arises&quot;, Phassa is taught as being the predominant mainly.
   In Paṭṭhāna it is taught as:

Cattāro khandhā arūpino aññamaññaṁ sahajātapaccayena paccayo

Cattāro khandhā arūpino aññamaññaṁ nissayapaccayena paccayo

--the 4 Nāma Khandhā support each other by means of Sahajātapaccaya Satti and Nissayapaccaya Satti (Paṭṭhāna-Vol.1-pg.5 Burmese script).

Thus it is taught.
Nāma dhammas, being dependent upon each other mutually, support each other; just like the (Burmese) idiom, &quot;the island exist dependent upon land, the land exist dependent upon island&quot;.

While eating some food, when one can chew more on it and so when more essence liquid comes out from it, the taste becomes more intense; similarly, if the Phassa in the Nāma dhammas which arise simultaneously in one mind moment and in the Nāma dhammas of different mind moments impinge on the object thoroughly, that is, if Phassa connect the consciousness with the object, then the feeling (Vedanā) of the &#39;essence&#39; of the object will be more thorough.
That is why it is taught as Vedanā arise because of Phassa by way of predominance.
However, Phassa cannot arise by itself singly.
Only when the remaining Citta-cetasika Sampayutta dhamma support it, then it can arise accompanied by these Citta-cetasika Sampayutta dhamma.
Therefore, just as the idiom &quot;when pulling one stalk of creeper, the whole group of tangled creepers will follow&quot;, take note that if Phassa is mentioned then the accompanying Sampayutta dhamma are also included.

The essential points to note is that among the group of accompanying Sampayutta dhamma which exist in one mind moment, if one Nāma dhamma is the effect = if one Nāma dhamma is taken as the effect, then the remaining Nāma dhammas are the causes.
If two or three Nāma dhammas are taken as the effects, then the remaining Nāma dhammas are the causes.
This is an essential point to note.
For the remaining Nāma Khandhā, understand that it is based on this method in Vedanākkhandha.
Discern to see by insight that Nāma dhamma supports each other or the group of Nāma dhammas such as Phassa support Vedanā; in other words, Saññākkhandha, Saṅkhārakkhandhā and Viññāṇakkhandhā support Vedanākkhandhā by means of Sahajāta, Aññamañña, Nissaya...etc PaccayaSatti, one dependent upon the other, i.e.
the causal relationships between one another.
Only after realising it by insight, discern the cause and effect as follows:

Because of the arising of Phassa (34-Vedanā=33), Vedanākkhandhā arises.

Phassa (34-Vedanā=33) is the cause, Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

**Paṭisandhi - Saññākkhandhā**

The five past causes:

1. Avijjā (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

2. Taṇhā (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

3. Upādāna (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

4. Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

5. Kamma Satti force of the Kamma = Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

The three present causes:

6. Vatthu = Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa (30) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

7. Object (=\_\_\_\_) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

8. Phassa (34-Saññā=33) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

**Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā (1st Way: Regarding It As &#39;Cetanā&#39;)**

The five past causes:

1. Avijjā (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

2. Taṇhā (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

3. Upādāna (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

4. Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

5. Kamma Satti force of the Kamma = Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

The three present causes:

6. Vatthu = Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa (30) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

7. Object (=\_\_\_\_) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

8. Phassa (34-Cetanā=33) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

(In this 1st way, only Cetanā is regarded predominantly as Saṅkhārakkhandhā.
In order that none of the Paramattha dhātu is left out, another way of discernment will be shown.)

**Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā (2nd Way: Regarding It As 31 Cetasika)**

The five past causes:

1. Avijjā (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

2. Taṇhā (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

3. Upādāna (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

4. Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

5. Kamma Satti force of the Kamma = Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

The three present causes:

6. Vatthu = Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa (30) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

7. Object (=\_\_\_\_) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

8. The remaining three Nāma Khandhā is the cause, Paṭisandhi Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

{NOTES: In subtracting Vedanā, Saññā and Viññāṇa from the Paṭisandhi 34 Nāma dhamma, there are remaining 31 Cetasika where Phassa and Cetanā are predominant.
In this 2nd way, those 31 Cetasika are called &#39;Saṅkhārakkhandhā&#39;; they are the effects.
If one looks for the present cause of the Saṅkhārakkhandhā where Phassa and Cetanā are predominant, then --sesakkhandhattayapadaṭṭhānā -- the remaining three Nāma Khandhā, Vedanā-Saññā-Viññāṇa, are the proximate cause, Padaṭṭhāna.
They are the nearest cause.
As one may ask that, &quot;if Phassa is the cause of Nāma Khandhā, then isn&#39;t there any cause for that Phassa or the remaining Cetasika called Saṅkhārakkhandhā?&quot;, therefore in this 2nd way of discernment all causes and effects are discerned.
Note that the method is the same for further cases.}

**Paṭisandhi Viññāṇakkhandhā**

The five past causes:

1. Avijjā (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

2. Taṇhā (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

3. Upādāna (=20) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

4. Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

5. Kamma Satti force of the Kamma = Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

The three present causes:

6. Vatthu = Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa (30) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

7. Object (=\_\_\_\_) is the cause, Paṭisandhi Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

8. Nāma+Rūpa is the cause, Paṭisandhi Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

&#39;Nāma&#39; = the accompanying 33 Cetasika;

&#39;Rūpa&#39; = Basis Vatthu Rūpa (3 = 30) + object Rūpa.

{NOTES: &#39;Nāma&#39; here means the group of Cetasika that arise together with Viññāṇa in one mind moment.
In Paṭisandhi it refers to the 33 Cetasika which arise together with the Paṭisandhi Viññāṇa.
If the Paṭisandhi of the meditator is accompanied with Upekkhā Vedanā, then as Pīti cannot be accompanying, there are 32 Cetasika in &#39;Nāma&#39;.
&#39;Rūpa&#39; refers to Basis Vatthu Rūpa and object Rūpa.
As for the object of Paṭisandhi Citta, it is one of these three objects: Kamma or Kamma Nimitta or Gati Nimitta.
If it is a Rūpārammaṇa, then the Rūpārammaṇa is the object Rūpa.
If it is a Saddārammaṇa then the Saddārammaṇa is the object Rūpa.
Understand it in this manner.
There is a teaching that, &#39;Nāmarūpasamudayā viññāṅasamudayo = because of the arising of NāmaRūpa, Viññāṇa arises&#39; (Saṁyutta Nikāya-Vol.2-pg.53 Burmese script) and there is also a teaching that, &#39;Viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṁ = because of the arising of Viññāṇa, NāmaRūpa arises&#39;.
Therefore, take note that Viññāṇa and NāmaRūpa support each other mutually.
In this case, the meditator must discern the cause and effect after having discerned by insight the causal relationships in NāmaRūpa produce Viññāṇa = the arising of Viññāṇakkhandhā.
Although the causes, &#39;Vatthu&#39;+&#39;Object&#39;+&#39;Phassa&#39; and the causes, &#39;NāmaRūpa&#39; are different in words, they are the same in the nature of ultimate reality, Paramattha dhātu.
Discern it as follows:

Because of the arising of NāmaRūpa, Paṭisandhi Viññāṇakkhandhā arises.

NāmaRūpa is the cause, Paṭisandhi Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.}

Then subsequent to Paṭisandhi, after 15 times or 16 times of Bhavaṅga had arisen, the Vīthi Citta processes which are: Manodvārāvajjana (1 time)-Bhava Nikantika Lobha Javana (7 times)(= Lobha Javana which is attachment to the new state of existence) begin to arise.
At the moment of Bhavaṅga Citta, such as the 1st Bhavaṅga Citta, Cittaja Rūpa and Utuja Rūpa already arose.
There is a teaching in the Text that Utuja Rūpa begin to arise at the static moment of Paṭisandhi.
Āhāraja Rūpa begin to arise when food/Āhāra eaten by the mother spread to the foetus.
Therefore if the meditator wants to discern the Bhavaṅga 5 Khandhā subsequent to Paṭisandhi, then after having linked the causal relationships, add and discern the following two more present cause &amp; effect in Rūpakkhandhā:

1. Because of the arising of mind, Cittaja Rūpa arises.

Mind is the cause, Cittaja Rūpa is the effect.

2. Because of the arising of Utu, Utuja Rūpa arises.

Utu is the cause, Utuja Rūpa is the effect.

The discernments of 4 Nāma Khandhā are the same with the 4 Nāma Khandhā in Paṭisandhi.
The discernment of the causal relationships in Manodvārāvajjana 5 Khandhā and Javana 5 Khandhā which arise after 15 or 16 times of Bhavaṅga subsequent to Paṭisandhi will be further mention as follows:

**Manodvārāvajjana 5 Khandhā**

1. 5 types of Rūpa Kalāpa, i.e.
   46 types of Rūpa are Rūpakkhandhā.
   These are: 3 types of Kammaja Rūpa Kalāpa which include the Hadaya Vatthu existing in Hadaya where that Manodvārāvajjana is dependent upon, one type of Cittaja Rūpa and one type of Utuja Rūpa Kalāpa.
   (At that moment Āhāraja Rūpa cannot arise yet).

2. The (Upekkhā) Vedanā in Manodvārāvajjana 12 Nāma dhamma is Vedanākkhandhā.

3. The Saññā in Manodvārāvajjana 12 Nāma dhamma is Saññākkhandhā.

4. (i) The Cetanā in Manodvārāvajjana 12 Nāma dhamma is Saṅkhārakkhandhā (1st way).

(ii) The remaining 9 Cetasikas in Manodvārāvajjana 12 Nāma dhamma is Saṅkhārakkhandhā (2nd way).

5. The consciousness, Viññāṇa in Manodvārāvajjana 12 Nāma dhamma is Viññāṇakkhandhā.

**Manodvārāvajjana Rūpakkhandhā**

The five past causes:

1. Avijjā (=20) is the cause, Rūpakkhandhā is the effect.

2. Taṇhā (=20) is the cause, Rūpakkhandhā is the effect.

3. Upādāna (=20) is the cause, Rūpakkhandhā is the effect.

4. Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Rūpakkhandhā is the effect.

5. Kamma Satti force of the Kamma = Saṅkhāra (34) is the cause, Rūpakkhandhā is the effect.

The two present causes:

6. Mind is the cause, (Cittaja Rūpa) Rūpakkhandhā is the effect.

7. Utu is the cause, (Utuja Rūpa) Rūpakkhandhā is the effect.

**Manodvārāvajjana - Vedanākkhandhā**

(As these Manodvārāvajjana Nāma dhammas group is only functional mental states = Kiriyā Citta and not Vipāka Nāma dhamma, they are not produced by past causes.
Therefore take note that Manodvārāvajjana Nāma dhammas do not have past causes; they have present causes only.)

The 3 present causes:

1. Vatthu (5 types Rūpa Kalāpa = 46 types Rūpa) is the cause, Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

2. Object (the new state of existence is the ārammaṇa) is the cause, Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

3. (i) Bhavaṅga Manosamphassa (34) is the cause, Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

(ii) Manodvārāvajjana Manosamphassa (12-Vedanā=11) is the cause, Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

**Explanation**

1. **VATTHU:** Vedanākkhandhā can arise only when it gets to be dependent upon Hadaya Vatthu.
   At that time, as Āhāraja Rūpa cannot arise yet, then without Āhāraja Rūpa Kalāpa it is 46.
2. **OBJECT:** If one is a female, then it takes the new female state of existence as object.
   If one is a male, then it takes the new male state of existence as object.
   It experiences the feeling of that new state of existence ārammaṇa.

3. **PHASSA:** Only when that new state of existence ārammaṇa appears in the Bhavaṅga = Manodvāra then the Bhavaṇga stops and Manodvārāvajjana can arise.
   If that new state of existence ārammaṇa does not appear or does not impinge on the Bhavaṅga = Manodvāra, then Manodvārāvajjana which reflects and decides on that new state of existence cannot arise.
   Furthermore, when that new state of existence ārammaṇa impinges on Bhavaṅga = Mind Clear Element, the Nāma dhamma where Phassa (= Bhavaṅga Manosamphassa) is predominant stopped after quivering.
   (These are Bhavaṅga Calana-Bhavaṅgupaccheda).

Only when these Bhavaṅga Nāma dhamma ceased, then Manodvārāvajjana Nāma dhamma can arise.
In other words, Bhavaṅga Nāma dhamma support after having perished away so that Manodvārāvajjana can arise.
Supporting like that is mentioned as &#39;supporting by means of Anantara Satti&#39;.
Therefore, Bhavaṅga Manosamphassa also helps to support the arising of Manodvārāvajjana Nāma dhamma which includes Manodvārāvajjana Vedanākkhandhā.
That is why Bhavaṅga Manosamphassa (34) is also a cause of Manodvārāvajjana Vedanākkhandhā.

Furthermore, there is Phassa among the Manodvārāvajjana Nāma dhamma group of 12. It is Manodvārāvajjana Manosamphassa.
Only when that Phassa connects between the new state of existence ārammaṇa (object) and consciousness, then Manodvārāvajjana Nāma dhamma group can arise.
(Take note that the method is the same for further cases).
Therefore two types of Phassa are shown.
Bhavaṇga Manosamphassa is the Anantara cause, while Manodvārāvajjana Manosamphassa is the Sahajāta-Aññamañña-Nissaya...etc cause.
Although only &#39;Phassa&#39; is mentioned, understand that it means the Nāma dhamma group where Phassa is predominant.
If subtract the effect, Vedanā, from the 12 Nāma dhamma in Manodvārāvajjana, then the remaining 11 Nāma dhamma are Manodvārāvajjana Manosamphassa.

It is in accordance with such teachings as &quot;yampidaṁ manosamphassa paccayā uppajjati vedayitaṁ sukhaṁ vā dukkhaṁ vā adukkhamasukhaṁ vā tampi aniccaṁ...etc&quot;, taught in Āditta Pariyāya Sutta and &quot;phassasamudayā vedanā samudayo&quot;.

**Manodvārāvajjana - Saññākkhandhā**

1. Vatthu (5 types Rūpa Kalāpa = 46 types Rūpa) is the cause, Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

2. Object (the new state of existence is the ārammaṇa) is the cause, Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

3. (i) Bhavaṅga Manosamphassa (34) is the cause, Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

(ii) Manodvārāvajjana Manosamphassa (12-Saññā=11) is the cause, Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

**Manodvārāvajjana - Saṅkhārakkhandhā (Cetanā - 1st Way)**

1. Vatthu (5 types Rūpa Kalāpa = 46 types Rūpa) is the cause, Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

2. Object (the new state of existence is the ārammaṇa) is the cause, Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

3. (i) Bhavaṅga Manosamphassa (34) is the cause, Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

(ii) Manodvārāvajjana Manosamphassa (12-Cetanā=11) is the cause, Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

**Manodvārāvajjana - Saṅkhārakkhandhā (9 Nāma Dhamma - 2nd Way)**

1. Vatthu (5 types Rūpa Kalāpa = 46 types Rūpa) is the cause, Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

2. Object (the new state of existence is the ārammaṇa) is the cause, Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

3. (i) Bhavaṅga Manosamphassa (34) is the cause, Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

(ii) The remaining three Nāma Khandhā is the cause, Saṅkhārakkhandhā is the effect.

**Manodvārāvajjana - Viññāṇakkhandhā**

1. Bhavaṅga Manosamphassa (34) is the cause, Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

2. NāmāRūpa is the cause, Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

(In this case, &#39;Nāma&#39; means the 11 Cetasika; &#39;Rūpa&#39; means the Basis Vatthu Rūpa and the object Rūpa which is part of the new state of existence).

**5 Khandhā In Bhava Nikantika Lobha Javana**

1. The Basis Vatthu Rūpa (5 = 46) which exist in Hadaya is Rūpakkhandhā.

2. The Vedanā present in Javana is Vedanākkhandhā.

3. The Saññā present in Javana is Saññākkhandhā.

4. The Cetanā present in Javana is Saṅkhārakkhandhā (1st way);

The remaining Cetasika present in Javana is Saṅkhārakkhandhā (2nd way).

5. The consciousness, Viññāṇa present in Javana is Viññāṇakkhandhā.

(NOTES: These Bhava Nikantika Lobha Javana Nāma dhamma group are the Lobha-Diṭṭhi group Nāma dhamma.
They may arise as 20 or 19 or 22 or 21 Nāma dhamma accordingly.
In Saṅkhārakkhandhā of the 2nd way, it may be 17 or 16 or 19 or 18 Nāma accordingly.
After having linked the causal relationships, discern the Rūpakkandhā which is the Basis of this Bhava Nikantika Lobha Javana in the same way as in the Rūpakkhandhā of Manodvārāvajjana.)

**Bhava Nikantika Lobha (1st) Javana - Vedanākkhandhā**

1. Vatthu (5=46 in Hadaya) is the cause, Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

2. Object (the new state of existence is the ārammaṇa) is the cause, Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

3. (i) Bhavaṅga Manosamphassa (34) is the cause, Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

(ii) Javana Manosamphassa (20-Vedanā=19) is the cause, Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

4. Ayoniso Manasikāra (12) is the cause, Vedanākkhandha is the effect.

(NOTES: In this case Ayoniso Manasikāra means giving attention wrongly as &#39;female life&#39; or &#39;male life&#39;.
If knowing the new state of existence just attained as &#39;NāmaRūpa&#39; or &#39;causes and effects&#39; or &#39;Anicca&#39; or &#39;Dukkha&#39; or &#39;Anatta&#39;, then that knowing is right.
It is right attention.
Without knowing and giving attention like that but gives attention as &#39;female life&#39; or &#39;male life&#39; then it is Ayoniso Manasikāra, wrong attention.
Take note that it is the Manodvārāvajjana that arise just preceding to the Bhava Nikantika Lobha Javana, or in other words, the Adhimokkha cetasika which is part of that Manodvārāvajjana Nāma dhamma group which is called Yoniso Manasikāra or Ayoniso Manasikāra.
Here, it is the wrong decision of Adhimokkha as &#39;female life&#39; or &#39;male life&#39;.
As Adhimokkha cannot arise by itself singly but can arise only together with the associate Sampayutta dhamma, take note that in this case &#39;12&#39; Nāma dhamma -- which are Adhimokkha together with all Sampayutta dhamma -- are referred as Ayoniso Manasikāra.
Ayoniso Manasikāra is a proximate cause to produce Akusala Javana.

**Bhava Nikantika Lobha (1st) Javana - Saññākkhandhā**

1. Vatthu (5=46 in Hadaya) is the cause, Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

2. Object (the new state of existence is the ārammaṇa) is the cause, Saññākhandhā is the effect.

3. (i) Bhavaṅga Manosamphassa (34) is the cause, Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

(ii) Javana Manosamphassa (20- Saññā=19) is the cause, Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

4. Ayoniso Manasikāra (12) is the cause, Saññākkhandhā is the effect.

**Significant Points**

Subsequent to this Vīthi, Manodvāra Vīthi mind processes can occur according to conditions.
Understand that, after having linked their causal relationships, the discernment of the 5 Khandhā of every mind moment within those Manodvāra Vīthi mind processes are based on the method for discerning Dhammārammaṇa line.
After the faculties are completed, Pañcadvāra Vīthi &amp; Manodvāra Vīthi will arise accordingly, throughout the whole life.
The method for discerning the Rūpārammaṇa line, after having linked their causal relationships, will be shown as an example.

Āhāraja Rūpa can begin to arise when food eaten by the mother spreads to the foetus.
Therefore the discernment of causes and effects in Bhavaṇga 5 Khandhā will be shown again.

&#39;Rūpa&#39; = Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa together with 54 types of Rūpa and Rūpārammaṇa.

**Javanapaṭipādaka - Manasikāra**

If the decision of this Votthapana on the object is of such type: &#39;pleasant (iṭṭha)&#39;, &#39;unpleasant (aniṭṭha)&#39;...etc., then -- as it is wrong attention = Ayoniso Manasikāra -- Akusala Javana will arise accordingly.
However, Votthapana in Pañcadvāra Vīthi cannot actually decide that the object is pleasant, unpleasant, permanent, happiness, atta, beautiful...etc (iṭṭha, aniṭṭha, nicca, sukha, atta, subha...etc).
After having decided on the object as pleasant, unpleasant, permanent, happiness, atta, beautiful...etc for many times by preceding Manodvāra Vīthis, then -- as the arising of the subsequent Pañcadvāra Vīthis are supported by those preceding Manodvāra Vīthis by means of powerful dependence, Upanissaya paccayasatti -- the Votthapana included in those subsequent Pañcadvāra Vīthis arise as if deciding that the object is pleasant, unpleasant, permanent, happiness, atta, beautiful...etc.
This is Ayoniso Manasikāra.
With that Ayoniso Manasikāra as the fundamental cause, Akusala Javanas arise subsequent to that Votthapana.
Furthermore, if the decision of Votthapana is of such types as &#39;Rupārammaṇa-Colour&#39;...etc., then -- as it is Yoniso Manasikāra -- Kusala Javana will arise subsequent to that Votthapana.
In this case also, take note that Votthapana cannot actually decide; but is as if deciding.
Therefore, Votthapana is called JavanaPaṭipādaka Manasikāra = the attention on the object which is the fundamental cause of Javana (Abhidhamma Commentary-Vol.1-pg.177 Burmese script).
Here the discernment in Kusala Javanas, after having linked the causal relationships, which has Yoniso Manasikāra as the fundamental cause will be shown first.

(The above are from the new guide book while the followings are from the old guide book under the same heading:)

If the decision of the Votthapana decides it as &#39;permanent-happiness-atta-beautiful..etc&#39;, then -- as that is wrong attention = Ayoniso Manasikāra -- subsequent to the Votthapana, Akusala Javana will occur.
If the decision of Votthapana decides it as &#39;Rūpārammaṇa-Colour...etc&#39;, then -- as it is Yoniso Manasikāra -- Kusala Javana will occur subsequent to the Votthapana.
Therefore Votthapana is called JavanaPaṭipādaka Manasikāra = the attention which is the fundamental cause of Javana.
The discernment in Kusala Javana, having linked the causal relationships, which fundamental cause is Yoniso Manasikāra will be shown first.

**Rūpārammaṇa = Colour Line Kusala 1st Javana 5 Khandhā**

5. The consciousness Viññāṇa in the 1st Javana 34 Nāma dhamma is Viññāṇakkhandhā.

(NOTES: Discern the above Kusala 1st Javana Rūpakkhandhā as in the Pañcadvārāvajjana Rūpakkhandhā.
As Javana Nāma dhamma are not produced by past causes but is produced by present causes only, there is no past causes in Javana Nāma dhamma; only present causes exist.)

(NOTES: If there is Upekkhā Vedanā in Javana then Pīti is not included; subtract Pīti from the above 34, as the case may be.
If there is no Ñāṇa, then subtract Ñāṇa.
If both Ñāṇa and Pīti are not included, then subtract both.
Except Vedanā-Saññā-Viññāṇa, the remaining Cetasika, be it a few or many, are called Saṅkhārakkhandhā.

As for the 2nd Javana -- as the Buddha taught in Paṭṭhāna that **Purimā purimā kusalā dhammā pacchimānaṁ pacchimānaṁ kusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ anantara paccayena paccayo...** etc (Paṭṭhāna-Vol.1-pg.3 Burmese script) -- the preceding Javana is the Anantara cause of the subsequent Javana.
In other words, **Yesaṁ yesaṁ dhammānaṁ anantarā ye ye dhammā uppajjanti citta-cetasikā dhammā, te te dhammā tesaṁ tesaṁ dhammānaṁ anantarapaccayena paccayo** (Paṭṭhāna-Vol.1-pg.3 Burmese script) -- in accordance with this teaching, the preceding Citta = the preceding Nāma dhamma group is the Anantara cause of the subsequent Citta = the subsequent Nāma dhamma group.
One must also discern the Anantara cause in 2nd Javana...etc and Tadārammaṇas.
If that is so, one may ask &quot;Isn&#39;t there Anantara cause for the 1st Javana?&quot;.
There is.
Votthapana is the Anantara cause of 1st Javana.
However, as Votthapana is called Yoniso Manasikāra here, it is not mentioned again.
In the following only Mahā Kusala 2nd Javana Vedanākkhandhā will be shown as an example.
Discern the remaining Nāma Khandhā and the remaining Javanas and Tadārammaṇa base on this method.
Do not forget that it is to discern after having grouped into 5 Khandhas in every Javana mind moment, as well as every Tadārammaṇa mind moment.)

Discern Tadārammaṇa Rūpakkhandhā in the same way as Pañcadvārāvajjana Rūpakkhandhā.

**Mahā Vipāka 1st Tadārammaṇa - Vedanākkhandhā**

The five past causes:

1. Avijjā (=20) is the cause, 1st Tadārammaṇa Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

(iii) 1st Tadārammaṇa Manosamphassa (34-Vedanā=33) is the cause, 1st Tadārammaṇa Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

Discernment for the remaining Nāma Khandhā will be the same as Vedanākkhandhā except for the following differences:

In 1st Tadārammaṇa Saññākkhandhā No.
8(iii) it is 1st Tadārammaṇa Manosamphassa =34-Saññā=33.
In 1st Tadārammaṇa Saṅkhārakkhandhā No.
8(iii) it is 1st Tadārammaṇa Manosamphassa =34-Cetanā=33 (1st way).

In 1st Tadārammaṇa Saṅkhārakkhandhā No.
8(iii) it is the remaining three Nāma Khandhā (=Vedanā, Saññā and Viññāṇa).

**Mahā Vipāka 1st Tadārammaṇa - Viññāṇakkhandhā**

(Discern the causes from 1 to 5 as in Vedanākkhandhā.)

6. (i) Cakkhusamphassa (8) is the cause, 1st Tadārammaṇa Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

(ii) 7th Javana Manosamphassa (=34) is the cause, 1st Tadārammaṇa Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

7. 1st Tadārammaṇa NāmaRūpa is the cause, 1st Tadārammaṇa Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

&#39;Nāma&#39; = the accompanying 33 Cetasika; &#39;Rūpa&#39; = Basis Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa together with 54 types of Rūpa and the Rūpārammaṇa.

If the MahāVipāka Tadārammaṇa is of Upekkhā Vedanā then Pīti is not included; it is 33 Nāma dhammas.
If it is not accompanied by Ñāṇa, then as Ñāṇa is not included it is 33 Nāma dhamma.
If both Ñāṇa and Pīti are not accompanying then it is 32 Nāma dhamma.
The differences in the quantity of Cetasika is according to whether it is Somanassa or Upekkhā or Ñāṇasampayutta or Ñāṇavippayutta.
In Saṅkhārakkhandhā 2nd way the quantity of Cetasika may be increased or decreased accordingly.
If the Tadārammaṇa is Ahetuka Kusala Vipāka SomanassaSantīraṇa Tadārammaṇa then there are 12 Nāma dhamma.
If it is Ahetuka KusalaVipāka UpekkhāSantīraṇa Tadārammaṇa, then there are 11 Nāma dhamma.
If it is Ahetuka Tadārammaṇa then the quantity of Cetasika in Saṅkhārakkhandhā 2nd way can vary.
Discern base on these methods.
As the Anantara cause of the 2nd Tadārammaṇa is the 1st Tadārammaṇa, in the Manosamphassa which is cause No.
8(ii), the quantity of Nāma dhamma can be changed accordingly as 34 or 33, or 33 or 32, or 12 or 11, or 11. Bear it in mind and discern base on these methods.

**Manodvāra Vīthis Which Take Rūpārammaṇa As Object**

The methods of discerning causal relationships in the 5 Khandhā of every Vīthi mind moment in Kusala Javana Cakkhudvāra Vīthi are now already shown as an example.
Based on these methods one should be able to discern the causes and effects in other Kusala Javana Cakkhudvāra Vīthis Nāma dhamma groups in the same way.
Then, subsequent to Cakkhudvāra Vīthi, after Bhavaṅgas occurred in between, the ManodvāraVīthi mind processes which continue to take Rūpārammaṇa as the object arise.
In this case, discern the Bhavaṅga 5 Khandhā in the same way as in the Bhavaṅga 5 Khandhā mentioned earlier.
Only the Vedanākkhandhā of Manodvārāvajjana and Javana will be further shown as an example.
The grouping of the 5 Khandhā in Manodvārāvajjana is similar to the grouping of the 5 Khandhā in Votthapana.
The grouping of the 5 Khandhā in Javana and Tadārammaṇa is similar to the grouping of the 5 Khandhā in Cakkhudvāra Vīthi Javana and Tadārammaṇa.

**Manodvārāvajjana - Vedanākkhandhā**

**Explanations**

_Yampidaṁ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṁ sukhaṁ vā dukkhaṁ vā adukkhamasukahaṁ va_ (Saṁyutta Nikāya-Vol.2-pg.248 Burmese script).

_Cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitanti cakkhusamphassaṁ mūlapaccayaṁ katvā uppannā sampaṭicchana-santīraṇa-voṭṭhabbana-javanavedanā.
Cakkhuviññāṇasampayuttāya pana vattabbameva natthi.
Sotadvārādivedanāpaccayādīsupi eseva nayo_ (Saṁyutta Commentary-Vol.3-pg.5).

_Yampidaṁ manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṁ sukhaṁ vā dukkhaṁ vā adukkhamasukhaṁ vā_ (Saṁyutta-Vol.2-pg.248).

_Manosamphassoti bhavaṅgasahajāto samphasso.
Vedayitanti javanasahajātā vedanā.
Sahāvajjanena bhavaṅgasahajātāpi vaṭṭati yeva..._

_Yamidaṁ = (yampidaṁ) cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedanāgataṁ saññāgataṁ saṅkhāragataṁ viññāṇagataṁ_ (Majjhima Nikāya-Vol.3-pg.325 Burmese script).

_Yamidaṁ manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedanāgataṁ saññāgataṁ saṅkhāragataṁ viññāṇagataṁ_ (Majjhima Nikāya-Vol.3-pg.326 Burmese script).

_Sahāvajjanavedanāya javanavedanā &quot;vedayita&quot;nti adhippetā._

_Bhavaṅgasampayuttāya pana vedanāya gahaṇe vattabbameva natthi_ (Saṁyutta sub-commentary Ṭīka-Vol.2-pg.286).

In accordance with the above Pāḷi Text, commentary and sub-commentary, the Vedanas of CakkhuViññāṇa, Sampaṭicchana, Santīraṇa, Voṭṭhabbana, Javana and Tadārammaṇa which arise having Cakkhusamphassa as the fundamental cause are Cakkhusamphassapaccayā vedanā.
In accordance with Cuḷa Rahulovāda Sutta mentioned above, Cakkhusamphassa produce not just Vedanā only but all 4 Nāma Khandhā which are Vedanā, Saññā, Saṅkhāra and Viññāṇa -- Yamidaṁ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedanāgataṁ saññāgataṁ saṅkhāragataṁ viññāṇagataṁ.
Therefore take note that the Cakkhusamphassa accompanying CakkhuViññāṇa supports so that the 4 Nāma Khandhā of each respective CakkhuViññāṇa, Sampaṭicchana, Santīraṇa, Votthapana, Javana and Tadārammaṇa arises.
Although the Commentary mentioned that in Cakkhusamphassa supporting the Nāma dhamma produced by Cakkhusamphassa, it supports only in SamānaVīthi = same Vīthi = Cakkhudvāra Vīthi, the Commentary also did not reject that -- &quot;Cakkhusamphassapaccayā vedanākkhandho atthi anupādinna anupādāniyo asaṁkiliṭṭha asaṁkilesiko avitakka avicāro&quot; -- Cakkhusamphassa supports Nānā = different Vīthi = the Manodvāra Vīthi which continue to take the Rūpārammaṇa as object.
As the supporting of Cakkhusamphassa to the Nāma dhamma group in the SamānaVīthi = same Vīthi = Cakkhudvāra Vīthi is certain, the Commentary mentioned that Cakkhusamphassa support the Cakkhudvāra Vīthi Nāma dhamma group (Mūla Tīka-Vol.2-pg.30).
The research on meditators supports the explanation of the sub-commentary.
Take note that it is similar that Sotasamphassa support Sotadvāra Vīthi and Manodvāra Vīthi which take Saddārammaṇa as object.

**MANOSAMPHASSA:** - The Phassa accompanying with the Bhavaṅga close to Manodvārāvajjana which support the Manodvārāvajjana by means of Anantara Satti is Manosamphassa.
This Manosamphassa also supports so that the Manodvāra Vīthi Nāma dhamma group, which are Manodvārāvajjana-Javana-(Tadārammaṇa), arise.
If it is Appanā Vīthi, the Manosamphassa support so that Manodvārāvajjana and Upācāra Samādhi Javana-Appanā Javana arise.
Therefore it is shown that Cakkhusamphassa, Bhavaṇga Manosamphassa and the Sampayutta Manosamphassa support the Manodvāra Vīthi Nāma dhamma group which take Rūpārammaṇa as object are shown.
In 2nd Javana...etc., the Anantara Manosamphassa causes are added.

That being so, discern the causes and effects, after having seen by insight the causal relationships between the causes and effects in Cakkhusamphassa, Anantara Manosamphassa and SahajātaSampayutta Manosamphassa supporting the appropriate Nāma Khandhā; as well as in the support by Cakkhusamphassa, Bhavaṅga Manosamphassa, Anantara Manosamphassa and SahajātaSampayutta Manosamphassa in Manodvārika Nāma dhamma group which continue to take the Rūpārammaṇa as object.

Now the discernment of causes and effects by the 5 Khandhā method in every mind moment of the Cakkhudvāra- and Manodvāra- Akusala Javana Vīthis which take Rūpārammaṇa as object will be further shown.

**Rūpārammaṇa Colour Line - Akusala Group**

In the Cakkhudvāra and Manodvāra Akusala Vīthis which take Rūpārammaṇa as the object, the discernment of Pañcadvārāvajjana, Cakkhu Viññāṇa, Sampaṭicchana, Santīraṇa, Votthapana, Tadārammaṇa, (Bhavaṅga), Manodvārāvajjana...etc are the same with the discernment of Kusala Javana Vīthis.
As there are a little differences in Javana only, the Lobha-Diṭṭhi group (20 Nāma dhamma) will be shown as an example.
In the Akusala Javana Nāma dhamma group, like the Kusala Javana Nāma dhamma group, there is no past cause; there is only present causes.

**Rūpārammaṇa = Colour Line: (Lobha-Diṭṭhi Group) Javana - 5 Khandhā**

1. The 54 types of Rūpa which include the Basis Hadaya Vatthu of Javana and the Rūpārammaṇa are Rūpakkhandhā.

2. The Vedanā in the Lobha-Diṭṭhi group Javana 20 Nāma dhamma is Vedanākkhandhā.

3. The Saññā in the Lobha-Diṭṭhi group Javana 20 Nāma dhamma is Saññākkhandhā.

4. The Cetanā in the Lobha-Diṭṭhi group Javana 20 Nāma dhamma is Saṅkhārakkhandhā (1st way).

The remaining 17 Cetasika in the Lobha-Diṭṭhi group Javana 20 Nāma dhamma is Saṅkhārakkhandhā (2nd way).

5. The consciousness Viññāṇa in the Lobha-Diṭṭhi group Javana 20 Nāma dhamma is Viññāṇakkhandhā.

Discern the Javana Rūpakkhandhā base on the methods in Pañcadvārāvajjana Rūpakkhandhā.

**Lobha-Diṭṭhi Group 1st Javana - Vedanākkhandhā**

**(Cakkhudvāra Vīthi)**

The four present causes:

1. Vatthu = HadayaVatthu Rūpa (=54) is the cause, 1st Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

2. Object (=Rūpārammaṇa) is the cause, 1st Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

3. (i) Cakkhusamphassa (8) is the cause, 1st Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

(ii) 1st Javana Manosamphassa (20-Vedanā=19) is the cause, 1st Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

4. Ayoniso Manasikāra (= Votthapana = 12) is the cause, 1st Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

(If the attention and decision of the Votthapana on Rūpārammaṇa is as &#39;permanent or happy or atta or beautiful...etc&#39;, then -- as it is Ayoniso Manasikāra -- Akusala Javana will occur accordingly.)

**Lobha-Diṭṭhi Group 1st Javana - Viññāṇakkhandhā**

**(Cakkhudvāra Vīthi)**

1. Cakkhusamphassa (8) is the cause, 1st Javana Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

2. NāmaRūpa is the cause, 1st Javana Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

3. Ayoniso Manasikāra(= Votthapana = 12) is the cause, 1st Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

&#39;Nāma&#39; = the accompanying 19 Cetasika; &#39;Rūpa&#39; = 54 types of Rūpa which include the Basis Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa; and the Rūpārammaṇa.

**Lobha-Diṭṭhi Group 2nd Javana - Vedanākkhandhā**

**(Cakkhudvāra Vīthi)**

The four present causes:

1. Vatthu = HadayaVatthu Rūpa (=54) is the cause, 2nd Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

2. Object (=Rūpārammaṇa) is the cause, 2nd Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

4. Ayoniso Manasikāra (= Votthapana = 12) is the cause, 2nd Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

**Lobha-Diṭṭhi Group 2nd Javana - Viññāṇakkhandhā**

**(Cakkhudvāra Vīthi)**

The three present causes:

1. (i) Cakkhusamphassa (8) is the cause, 2nd Javana Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

(ii) 1st Javana Manosamphassa (20) is the cause, 2nd Javana Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

2. Nāma+Rūpa is the cause, 2nd Javana Viññāṇakkhandhā is the effect.

3. Ayoniso Manasikāra(= Votthapana = 12) is the cause, 2nd Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

&#39;Nāma&#39; = the accompanying 19 Cetasika; &#39;Rūpa&#39; = 54 types of Rūpa which include the Basis Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa; and the Rūpārammaṇa.

**Take Note Of These**

One can understand the discernment of the causes and effects by 5 Khandhā method in every mind moment in the Akusala Javana Vīthis which are Cakkhudvāra Vīthi and Manodvāra Vīthi in the Rūpārammaṇa line, linking the causal relationships based on the above methods.
If the meditator understands the said discernment for both the Kusala Javana Vīthi and Akusala Javana Vīthi in Rūpārammaṇa line then he can change to discern another line such as Saddārammaṇa line.
It is assumed that the meditator will be able to understand the increasing or decreasing of the quantity of Cetasika according to the number of accompanying Cetasika.
Take note that according to quantity of accompanying Cetasika in each mind moment, there are changes in Saṅkhārakkhandhā and Sahajāta Manosamphassa.
If the meditator has only little basic knowledge of Abhidhamma or has not study Abhidhamma before, then the help of a teacher is necessary.
Therefore, some of the differences will be shown.

**Changes**

2. In Saddārammaṇa line: as for &#39;Object&#39;, change it to Saddārammaṇa in place of Rūpārammaṇa; and as for &#39;Cakkhusamphassa&#39; change it to Sotasamphassa.

3. In Gandhārammaṇa line: in &#39;Object&#39;, change it to Gandhārammaṇa; and in &#39;Phassa&#39; change it to Ghānasamphassa.

4. In Rasārammaṇa line: in &#39;Object&#39;, change it to Rasārammaṇa; and in &#39;Phassa&#39; change it to Jivhāsamphassa.

5. In Phoṭṭhabbārammaṇa line: in &#39;Object&#39;, change it to Phoṭṭhabbārammaṇa; and in &#39;Phassa&#39; change it to Kāyasamphassa.

**Saddārammaṇa = Sound Line: Pañcadvārāvajjana - Vedanākkhandhā**

The three present causes:

1. Vatthu = Hadaya Vatthu Rūpa (= 54) is the cause, Pañcadvārāvajjana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

2. Object (= Saddārammaṇa) is the cause, Pañcadvārāvajjana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

3. (i) Bhavaṅga Manosamphassa (34) is the cause, Pañcadvārāvajjana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

(ii) Pañcadvārāvajjana Manosamphassa (11-Vedanā=10) is the cause, Pañcadvārāvajjana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

To this extent, the meditator can understand it for the remaining Nāma Khandhā.
Only one or two Khandhās in some mind moment will be further shown so as to know the method.
However at the time of meditation it is to discern all 5 Khandhā in every mind moment completely.

**Saddārammaṇa = Sound Line: SotaViññāṇa (= Hearing) - Vedanākkhandhā**

10. Manasikāra = Pañcadvārāvajjana = 11 is the cause, SotaViññāṇa Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

{ **ĀKĀSA:** There must be Ākāsa = space between Sota Pasāda and Saddārammaṇa.
Only if that Ākāsa dhātu is being dependent upon then SotaViññāṇa can come to arise.
Without that Ākāsa dhātu then SotaViññāṇa cannot arise.
It is right that in the one whose ears are blocked or being blocked SotaViññāṇa cannot arise.
Therefore Ākāsa dhātu is also one of the causes for the arising of SotaViññāṇa Nāma dhamma group.

**ĀPO-DHĀTU:** JivhāViññāṇa and Sampayutta dhamma group can arise only when there is ĀpoDhātu, water which wets the tongue.
They cannot arise without ApoDhātu, water.
Although you put dried edibles on the dried tongue of the person with dried tongue, JivhāViññāṇa cannot arise (Abhidhamma Commentary-Vol.1-pg.322 Burmese script).

Among the present causes of Viññāṇakkhandhā in JivhāViññāṇa, take the appropriate accompanying Cetasika as &#39;Nāma&#39; and take the appropriate Basis Vatthu Rūpa and Rasārammaṇa as &#39;Rūpa&#39;.

10. Manasikāra = Pañcadvārāvajjana = 11 is the cause, KāyaViññāṇa Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

{ **PATHAVĪ-DHĀTU:** When Phoṭṭhabbārammaṇa impinges on Kāya Pasāda = Body Transparent Element, it impinges not only on the Kāya Pasāda but also on the Great Elements in the same Kalāpa which are the Dependence, the Nissaya cause, of KāyaPasāda.
Out of these Great Elements in the same Kalāpa, Pathavī-Dhātu is the main cause of Kāya Pasāda.
KāyaViññāṇa can arise only when it gets to be dependent upon Pathavī Dhātu which is the real fundamental cause of Kāya Pasāda.
It cannot arise without Pathavī dhātu.
It is true that as the external Great Elements object (= external Pathavī, Tejo, Vāyo) impinges on the internal Kāya Pasāda, the Great Elements of the same Kalāpa -- i.e.
the Basis which are the causes of KāyaPasāda -- are also being impinged upon.
Therefore Pathavī Dhātu is one of the causes of the arising of KāyaViññāṇa (Abhidhamma Commentary-Vol.1-pg.322).}

Among the present causes of Viññāṇakkhandhā in the &#39;NāmaRūpa&#39; cause, take the appropriate accompanying Cetasika as &#39;Nāma&#39; and take the 44 types of Rūpa dhamma which are together with Kāya Vatthu Rūpa and the object Rūpa which are Pathavī, Tejo &amp; Vāyo called Phoṭṭhabbārammaṇa as &#39;Rūpa&#39;.

4. Yoniso Manasikāra (= Votthapana = 12) is the cause, 2nd Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

**Dhammārammaṇa Line - 1st Jhāna Samāpatti Vīthi**

**(Ānāpāna Paṭibhāga Nimitta As Object)**

**1st Javana - Vedanākkhandhā**

The four present causes:

1. Vatthu = HadayaVatthu Rūpa (=54) is the cause, 1st Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

2. Object (=Ānāpāna Paṭibhāga Nimitta as object) is the cause, 1st Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

3. (i) Bhavaṅga Manosamphassa (34) is the cause, 1st Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

(ii) 1st Javana Manosamphassa (34-Vedanā=33) is the cause, 1st Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

4. Yoniso Manasikāra (= Manodvārāvajjana = 12) is the cause, 1st Javana Vedanākkhandhā is the effect.

The only difference in 2nd Javana and etc...
is that there is one more cause, that is the Anantara cause which is the preceding Nāma dhamma such as the 1st Javana Nāma dhamma cause for the 2nd Javana ...etc.

In the &#39;NāmaRūpa&#39; cause of this Jhāna Samāpatti Vīthi Javana Viññāṇakkhandhā take only the 54 types of Rūpa that include Hadaya Vatthu which is the Basis Vatthu Rūpa as &#39;Rūpa&#39;; the object, which is Ānāpāna Paṭibhāga Nimitta, is a Paññatti object.
In discerning the causes and effects in the Jhāna Nāma dhamma which takes a Samatha Nimitta as object such as Skeleton Paṭibhāga Nimitta or White Kasiṇa Paṭibhāga Nimitta, after having linked the causal relationships by insight, in the &#39;Object&#39; cause change it to the object of the Jhāna Nāma dhamma group which one is discerning.
For example, change it to &#39; White Kasiṇa Paṭibhāga Nimitta as object&#39;.
As there are 34 Nāma dhamma in 1st Jhāna; 32 in 2nd Jhāna; 31 in 3rd Jhāna; and 31 in 4th Jhāna respectively, in the &#39;Javana Manosamphassa&#39; cause, decrease the quantity of Cetasika accordingly.
Tadārammaṇa does not arise subsequent to Appanā Javana = Jhāna Javana.

**Dhammārammaṇa Line - Rūpa Dhamma As Object**

Among the Rūpa dhamma that are part of Dhammārammaṇa line which are Pasāda Rūpa = 5 Transparent Rūpa and Sukhuma Rūpa = 16 subtle Rūpa, when the meditator takes any one of those Rūpa as object, if there is Yoniso Manasikāra then Kusala Javana will arise; if there is Ayoniso Manasikāra then Akusala Javana will arise accordingly.
If pay attention to it as &#39;Rūpa dhamma&#39; or &#39;Anicca&#39; or &#39;Dukkha&#39; or &#39;Anatta&#39; or &#39;Asubha&#39; or &#39;Eye Transparent Element&#39;...etc then it is Yoniso Manasikāra.
Concerning the arising of Ayoniso Manasikāra, refer to that in Nāma Kammaṭṭhāna.
The arising of the 10 Saṁyojana are already explained then.
The remaining causes are the same (as above).
To this extent it is sufficient to understand the linking of causes and effects in Akusala Javana Vīthi.
If Tadārammaṇa arises then discern it base on the Tadārammaṇa discernment mentioned earlier.

**Partially**

Having grouped into 5 Khandhās, discern the causes and effects in every mind moment of Kusala Javana Vīthi and Akusala Javana Vīthi in all 6 lines which are Rūpārammaṇa line, Saddārammaṇa line, Gandhārammaṇa line, Rasārammaṇa line, Phoṭṭhabbārammaṇa line and Dhammārammaṇa line by 5 Khandhā method, after having linked the causal relationships.
In discerning like that, it is mentioned in Visuddhimagga that -- Vipassakena pana kammantarañca vipākantarañca ekadesato jānitabbaṁ (Vism.-Ch.XIX-17) -- one must further discern to realise some of the Kamma and their effects.
Not every Pavatti Vipāka Viññāṇa (which are PañcaViññāṇa, Sampaṭicchana, Santīraṇa and Tadārammaṇa) existing in the 6 types of Vīthi such as Cakkhudvāra Vīthi is produced by the same Kamma that produces Paṭisandhi-Bhavaṅga-Cuti Vipāka Viññāṇa.
Only some of the Pavatti Vipāka Viññāṇa are produced by the Kamma which produces Paṭisandhi-Bhavaṅga-Cuti Vipāka dhammas.
There are also some other Pavatti Vipāka Viññāṇa which are not produced by that Kamma.
Refer to the 12 Vipāka of Buddha.
Therefore, the meditator is to discern the past 5 Khandhā thoroughly.
In discerning like that, if the meditator happened to discern some Kusala Kamma and some Akusala Kamma, then he is discern also the good effects or bad effects which occurred during the duration of life (Pavatti) in this present life, linking the causal relationships.

**Externally And Towards The Successive Pasts &amp; Successive Futures**

After having linked the causal relationships and having discerned the causes and effects in all 6 lines as mentioned above between the past 5 causes and present effects, then discern externally (Bahiddha) in the same way based on those methods.
However, as they are the same externally, discern them as a whole.

If successful, then having sent the mind towards the successive pasts, discern the causes and effects such as 2nd past life causes and 1st past life effects; 3rd past life causes and 2nd past life effects...etc.
Similarly discern the present causes and future effects, after having linked the causal relationships.
Having sent the insight towards the successive futures until the last future discern the causes and effects as far as possible.
Discern externally similarly as in the discernment of causes and effects internally in the three periods of Past-Present-Future.

**Caraṇa &#39;Seed&#39; And Vijja &#39;Seed&#39;**

In discerning like that, discern by insight emphasising on the Caraṇa &#39;seeds&#39; and Vijja &#39;seeds&#39; done and fulfilled in past lives with the aspiration for attainment of Nibbāna such as:

1. Dāna, Sīla and Samatha practices which were Caraṇa &#39;seeds&#39;,

2. (i) had discerned 4 Great Elements,

(ii) had discerned Rūpa dhamma until attainment of ultimate reality,

(iii) had discerned Nāma dhamma until attainment of ultimate reality,

(iv) had discerned Rūpa-Nāma until attainment of ultimate reality,

(v) had discerned causes and effects,

(vi) had meditated Vipassanā on the 3 Characteristics of Rūpa-Nāma-causes-effects which were some of the Vijja &#39;seeds&#39;.

Also discern by insight that those Caraṇa &#39;seeds&#39; and Vijja &#39;seeds&#39; are supporting successively by means Upatthambhaka Satti and Janaka Satti.

**Anantara Cause Of Bhavaṅga**

The mind which is arising as the cause of life so that the mental process continuity does not break in one life is called Bhavaṅga.
It is already explained earlier that Bhavaṅga is produced by the appropriate causes such as Avijjā, Taṇhā, Upādāna, Saṅkhāra, Kamma, Vatthu, Object, Phassa...etc.
As Bhavaṅga is the mind which mostly occur throughout the whole life, there may be variety of Anantara causes in Bhavaṅga.
The essential point to take note is that the mind moment which is nearest to the Bhavaṅga Citta which one is discerning is the Anantara cause; in other words, the mind moment preceding to that Bhavaṅga without interval is the Anantara cause of that Bhavaṅga.
Therefore:

1. Paṭisandhi supports the 1st Bhavaṅga by means of Anantara Paccayasatti,

2. 1st Bhavaṅga supports the 2nd Bhavaṅga by means of Anantara Paccayasatti,

3. preceding Bhavaṅga supports the subsequent Bhavaṅga by means of Anantara Paccayasatti,

4. if Bhavaṅga arise subsequent to Votthapana, then Votthapana supports that Bhavaṅga by means of Anantara Paccayasatti,

5. if Bhavaṅga arise subsequent to Javana, then the last Javana supports that Bhavaṅga by means of Anantara Paccayasatti,

6. if Bhavaṅga arise subsequent to Tadārammaṇa, then the 2nd Tadārammaṇa supports that Bhavaṅga by means of Anantara Paccayasatti.

Subsequent to Bhavaṅga if Bhavaṅga arises again, then the preceding Bhavaṅga supports the subsequent Bhavaṅga by means of Anantara paccayasatti.

**Attainment Of ÑātaPariññā**

So &quot;idaṁ nāmarūpaṁ na ahetu na appaccayā nibbattam, sahetu sappaccayā nibbattam.
Ko panassa hetu, ko pana paccayo&quot;ti upaparikkhanto &quot;Avijjāpaccayā taṇhā paccayā kammapaccayā āhārapaccayā cā&quot;ti tassa paccayaṁ vavatthapetvā &quot;atītepi paccayā ceva paccayasamuppannadhammā ca, anāgatepi etarahipi paccayā ceva paccayasamuppannadhammā ca, tato uddhaṁ satto vā puggalo vā natthi, suddhasaṅkhārapuñjā evā&quot;ti tīsu addhāsu kaṅkhaṁ viharati.
Ayaṁ pana vipassanāsaṅkhārasallakkhaṇā ñātapariññā nāma.

(Abhidhamma Commentary-Vol.2-241,242 Burmese script)

For the meditator who has already discerned the Rūpa and Nāma, i.e.
the 5 Khandhās in all 6 lines according to Āyatana dvāra completely, if he investigates and contemplates, &quot;These NāmaRūpa do not arise without Hetu cause = Janaka cause which produces directly and not without Upatthambhaka cause = Paccaya cause which supports.
They arise only because of Hetu cause = Janaka cause which produces directly and because of Upatthambhaka cause = Paccaya cause which supports.
What are the Hetu cause and Paccaya cause of these NāmaRūpa?&quot;, then he realises by insight, &quot;They arise because of causes such as Avijjā, Taṇhā, Upādāna, Saṅkhāra, Kamma, Āhāra...etc.&quot;.
Having distinguished the causes of those NāmaRūpa (such as &#39;because of the arising of Avijjā, Paṭisandhi KammajaRūpa arises.
Avijjā is the cause, Paṭisandhi KammajaRūpa Rūpakkhandhā is the effect&#39;....etc.), then Vicikiccha, the doubts on the three periods of Past-Future-Present can be eradicated by realising that:

&quot;1) There are only causes and effects in the Past;

2. there are only causes and effects in the Future;

3. there are only causes and effects in the Present also;

and apart from these causes and effects there is no Being who creates and there is no Being who is created; there are only Rūpa-Nāma-causes-effects-Saṅkhāra dhamma groups&quot;.
This is called Ñāta Pariññā, realising well the Saṅkhāra dhamma which are the object of Vipassanā insight, which are:

1. Rūpa dhamma,

2. Nāma dhamma,

3. causes,

4. effects.
   (Abhidhamma Commentary-Vol.2-241,242)

However, these Rūpa, Nāma, causes and effects - Saṅkhāra dhamma must be thoroughly discerned again by means of Lakkhana-Rasa-Paccupaṭtṭhāna-Padaṭṭhāna (characteristic-function-manifestation-proximate cause).
