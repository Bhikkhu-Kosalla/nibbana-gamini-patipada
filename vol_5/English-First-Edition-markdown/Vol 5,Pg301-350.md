### **PAGE-301**

Various knowledge of Contemplation **_(anupassanāñāṇa)_**, **_aniccānupassanā_** etc.. abandons defilement by means of temporary **_(tadanga)_**. If defilements are abandoned, **_abhisaṅkāra dhamma_**, which are capable of providing new existence, which belongs to the action round **_(kamma vaṭṭa)_** with the source of those defilement round **_(kilesa vaṭṭa)_**, have also been abandoned. Then if action-defilement are abandoned, it can be said the consequent aggregates **_(vipāka khandhā)_**, which will be occurred by that action in future, have also been abandoned.

The knowledge of Dissolution called this **_aniccānupassanā ñāṇa_** etc.. is called **_pariccāga paṭinissagga_** (= the **_dhamma_** which is able to abandon permanently defilements with aggregates, **_abhisaṅkhāra dhamma_**), due to ability to abandon defilements with aggregates, **_abhisaṅkhāra dhamma._** It can also be said as "**_pakkahandana paṭinissagga_**", due to ability to enter into the Eternal Peace, **_nibbāna_** with the nature of permanence **_(nicca)_**, happiness **_(suhka)_** which are opposite to those impermanence etc after seeing faults, impermanence etc, of conditioned things. Therefore the practising **_bhikkhu_** who has fulfilled with the knowledge of Dissolution, **_aniccānupassanā_** etc., not only abandons defilements temporarily but also enters into **_nibbāna_** through incline towards it. Defilement are not taken into heart by means of cause to arise. Due to obvious seeing on faults of defilements, occurrence of impermanence et., the object, which is conditioned things through inability to know faults of those conditioned things, occurrence of impermanence etc., is not obsessed by selfish desire and wrong view. Therefore it is said \_\_\_\_ "**_paṭinissajjati no ādiyati =_** it is abandoned, but not attached". **_(Vs-2-279)_**

These words are intended to present further explanations of commentary and subcommentary in order to be explicit the preaching of **_Paṭisambhidā Magga_**, presented as above. Now it will be continued to present explanation on four verses found in section of knowledge of Dissolution, **_Paṭisambhidā Magga_** as follows. \_\_\_\_

**3.16 Verses found in _Paṭisambhidā Magga_**

**_1. vatthu saṅkamanā ceva, paññāya ca vivaṭṭanā._**

#### ` `**_ācajjanābalañceva, paṭisaṅkha vipassanā. (Paṭisam-56)_**

\1. **_esā_** = These properties, viz.,

` `**_vatthu saṅkamana ceva_** = chifting from one kind of **_vatthu_** (= object) to another, **_vivaṭṭana ca =_** backing out of arising **_(= udaya)_** through only pure phenomenon of perishing away is kept in mind, **_āvajjanābalañceva =_** ability to advert contiguously, **_paññāya_** = of **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge which occurs by means of discerning on the phenomena of arising and passing away, **_paṭisaṅkha vipassanā_** are called contemplation of dissolution **_(bhāgānupassanā)_** which discerns only phenomenon of perishing away after knowing object of conditioned things, corporeality... etc.

In this verse, there are three terms, which are essential to be explicit, viz., **_(a) vatthu saṅkamanā (b) paññāya_** **_vivaṭṭanā (c) āvajjanabala._** It will be continue to explain one by one.

#### **_(a) vatthu saṅkamanā (= shifting of vatthu)_**

In this case, all conditioned things, from corporeal aggregate to aging-death, are designated as **_vatthu_** (=discerned object) due to occurrence of object of **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge (= standing

### **PAGE – 302**

place or object of **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge). The term, shifting of **_vatthu_**, means discerning by shifting from one kind of object to another.

**For example** \_\_\_\_ After discerning on the phenomenon of perishing away of corporeal **_dhammas_**, such consciousness discerns the phenomenon of perishing away of corporeal **_dhammas_**, by means of discerning on the phenomenon of perishing away of that consciousness, the performance of shifting is accomplished by transferring from previous object, perishing away of corporeal **_dhammas_**, to the next kind, perishing away of consciousness of **_vipassanā_** practice. **_(Vs-2-280)_**

**_saṅkamanā (= shifting)_**\_\_\_\_ Due to occurrence of impermanent **_dhammas_**, a single consciousness of **_vipassanā_** practice within one mind moment never shift from one kind of object to another as natural fixed law. By the time feeling **_dhammas_** is being discerned, the consciousness of **_vipassanā_** practice, which was discerning the object of corporeal **_dhammas_**, is absent really. It also perishes away at the arising place and object only. Therefore in this case, the term, shifting **_(saṅkamanā)_** means it is said as a single consciousness of **_vipassanā_** practice due to the same occurrence of consciousness of **_vipassanā_** practice between preceding consciousness of **_vipassanā_** practice, that discerns phenomenon of perishing away of corporeal **_dhammas_**, and succeeding consciousness of **_vipassanā_** practice that discerns phenomenon of perishing away of previous one by using preaching methodology called **_ekatta naya_** (= same conditions are applied as single unit). If another way of interpretation is accepted, unfavourable meaning as "the **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge which has object of phenomenon of perishing away of corporeal **_dhammas_** is a specific kind, the **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge which has object of phenomenon of perishing away of preceding consciousness of **_vipassanā_** practice is another one, resulting in varying of each consciousness of **_vipassanā_** practice; therefore, there is no shifting any more!" etc., will be occurred consequently. It should be recognized on the following term, **_paññāaya vivaṭṭanā_**, similarly. **_(Mahāṭī-2442,443)_**

In this stage of knowledge of Dissolution, various **_vatthu_** (object) must be shifted one after another and discerned. It should be recognized, the consciousness means mental **_dhammas_** of great wholesome impulsions of mind-door cognitive process of **_vipassanā_** practice. It arises in sequence as one mind-door advertence and seven times of impulsions, generally.

2. **_paññāaya vivaṭṭanā_** \_\_\_\_ It is the nature of back out of arising **_(udaya)_** through only phenomenon of perishing away of those **_nata-ñāṇa dhammas_**, is taken into heart by **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge, which is occurring by means of discerning on phenomena of arising and passing away of both conditioned things called **_ñāta_** and preceding **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge called **_ñāṇa._** Therefore the practicing **_meditatior_** has to endeavour in order to put well the consciousness of **_vipassanā_** practice on the phenomenon of perishing away **_(vaya)_** after neglecting on phenomena of arising of both **_ñāta_** and **_ñāṇa. (Vs-2-280, Mahāṭī-2-443)_**
   \*\*

3. **\_āvajjanabala (ability to advert) \_\_\_\_\_** After discerning on phenomenon of perishing away of corporeal **_dhamma_**, the occurrence of capable of discerning on the phenomenon of perishing away corporeal **_dhamma_**, is called **_āvajjanabala_** (ability to advert). With regarding to this word, the efficiency and mastery of the knowledge of Dissolution is shown.
   \*\*\*

### **_PAGE-303_**

These three properties, shifting of **_vatthu (vatthu saṅkamanā)_**, breaking out of arising **_(udaya)_** through only pure phenomenon of perishing away is kept in mind **_(vivaṭṭānā)_**, and ability to advert contiguously, are called **_ārammaṇa paṭisaṅkhā bhangānupassanā ñāṇa_**. It means that after the phenomenon of perishing away of corporeal **_dhamma_** is known by the knowledge and than the contemplation is accomplished by discerning on the phenomenon of perishing away of that knowledge again. **_(Vs-2-280, Mahāṭī-2-443)_**

It should be understood on the fact that after discerning of on phenomena of perishing away of various objects, from feeling aggregates to aging-death, of conditioned things and then the phenomenon of perishing away of that **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge is discerned again, similarly, is also designated as **_ārammaṇa paṭisaṅkhā bhangānupassanā ñāṇa._**

**2. _ārammaṇa anvayena, ubho ekavavatthanā._**

#### **_nirodhe adhimuttat, vayalakkhaṇa vipassanā ñāṇa_ _(Paṭisam-55)_**

**_ārammaṇa anvayena =_** Through following the object which is worth knowing and seeing recently **_(diṭṭha)_**,

**_ubho_** = two kinds of objects, **_diṭṭha_** and **_a-diṭṭha_** (= the object which is not worth knowing and seeing recently), are being **_ekavatatthāna_** = distinguished and kept in mind as the same nature called momentary perishing away **_(khaṇabhanga)_** and **_adhimutatā_** = the occurrence of inclination **_niroda_** = into the ceaseless phenomenon of momentary cessation, **_esā_** = these are called **_vaya lakkhaṇa vipassanā = vipassanā_** practice that discerns phenomenon of decaying **_(vaya lakkhaṇa)_** of conditioned things. **_ārammaṇa anvayena, ubho ekavavatthanā_** \_\_\_\_ As this worth knowing and seeing recently by following objects of conditioned things called **_ñāta-ñāṇa_** which have been known and seen penetratively by experiential knowledge, perishes away, similarly those objects which has been discerned by **_Vipassana_** Knowledge, i.e., those past conditioned things had also been perished away, it will also perish away in future, and objects which has not been discerned by **_Vipassana_** Knowledge, should be kept in mind well s the same phenomenon called ceaseless momentary decaying, for the practicing **_meditatior_** (In this case, opinion of **_dhamma_** concerning to **_diṭṭha_** **_a-diṭṭha_**, should be recognized as mentioned above.) It is right. \_\_\_\_ Commentator Sayadaws of olden days said these words . \_\_\_\_ **_\* samvijjamānamhi visuddha dassano, tadanvayan neti atitanagāte. sabbepi saṅkhārajata palokino, ussāvaindū suriyeva uggate._**

**_samvijjamānamhi_** = Present conditioned things which are worth knowing and seeing by experiential knowledge, to which are known and seen by ... **_visuddha dāssano_** = this practising **_meditatior_** with very clear knowledge that is ablity to discern phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things, and then he **_neti_** = performs to achieve **_tadanvayam_** = **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge that follows to the knowledge discerning on

phenomenon of perishing away of those present conditioned things, **_atīte_** = for the purpose of discerning on past conditioned things and **_anāgate_** = future ones, **_paloki iva_** = as destruction of **_ussāvanindu_** = dew drops occurs **_sūriye uggate_** = when the sun arise, indeed **_(Vs-2-280)_**
\*\*

#### **PAGE – 304**

= Present conditioned things which are worth knowing and seeing by experiential knowledge, to which are known and seen by the practising **_meditatior_** with very clear knowledge, that is ability to discern phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things and then he performs to achieve **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge that follows to the knowledge discerning on phenomenon of perishing of those present conditioned things fro the purpose of discening on past conditioned things and future ones. As destruction of dew drops occurs when the sun arises, indeed. **_(Vs-2-280)_**

**_nirodha adhimuttatā_ (= inclination towards momentary cessation)** \_\_\_\_ In this way after distinguishing and keeping in mind as "those two kinds of conditioned things, viz., **_diṭṭha_** and **_adiṭṭha_** which have the same phenomenon through momentary cessation which is ceaseless decaying event, is performed, the occurrence of taking into heart that phenomenon of momentary cessation only, the occurrence of respecting to that phenomenon of momentary cessation, the occurrence of inclining to wards that phenomenon of momentary cessation, the occurrence of bending towards that phenomenon of momentary cessation, the occurrence of slanting towards that phenomenon of momentary cessation is called **_nirodhe adhimuttatā_** (= taking into heart momentary cessation). Thus, distinguishing and keeping in mind on the same phenomenon of momentary cessation of two kinds of object, **_diṭṭha-adiṭṭha_**, through following object of conditioned things which are worth knowing and seeing by experiential knowledge is called **_vayalakkhaṇā nupassanā = bhnangānupassanā_**, which discerns the phenomenon of decaying **_(vaya lakkhaṇā). (Vs-2-280)_**

**_\* ārammañāṇañcapaṭissaṅkha, bhangañca anupassati. suññato ca upaṭṭhānam, adhipañña vipassanā. (Paṭisam - 56) paṭsaṅkha =_** After knowing on **_ārammaṇañca_** = object of conditioned things form corporeal aggregates to aging-death, = **_bhaṅgañca_** phenomenon of perishing away of consciousness which has the object of that corporeal **_dhammas_**, **_anupassati =_** is also discerned over and over again. **_upaṭṭhānam_** = The appearance **_suññnato ca_** = of nature of nothingness is also **_ijjhati_** = accomplished well.

**_ayam_** = This is called **_adhipaññā vipassanā_** = advancement of knowledge of **_vipassanā._**

**_ārammañāṇca paṭsaṅkhā bhaṅghañca anupassati_** = After knowing previous object of conditioned things, corporeal **_dhammas_** etc., and then the phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things, that corporeal **_dhammas_** etc., is discerned, afterwards the phenomenon of perishing away of preceding consciousness of **_vipassanā_** practice is discerns for the practisig **_meditatior_** who discerned phenomenon of perishing away of two kinds of **_dhammas_** called **_ñāta-ñāṇa_** in this way.

The appearance of nothingness of conditioned things, which is void of self **_(atta)_**, as ... "only conditioned things are destructing, the phenomenon of perishing away of those conditioned things, is called death **_(maraṇa)_**, there is no body that can be designated as 'self' other than conditioned things, is accomplished. **_(Vs-2-280)_**

**_adhipaññā vipassanā_**\_\_\_\_ These three kinds of insight, viz, (1) **_ārammañāṇca paṭsaṅkhā_** which discerns the object of phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things, corporeal **_dhammas_** etc., after knowing on object of conditioned thins, corporeal **_dhammas_** etc.,

2. **_bhangānupassanā ñāṇa_** which discerns the phenomenon of perishing away of preceding consciousness of **_vipassanā_** practice again,
3. **_suññatānupassanā ñāṇa_** which is a kind of appearance as nothingness, void of self of conditioned things, \_\_\_\_
   \*\*

#### **PAGE - 305**

` `are called **_adhipañña vipassanā_** (= advancement of knowledge of **_vipassanā._**) **_(Vs-2280)_**

Due to the knowledge of Dissolution, which is capable of discerning on phenomenon of perishing away of two kinds of conditioned things called **_ñāta-ñāṇa_**, is able to know and see penetratively on the nature of non-indulgence of any kind of person, being, self of conditioned things it is essential to know and see penetratively on the character of non-self **_(anatta lakkhaṇa)._** Therefore it is preached the fact that in the insight of **_meditatior_** who is discerning on the phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things, the appearance as the nature of nothingness can be accomplished. **_(Mahāṭī-2-443)_**

If conditioned things can be occurred as the indulgence of any kind of person, being, self **_(atta)_**, the wish as “conditioned things must not be destructed in this way”, would be fulfilled. However it never get as the wish made on conditioned things really. Therefore it means that the nature of nothingness which is void of self of conditioned things appears in the insight of **_meditatior_**. Therefore commentator Sayadaws of olden days said these words. \_\_\_\_ **_\* khandha nirujjhanti na catthi añño, khandāna bhedo maraṇantivuccati._**

##### ` `**_Tesam khayam passati appamatto, maṇinva vijjham vajirena yoniso. (Vs-2-281)_**

**_Khandhā_** = Conditioned things which are aggregates **_(khandhā)_** only **_nirujjhanti_** = cease. **_imasamim loke_** = In this world **_na ca atthi_** = there is neither **_añño= dhamma_** which is capable of ceasing, nor person who is expireable, other than aggregates indeed.

**_bhedo_** = The phenomenon of breaking down **_khandhānam_** = of aggregates **_vuccati_** = is worth designating as **_maraṇanti_** = death **_(maraṇa) appamatto_** = The practicing **_meditatior_** with non-forgetfulness **_passati_** = discerns **_khayam_** = phenomenon of destruction, which appears for every moment, **_tesam khandhānam_** = of those aggregates.

**_Yathā kin_** = How it is that \_\_\_\_

**_Kysalo puriso vijjhanto_** = when a skilful sculptor sculptures **_maṇim_** = into the ruby ball

**_vajirena yoniso_** = by means of diamond with right procedure, **_manasikaroti iva_** = as (he) takes into heart **_chiddameva maṇissa_** = only aperture of ruby **_na manasikaroti =_**but not taking into heart **_vaṇṇādim_** = colour etc., **_maṇissa_** = of ruby, **_evameva_** = similarly, **_nirantaram bhangameva_** = only ceaseless phenomena of perishing away **_saṅkhārānam_** = of conditioned things **_manasikaroti_** = is taken into heart (as **_anicca, dukkha, anatta_**) **_yoniso_** = with the help of wise attention.

**_manasikaroti_** = It is taken into heart

**_suññato_** = as the nature of nothingness which is void of self,

**_na manasikaroti_** = but not taking into heart, **_saṅkhāre_** = pure conditioned things only. **_(Vs-2-281)_**

Conditioned things which are aggregates only cease. In this world, there is neither **_dhamma_** which is capable of ceasing, nor person who is expireable, other than aggregates indeed. The phenomenon of breaking down of aggregates is worth designating as death. The practicing **_meditatior_** with non-forgetfulness discerns phenomenon of destruction, which appears for every moment, of those aggregates. How it is that \_\_\_\_ when a skillful sculptor sculptures into the ruby ball bay means of diamond with right procedure, as (he) takes into heart

#### **PAGE- 306**

only aperture of ruby but not colour etc., of ruby, similarly, only ceaseless phenomena of perishing away of conditioned things is taken into heart (as **_anicca, dukkha, anatta_**) with the help of wise attention. It is taken into heart as the nature of nothingness, which is void of self but not pure conditioned things only. In other words, \_\_\_\_ as the place which has been bored through by diamond of sculptor who bores ruby ball, never reach to refilled condition again, similarly after discerning on the phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things by the knowledge of Dissolution which is like very hard diamond, the obsession, as permanence **_(nicca)_** can not be fallen on to those conditioned things again. Thus only the phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things is discerned. **_(Vs-2-281)_**

##### **4. _kusalo tīisu anupassanāsu, catasso ca vipassanāsu. tayo upaṭṭhāne kusalatā, nānādiṭṭhīsu na kampati. (Paṭisam-56)_** **_bhikkhu_** = The practising **_bhikkhu_**

**_kusale_** = who is skilful **_tīsu anupassanāsu_** = in three kinds of contemplation, **_aniccānuapassanā_** etc., **_na kampati_** = is not shaken by **_nā nā diṭṭhīsu_** = various wrong views **_kusalatā_** = due to occurrence of mastery in **_catasso ca vipassanāsu_** = both four kinds of contemplation, **_nibidānupassanā_** etc., and **_tayo upaṭṭhāne ca_** = three kinds of appearance.

The practising **_bhikkhu_** who is skilful in three kinds of contemplation called **_aniccānupassanā, dukkhānupassanā, anattānupassanā,_** is not shaken by various wrong views, due to occurrence of mastery in both four kinds of contemplation called **_nibbidānupassanā, viragānupassanā, nirodhānupassanā, paṭinissaggānupassanā_** and three kinds of appearance called **_aniccato upaṭṭahāna_** (appearance as impermanence), **_dukkhato upaṭṭahāna_** (appearance as suffering), **_anattatoupaṭṭahāna_** (appearance as non-self). **_(Paṭisam-56)_**

**_Tayo upaṭṭahāna_** (three kinds of appearance) \_\_\_\_ During discerning as **_anicca,_** by taking the object of phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things, the appearance as the nature of destruction, decaying **_(khayavaya)_** which is ceaseless phenomenon, is called **_aniccatao upaṭṭhāna_**. During discerning as **_dukkha_** by taking the object of phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things, the appearance as fearfulness is called **_dukkha_** to **_upaṭṭhāna_**. During discerning as **_anatta,_** by taking the object of phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things the appearance as the nature of nothingness, which is void of self

##### **_(atta)_** of conditioned things, is called **_anattato upaṭṭhāna. (Mahāṭī-2-444)_**

` `The meaning of four kinds of contemplation, **_nibbidānupassanā_** etc., will be explicit later.

In this way, after taking into heart a way that ... "only conditioned thing, which has not ceased yet, ceases immediately, only conditioned things, which has not broken down, breaks down immediately..." that practising **_meditatior_** discerns only the phenomenon of perishing away of those conditioned things but

#### **PAGE -307**

neglecting on the phenomena of **_uppāda-ṭhiti-pavatta-nimitta_**, as seeing on breaking down of raw earthen pot which is weak and wet, as seeing on disappearing of fog which is very fine and scattered, as seeing on destruction of sesame which is roasted in an oven. For worldly simile is that \_\_\_\_ as a man with good sight who is standing on the bank of either lake or river, sees the phenomena of arising and perishing away of numerous water bubbles on the surface of water during heavy rains, similarly \_\_\_\_ that practising **_meditatior_** sees very rapid processes of perishing away of all kinds of conditioned things by **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge. It is right. \_\_\_\_ The Buddha preached the following verse with referring the practising person who discerns on perishable nature as water bubble, \_\_\_\_

**_\* yathā bubbuļakam passe, yathā passe marīcikam._**

##### ` `**_evam lokam avekkhantam, maccurājā na passati. (Vs-2-281)_**

**_passe = passeyya yathā_** = As discerning **_bubuļakam_** = on water bubbles, **_passe = passeyya yathā_** = as discerning **_mirīcikam_** = on mirage, **_evam tathā_** = similarly \_\_\_ **_avekkhantam_** = the **_meditatior_** with **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge who discerns phenomenon of perishing away **_lokam_** = of world of conditioned things, **_na passati_** = is not seen by **_maccurajā_** = the king of death.

As discerning on water bubbles or mirage, similarly \_\_\_\_ the **_meditatior_** with **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge, who discerns phenomenon of perishing away of world of conditioned things called corporealities and mentalities, is not seen by the king of death. It means that due to attainment of the Path of Arahant through endeavouring of discerning on dissolution of conditioned things up to the Fourth Path-Knowledge, **_nibbāna_**, which is impossible to be seen by king of death after final death of Arahant, is reached well resulting from lack of occurrence of new existence again. **_(Vs-2-281, Mahāṭī-2-444)_**

For above explanation of the commentary, sub-commentator Sayadaw who was an exegete performed exegeses of three similes as follows \_\_\_\_

1. **_dubbalabhājanūpamā_** = The simile of weak and wet raw earthen pot has advantage to show occurrence of acquired ability to break down of conditioned things as specific nature.
1. **_vippakiriya mānasukhumarajūpama_** = The simile of very fine and scattered fog has advantage to show occurrence of disconnected, scattering in disorder of conditioned things.
1. **_bijjiyamānatilūpamā_**= The simile of sesame which is roasted in an oven has advantage to show occurrence of destruction of conditioned things in every instant. It should be recognized in this way. **_(Mahāṭī-2-444)_**

##### **3.17 Knowledge of Dissolution which is surrounded by eight kinds of advantages**

In this way, for the practising **_meditatior_** who always discerns as ..."all kinds of conditioned things are rapidly perishing away"... by insight, the knowledge of Dissolution, which is surrounded by eight kinds of advantages, become strong and sharp efficiency. Eight kinds of advantage of Dissolution are \_\_\_\_

1. ability to remove **_bhavadiṭṭhi = sassataditthi_** (= wrong view of eternalism) (It is impossible to occur **_sassata diṭṭhi_** , as "self is eternal" in the continuum of **_meditatior_** with knowledge of Dissolution.)
1. daring to die,
1. ability to endeavour strenuously and perpetually for the advancement of practice,
1. presence of purified livelihood due to lack of selfish desire,
1. ability to remove various kinds of care to perform heavy or little responsibilities due to presence of strong knowledge of Fear **_(samvega)_**
1. free from danger due to lack of strong attachment of existence of himself,
1. presence of patience and enjoyment to perform wholesome deeds, due to presence of experience of impermanent phenomenon of conditioned things,
1. ability to suppress and remove unhappiness to seclude in quiet forest monastery, dissatisfaction to perform extra-ordinary wholesome deeds called practices of **_samatha vipassanā_**, pleasing with sensual pleasure. **_(Vs-2-281)_**

` `Therefore those exegetes of olden days said as follows. \_\_\_\_ **_\* imāni aṭṭhaggumnuttamāni, disvā tahim sammasate punappunam._**

` `**_āditta celassirasūpamo muni, bhangānupassī amatassa pattiyā. (Vs-2-282)_** **_disvā_** = After seeing on **_imāni aṭṭhagguṇmuttamāni_** = these eight kinds of noble advantages, ability to remove eternalism etc., of that Contemplation of Dissolution, **_muni_** = the practising **_bhikkhu_**, **_ādittacelassirasūpamo_** = compared to the simile of the person whose turban is firing, **_bhangānupassī_** = who always discerns on the phenomenon of perishing away, **_sammasate_** = performs **_vipassanā_** practice by taking the object of phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things, **_punappunam_** = over and over again,

**_pattiyā_** = in order to reach **_amatassa_** = deathless element called **_nibbāna._**

For a men whose turban is firing, the function of extinguishment on fire is very important function. However, the function of extinguishment on fire of wrong view of personality **_(sakkāyadiṭṭhi)_** is more important

#### **PAGE-309**

than that function, really. The practising **_bhikkhu_** who wants to extinguish that fire of wrong view of personality, has to perform **_vipassanā_** practice by alternative reasoning on three general characters after seeing on pure phenomenon of perishing away of two kinds of conditioned things called **_ñāta-ñāṇa_**, in order to attain deathless element called **_nibbāna_**.

**_Vipassanā_** practice can be performed by means of the most preferable methods, twofold corporeality-mentality method, fivefold aggregates methods etc., after seeing on the ultimate nature of conditioned things occurring in three periods called past, future, present and two continuums called internal, external, with the help of knowledge of Dissolution surrounding by these eight kinds of noble advantages. It should be recognized the fact that mental **_dhammas_** of the first, second, third and fourth absorptions are also included in those conditioned things called **_ñāta_**.

**3.18 How the way of practice falls on four kinds of contemplation _(satipaṭṭhāna)_**
\*\*

#### **Pāli Quotation (Vs-1-269)**

In this work called **_nibbāna gamini paṭipadā_**, practices of **_samatha_** and **_vipassanā_**, from beginning of concentration of mindfulness of breathing to the knowledge of Dissolution, have been presented in detailed. The Buddha preached on the way of practice of mindfulness of breathing through four kinds of tetrads instructions systematically, to wit,

1. the first tetrad instructions, by means of **_kāyānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna_** (contemplation on the all constituents of body),
1. the second tetrad instructions, by means of **_vedanānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna_** (contemplation on feeling)
1. the third tetrad instructions, by means of **_cittānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna_** (contemplation on consciousness)
1. the fourth tetrad instructions, by means of **_dhammanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna_** (contemplation on phenomena), respectively.

In the aspect of **_samatha_** practice, repeated discerning on **_assāsa passāsa kāya_** (= physical appearance of in-breath out-breath), called **_parikamma nimmita, uggahanimitta, paṭibhāga nimitta_**, in the aspect of **_vipassanā_** practice, repeated discerning on **_rūpakāya nāmakāya_** (physical and mental constituents), are called the **contemplation on all constituents of body _(kāyānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna)_**.

(a) In the aspect of **_samatha_** practice, both the advancement of concentration by taking the object of physical apperance of in-breath out-breath called **_parikamma nimitta, uggahanimitta, paṭibhāga nimitta_**, and the accomplishment to occur the first, second, third and fourth absorptions successively by taking the object **_paṭibhāga nimitta_** of mindfulness of breathing, afterwards entering into those absorptions over and over again, are called fulfilment of contemplation of all constituents of body.

(b) In the aspect of **_vipassanā_** practice, after keeping in mind the corporealities as priority, of all conditioned things, viz, factors of absorption together with associating mental **_dhammas_** within those four kinds of absorptions, depended heart base **_(hadaya vatthu)_** with (54) kinds of corporeal **_dhammas_**, and remaining conditioned things called miscellaneous ones occurring in three periods and two continuums, repeated discerning on three general characters of those conditioned things, is also called fulfilment of contemplation of all constituents of body. During performing on **_vipassanā_** practice in this way, after corporal **_dhammas_** are discerned as priority and beforehand, mental **_dhammas_** are discerned later, resulting in falling into **_kāyāupassanā satipaṭṭhāna_**. Now the way of practice relating to the second tetrad instructions would be continued to present as follow. \_\_\_\_

##### **3.18.2 Second tetrad instructions _(dutiya catukka)_ Pāli Quotation (M-3-125, Sam-3-279, Vi-1-88)**

[With regarding to these explanations found in above commentary, it will be continued to present,

1. how to distinguish and keep in mind corporeal _dhamma_ which are called the body of inbreath and out-breath (_assāsa passāsa kāya_) and all kinds of corporealities occurring throughout body (_karajakāya_), in the section of **_rūpa_ _kammaṭṭhāna_** (= practice on the corporeality),
1. how to distinguish and keep in mind mental _dhamma_ (= consciousness and mental concomitants), in the section of **_nāma kammaṭṭhāna_** (= practice on the mentality),
1. how to distinguish and keep in mind the mode of occurrence or resultant five aggregates depending upon obvious occurrence of causal _dhamma_, ignorance, craving, clinging, *kamma*formation, _kamma_ etc., within three periods, past, future and present, in the section of **_paṭiccasamuppāda_** (Dependence-Origination),
1. how to distinguish and keep in mind the nature of those _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ called corporeality, mentality, causes, results, by means of characteristics (_lakkhaṇa_),function (_rasa_), manifestation (_paccupaṭṭhāna_) and proximate cause (_padaṭṭhāna_), in the section of **_lakkhaṇādicatukka_** (= tetrad modes, characteristics; etc.),
1. how to develop _vipassanā_ practice on those _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_, in the section of **_vipassanā_** , respectively.

Now, it would be continued to present remaining three kinds of tetrad instructions (_catukka_). There is no specific way of practice among those three tetrad instructions. It is because the fact that it would be preached for the **_meditatior_** who had attained absorptions by means of practice of the first tetrad instructions called **_kāyānupassanā_**, on

1. the second tetrad instructions by means of **_vedanānupassanā_** (repeated discerning on feeling),
1. the third tetrad instructions by means of **_cittānupassanā_** (repeated discerning on consciousness),
1. the fourth instructions by means of **_dhammānupassanā_** (repeated discerning on _dhamma_), respectively.]

It should be practised by ceasing of gross and gross **_citta saṅkhāra_** called feelingaggregate, perception-aggregate, which are associating with four kinds of absorption, in order to fulfil the occurrence of out-breath.

##### **_(1) Pīti paṭisamvedī_**

In that word, **_pīti paṭisamvedī_**, the pleasurable interest **_(pīti)_** has to be known thoroughly by means of both

\1. **_ārammaṇato_** = the nature of object and 2. **_asammohṇato_** = the nature of non-delusion.

1. How the pleasurable interest has to be known by means of the nature of object is that \_\_\_ as shown in tetrad method of absorptions, two kinds of absorptions, the first absorption and the second absorption, which are associating with pleasurable interest **_(Pīti)_**, would be entered one. By the time the absorption is being entered, that **_meditatior_** is worth knowing factor of absorption called pleasurable interest which belongs to the first or second absorption which has object of sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing, due to presence of attainment of absorption and due to taking object of sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing. This is because that object of sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing is worth knowing thoroughly.
1. How the pleasurable interest would be known apparently by means of the **nature of nondelusion**?

As shown in tetrad method of absorptions, two kinds of absorptions, the first absorption and the second absorption, which are associating with pleasurable interest (_pīti_), would be entered one by one and it would be emerged from it and then that pleasurable interest which is yoking with absorption would be discerned as the nature of dissolution and perishing away. By the time the pleasurable interest is discerned by and seen by _vipassanā_ knowledge, the **_meditatior_** penetratively know and see both specific character and general character of pleasurable interest (= associating mental _dhamma_ including _pīti_ as significant object). That penetrative knowing and seeing on specific and general characters of pleasurable interest is called “it would be known by means of the nature of non-delusion (_asammoha_). Thus the pleasurable interest would be known apparently by means of the nature of non-delusion. (_Visuddhi_-1-279)

##### **_(2) Sukha paṭisamvedī_**

The first absorption, second absorption, third absorption, which are associating with the agreeable feeling **_(sukha vedanā)_**, are entered one by one. By the time the absorption is being entered, due to presence of attainment of absorption, due to obvious occurrence of object of **_ānapāna paṭibhāga nimitta_** which is capable of benefiting by the efficiency of relation of object, in order to improve agreeable feeling exceedingly, due to apparent knowing on the object of **_ānapāna paṭibhāga nimitta_**, the agreeable feeling which belongs to the absorption with **_ānapāna paṭibhāga nimitta_**, is known

#### **PAGE – 312**

apparently, depending upon ability to take the object of that **_ānapāna paṭibhāga nimitta_**.

\2. After entering into the first absorption, second absorption, third absorption, which are associating with the agreeable feeling, and emerging from those absorptions, the agreeable feeling, which is associating with absorption, is discerned as the nature of destruction and decaying **_(khaya-vaya)_**. By the time that agreeable feeling is seen by **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge, due to presence of ability of penetrative knowing and seeing of the **_meditatior_** on the specific character and general character of agreeable feeling, the agreeable feeling **_(sukha)_** is worth knowing and seeing obviously by means of the nature of non-delusion **_(asammoha)_**.

***Pāli Quotation(Vs-1-280)( Māhatī-1-341, Mūlaṭī-1-116)(*3paragraph at page 312*)*** With relating to the phrase, _sukha_ _paṭisamvedī_, it should be recognized the fact in _Paṭisambhidā_ _magga_ Pāli Text, that “**_sukhanti dve sukhāni kāyikañca sukham cetasikañca_** = it would be preached on two kinds of agreeable feeling as both bodily agreeable feeling (_kāyika sukha_) and mentally agreeable feeling (_cetasika sukha_), in order to show the fields of _vipassanā_ knowledge (_vipassanā_ _bhūmi_) which are occurred by means of three kinds of generalization on five aggregates, corporeality, mentality, and _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_, occurring in 31 realms, which are occurred by 11 modes of situations, such as , past, future, present, internal, external etc. called miscellaneous _saṅkhāra_ (_pakiṇṇaka_ _saṅkhāra_). This is because the fact that it is impossible to occur bodily agreeable feeling in the absorption. (It means that during the absorption is occurring, mentally agreeable feeling only can be occurred within mind moment of impulsion of absorption but not bodily agreeable feeling. Bodily agreeable feeling can be occurred by associating with touching-consciousness which is joyful, rootless wholesome resultant (_a-hetuka_ _kusala_ _vipāka_ _sukha_-_sahagata_ _kāyaviññāṇa_ _citta_) but not with consciousness of impulsions of absorption.) **(_Visuddhi_-1-280; _Māhatī-1-341, Mūlaṭī-1-116)_**

According to above Pāli Text, commentary, sub-commentary, the **_meditatior_** with vehicle of **_samatha_** practice **_(samathayānika puggula)_**, who has fulfilled up to absorption stage for both mindfulness of breathing and other meditation subjects of **_samatha_** practice, has to discern remaining conditioned things which are called miscellineous conditioned things other than fundamental absorption of **_vipassanā_** practice in the stage of **_vipassanā_** practice. This is essential obligation for himself. With regarding to that word, it is no need to say whether those conditioned things of absorption which are associating with fundamental absorption **_(pādaka jhāna)_** have to be performed as **_vipassanā_** practice.

In this work, absorptions of mindfulness of breathing, especially the fourth absorption, is presented as the fundamental absorption of **_vipassanā_** practice. Every kind of corporeal or mental **_dhammas_**, causal or resultant **_dhammas_** other then that fundamental absorption, is conditioned things which is the object of **_Vipassanā_**

Knowledge, called **_pakiṇṇaka saṅkhāra_** (miscellineous conditioned things). Those are foundation of **_vipassanā_** practice **_(vipassanā bhūmi)_**. For a practising **_meditatior_** who loves the truth should like to be grateful respectfully on these Pāli Text, commentray and subcommentary which show the right course leading to **_nibbāna_** really.

These feeling aggregate and perception, aggregate \_\_\_ agreeable feeling and perception which are associating with the first, second and third absorptions, neutrality feeling and perception, which are associating with the fourth absorption, are called **_cittasaṅkhāra_**. The practising **_meditatior_** has to practise in order to fulfil the occurrence of inbreath and out-breath by knowing apparently on those **_cittasaṅkhāra dhamma_**. The Buddha instructed to breathe through knowing on **_cittasaṅkhāra dhamma._** It should be recognized on two stages, the stage of **_samatha_** and the stage of **_vipassanā_** practice as follows. \_\_\_\_

1. The first absorption, second absorption, third absorption of mindfulness of breathing, which are associating with agreeable feeling, then the fourth absorption, which is associating with neutrality feeling, are entered one by one. By the time the absorption is being entered, due to presence of attainment of absorption, due to obvious occurrence of **_ānapāna paṭibhāga nimitta_**, which is capable of benefiting by the efficiency of relation of object, in order to improve **_citta saṅkhāra dhamma_** called feeling, perception exceedingly, due to apparent knowing on the object of **_ānapāna paṭibhāga nimittta_**, those **_dhammas_** of **_citta saṅkhāra_** which belong to the absorption with **_ānapāna paṭibhāga nimitta,_** is known apparently, depending upon ability to take the object of that **_ānapānapaṭibhāga nimitta_**. This is how **_cittasaṅkhāra dhammas_** is known apparently in the stage fo **_samatha_** practice.
1. After entering into four kinds of absorption which are associating with feeling, perception and emerging from those absorptions, feeling and perception, which are associating with respective absorptions, are discerned as the nature of destruction and decaying **_(khayavaya)_**. By the time those feeling and perception are seen by **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge, due to presence of ability of penetrative know in and seeing of the **_meditatior_** on the specific character and general character of feeling, perception, two kinds of **_dhammas_**, feeling and perception, called **_citt saṅkhāra_**, are worth knowing and seeing obviously by means of the nature of nondelusion **_(asammoha)_**. This is how **_citta saṅkhāra dhamma_** is known apparently in the stage of **_vipassanā_** practice.

In the section of concentration of mindfulness of breathing, Section(3), Volume.1., way of successive cessation of in-breath and out-breath called **_kāyasaṅkhāra_** in **_samatha_** stage, has been presented in detail. Similarly \_\_\_\_ it should be understood on the way of successive cessation of **_citta saṅkhāra dhamma_** in that way.

#### **_Vedanānupassanā_ (contemplation on feeling)**

In the word, **_Pīti paṭisamvedī_**, the feeling is preached through pleasurable interest **_(Pīti)_** as priority. In the word, **_sukha paṭisamvedī_**, however, the feeling is preached directly as apparent nature. In two words, **_citta saṅkhāra paṭisamvedī_** and **_passambhayam cittasaṅkhāram_**, the feeling, which is associating with perception, is preached commonly, due to presence of preaching that "these tow kinds of mental concomitants, both perception and feeling, which are concerning to consciousness **_(citta paṭibaddha)_**, are called **_citta saṅkhāra dhamma_**" in **_Patṭisam bhidā Magga-187, M-1-376_**.

Thus it should be recognized the fact that the second instructions are preached by means of **_vedanānupassanā. (Vs-1-280)._**

In accordance with these commentaries and sub-commentaries, it should not be discerned on a single feeling only. It should be recognized the fact that all associating mental **_dhammas_** with that feeling of absorption must be discerned commonly or one by one. In the commentary called **_Visuddhi Magga, 2-222_**, it is instructed that after mental **_dhammas_** of absorption are discerned, depended four great elements and derived corporealities must also be discerned continuously.

##### **(1) _Citta Paṭisamvedī_**

In the word, **_citta paṭisamvedī_**, the consciousness of absorption has to be known thoroughly by means of both...

\1. **_ārammaṇato_** = the nature of object and 2. **_āsammaṇato_** = the nature of non-delusion.

1. With the purpose of knowing apparently on each consciousness of absorption, the first absorption, second absorption, third absorption and fourth absorption are entered one by one. By the time the absorption is being entered, that **_meditatior_** knows apparently the consciousness of absorption which has the object of that **_paṭibhaga nimitta_**, due to process of attainment of absorption and due to obvious occurrence of **_ānāpāna paṭibhaga nimitta_**, which is capable of benefiting by efficiency of relation of object in order to improve the occurrence of consciousness of absorption exceedingly, dur to presence of ability to know apparently the object of **_ānāpāna paṭibhaga nimitta_**, depending upon ability to take the object of that **_ānāpāna paṭibhaga nimitta_**. This is how consciousness of absorption is known apparently by the nature of object.
1. Furthermore, after entering into the first absorption, second absorption, and third absorption and fourth absorption, respectively, and emerging from those absorptions, those consciousness of absorptions which are associating with respective absorptions, are discerned as the nature of destruction and decaying **_(khaya-vaya)_**.
   \*\*

#### **PAGE – 316**

By the time those consciousness of absorptions are seen by **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge, due to presence of ability of penetrative knowing and seeing of the **_meditatior_** on the specific character and general character of consciousness of absorptions then those consciousness of absorptions are worth knowing and seeing obviously by means of the nature of non-delusion **_(asammoha)_**. This is how consciousness of absorption is known apparently in the stage of **_vipassanā_** practice.

##### **(2) _Abhippamodayam cittam_**

During practising by enhancing and pleasing on the consciousness of absorption in order to fulfil the occurrence of in-breath and out-breath, enhancement and pleasure of consciousness of absorption occur by means of both concentration and **_vipassanā_** practice. 1. How enhancement and pleasure of consciousness of absorption through concentration can be improved? \_\_\_\_ Two kinds of absorptions, the first and second absorption, which are associating with pleasurable interest, are entered one by one. By the time the absorption is being entered, that practising **_meditatior_** enhances and pleases the associating consciousness of absorption exceedingly with the help of pleasurable interest which is associating with absorption. This is how enhancement and pleasure of consciousness of absorption through concentration, is improved.

The pleasurable interest, which is associating with consciousness of absorption, is a **_dhammas_** called **_pītisambojjhanga_** (factor of enlightenment of pleasurable interest). It has the specific character of enhancing and pleasing on both physically and mentally. That pleasurable interest of absorption give rise to enhancement and pleasure of associating consciousness of absorption by efficiency of relation of both compatibility **_(sahajāata)_** and absorption **_(jhāna)_** resulting from reaching the situation with through bliss and great satisfaction of both physically and mentally. Therefore the Buddha instructed to breathe by entering those two kinds of absorption. **_(Mahāṭī-1-341)_**

2.  How enhancement and pleasure of consciousness of absorption through **_vipassanā_** practice can be improved? \_\_\_\_ After entering into two kinds of absorptions called the first absorption and second absorption, which are associating with pleasurable interest, and emerging from those absorptions, the pleasurable interest, which is associating with absorption, is discerned as the nature of destruction and decaying **_(khaya-vaya)_**. In this way, by the time **_vipassanā_** practice is being performed, that pleasurable interest that is the object of **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge enhances and pleases the consciousness of **_vipassanā_** practice which occurs by taking the object of pleasurable interest. The **_meditatior_** who practises in this way, can be said the person who fulfils the occurrence of in-breath and out-breath by enhancing and pleasing the consciousness well. **_(Vs-1-280,281)_**

Do you want to breath with enhancement and pleasure of the mind all the time? It is so, enter into those absorptions which are associating with pleasurable interest. Pleasurable interest together with mental **_dhammas_** of

#### **PAGE – 317**

absorption must be discerned by **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge over and over again. The **_meditatior_** can breath pleasingly and blissfully throughout entering into absorption in that way, throughout discerning by **_vipassanā_** practice really. These are how the happiness can be found in the present life of a gentleman. it is very grateful to the Buddha really.

As a person pleases and satisfies when he sees very beloved friend who always smiles, similarly, the consciousness of **_vipassanā_** practice that is discerning on mental **_dhammas_** of absorption associating with pleasurable interest, is also full of pleasure and satisfaction. Lofty corporealities produced by mind of both absorption with pleasurable interest and **_vipassanā_** practice spread throughout body. Therefore, it can be said \_\_\_\_ the pleasurable interest has the specific character of enhancing and pleasing on both physically and mentally.

##### **(3) _Samādaham cittam_**

\1. The meaning of “_samādaham cittam_ = it should be practised by putting the mind well on the object in order to fulfil the occurrence of in-breath and out-breath”, is that — it should be practised by putting and leading the mind on to the object of sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing with the help of entering into four kinds of absorption, the first absorption etc., in order to fulfil the occurrence of in-breath and out-breath. (_Visuddhi_-1-281)

It means that — it must be practised by putting the mind into the absorption for the purpose of stability of the mind on the object of sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing after the concentration has been reached up to the apex without shaking the mind but balanced five controlling faculties, with the result that the mind of meditation never approach to any kind of extremity, i.e., retardation of the mind to take the object called **_līnapakkha_** and wandering of the mind from the object called **_udacca pakkha_**, not inclination toward the object of meditation and enhancing of the mind which can cause restlessness of the mind in order to fulfil the occurrence of in-breath and out-breath. (_Mahātīkā_-1-342)

If the breathing is performed by occurring and entering into the absorption, it can be said that the mind is putting well and breathing in the _samatha_ stage. In the _vipassanā_ stage, it must be as follows: — \*

\2. For the **_meditatior_** who enters into four kinds of absorptions one by one and emerges from it and discerns the consciousness of the absorption as the nature of destruction and decaying, a kind of concentration, **momentary one-pointedness** of the mind called _khanika cittekaggatā_ occurs by means of penetrative knowing and seeing on the general characters called _anicca_ (impermanence), _dukkha_ (suffering), _anatta_ (non-self) of those consciousnesses of absorption of every mind moment while the _vipassanā_ knowledge are occurring. It can be said the **_bhikkhu_** who puts his mind on the object called the nature of impermanence, of suffering , of non-self of the consciousness of absorption, as “it would be practised by putting the mind well in order to fulfil the occurrence of in-breath and out-breath”. (_Visuddhi_-1-281) **_khanika cittekaggatā_** — means the concentration which is capable of putting the mind on object momentarily. If that _khanikā_ _samādhi_ (momentary concentration) called _khanikā_ _cittekaggatā_ occurs continuously by means of taking the objects of

(_Visuddhi_-1-281)

It means that — it must be practised by putting the mind into the absorption for the purpose of stability of the mind on the object of sign of full concentration of mindfulness of breathing after the concentration has been reached up to the apex without shaking the mind but balanced five controlling faculties, with the result that the mind of meditation never approach to any kind of extremity, i.e., retardation of the mind to take the object called **_līnapakkha_** and wandering of the mind from the object called **_udacca pakkha_**, not inclination toward the object of meditation and enhancing of the mind which can cause restlessness of the mind in order to fulfil the occurrence of in-breath and out-breath. (_Mahātīkā_-1-342)

1. **mode of suffering**, the nature of being oppressed by continuous process of arising and passing away,

1. **mode of non-self**, the nature of lack of self (_atta_) which is the nondestructive essence, of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_, the consciousness of _vipassanā_ is firmly fixed to those _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ due to lack of suppressing of opposite _dhamma_, such as delusion (_moha_) etc. The commentator, therefore, explained above words accordingly. (_Mahātīkā_-1-342)

It is essential to be noticed the fact this kind of _khanikā_ _samādhi_ can be occurred only in the continuum of **_meditatior_** who attains absorption and is able to carry out _vipassanā_ practice on _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ of absorption. (Those remaining kinds of _khanikā_ _samādhi_ are presented in previous section.) This is the Buddha’s instruction how to put the mind well on the object and breathe in and out systematically.

\1. It would be practiced by means of delivering from opposite _dhamma_ for a long time (**_vikkhambhana vimutti_**), i.e.,

1. from hindering _dhamma_ (**_nīvarana_**) by the first absorption,
1. from initial and sustained application (**_vitakka_**, **_vicāra_**) by the second absorption,
1. from pleasurable interest (**_pīti_**) by the third absorption,
1. from agreeable and disagreeable feelings (**_sukha_**, **_dukkha_**) by the fourth absorption, in order to fulfil the occurrence of in-breath and out-breath. (_Visuddhi_-1-281)

This is the way of breathing with the help of delivering from opposite _dhamma_ by concentration.

\2. The way of practice by means of _vipassanā_ is as follows: —

It would be entered into those four absorptions one by one and emerged from it.

It means that only phenomena of cessation of recent unexperienced conditioned thing are taken into heart but the arising and proliferation of those conditioned things are neglected. **_(Mahāṭī-1-342)_**

That **_meditatior_** who practises in this way, abandons all conditioned things but not obsesses on those ones. It means that \_\_\_\_ these various kinds of contemplation **_(anupassanā ñāṇa)_**, **_aniccānupassanā_** etc., are called **_pariccaga paṭinissagga_**, due to abandonment of both aggregates and **_abhisaṅkhāra dhamma_** which are capable of providing the occurrence of new existences. After seeing on disadvantages called change and alteration of conditioned things, it enters into the Unconditioned Element called **_nibbāna_** through bending and inclining towards it, resulting in designating as **_pakkhandana paṭinessagga_**. Therefore the practising **_meditatior_** with that **_paṭinissaga nupassanā_**, not only abandons defilements as mentioned above but also enters into **_nibbāna_**. The commentator Sayadaw, therefore continued to explain the following exegeses. **_(Mahāṭī-1-342)_**

At the moment of occurrence of _vipassanā_ knowledge, that **_meditatior_** who is discerning by taking the object of perishing away or dissolution (_bhaṅga_) of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ which are led by the consciousness of absorption, causes the in-breath and outbreath by delivering the mind …

1. from perception of permanence (**_nicca saññā_**) by _aniccā_ _nupassanā_
1. from perception of happiness (**_sukha_ _saññā_**) by _dukkhā_ _nupassanā_
1. from perception of self (**_atta saññā_**) by _anattā_ _nupassanā_
1. from strong desire to _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_, **_nandī_** called _sappītika tahnā_ by _nibbidā_ _nupassanā_
1. from lust (**_rāga_**) by _virāgā nupassanā_ which discerns the nature of dissolution of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_
1. from lust (**_samudaya_** = _rāga_) by _nirodhā_ _nupassanā_ which discerns the nature of cessation of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_,
1. from obsession on **permanence** of _saṅkhāra_ by _patinissaggā_ _nupassanā_ which discerns the perishing away of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ and leading to the _nibbāna_ by means of mode of momentary rejecting on _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_, respectively.

The Buddha, therefore, preached that “it would be practiced by delivering the mind from opposite _dhamma_ in order to fulfil the occurrence of in-breath and out-breath”. Thus, it should be recognized on the fact that “this third tetrad instructions would be preached by means of **_cittā_ _nupassanā_** (repeated discerning on consciousness)”. (_Visuddhi_-1-281)

##### **_Pāli Quotation (Di-A1-314, M-A-1-281,282, Abhi-A-2-252) (Mahāṭī-1-342)_**

In accordance with the preaching of the Buddha, "unless all kinds of factors of fivefold clinging to existence **_(upādānakkhandhā)_** called conditioned things, are distiguished through three kinds of full understanding **_(pariñña)_**, the suffering of rounds of rebirth can not be extinguished", in **_Aparijanana Sutta (Sam-2-249,250)_**, above commentaries and subcommentary also explained that all kinds of conditioned things have to be discerned by **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge after discerning on the consciousness as priority. Therefore every **_meditatior_** should like to discern all kinds of conditioned things through discerning on consciousness of absorption as priority.

##### **(1) _Aniccanupassī_**

` `In the case, the commentator instructed to distinguish among these four terms,

1. **_anicca_** (impermanence)
1. **_aniccatā_** (mode of impermanence)
1. **_aniccā nupassanā_** (contemplation as **_anicca_**)
1. **_aniccanupassī_** (the person who has fulfilled with the knowledge of **_aniccā nupassanā_**) 1. Aggregates of fivefold clinging to existence **_(pañcupādānakkhandhā)_**, which are occurring in 11 modes of situations called past, future, present, internal, external, gross, subtle, inferior, superior, far and near, are designated as **_anicca_** (impermanence). Why is it called **_anicca?_** Owing to presence of obvious occurrence of these three kinds of phenomena, viz,

1) the phenomenon of arising **_(uppāda)_**
1) the phenomenon of perishing away **_(vaya)_**
1) the phenomenon of static instant which is special mode that bending towards perishing instant just after arising, those are called **_anicc_** (impermanence).**_(Vs-1-281)_**

[It means that due to presence of three obvious characters of conditioned things, viz, the arising phase ***(uppāda)***, the perishing away ***(vaya)*** and the static phase ***(aññathatta)***, it is designated as ***anicca***.]

###### **_2._ aniccatā\***

_Aniccatā_ means the special mode of occurrence of arising and passing away, static phase which is bending toward the perishing phase, of those five aggregates only. In other words, it means that the momentary perishing away (_khana_ _bhaṅga_) of those ultimate sense of five aggregates without situating as it’s arising phase is called _aniccatā_.

###### **_3._ aniccā nupassanā**

It means that repeated discerning on those five aggregates, such as corporeality, etc., as _anicca_ (impermanence) by means of _aniccatā_ through which the momentary perishing away of ultimate  
\*\*

#### **PAGE-323**

\*

_dhamma_ is seen by _vipassanā_ insight, is called _aniccānupassanā_. In other words, the _vipassanā_ knowledge which repeatedly discerns as _anicca_ is designated as _aniccānupassanā_.

##### **_4._ aniccānupassī\***

The **_meditatior_** who had fulfilled with that _aniccānupassanā_ knowledge is called _aniccā_ _nupassī_. Therefore, it should be recognized the fact that the person who fulfils the occurrence of in-breath and out-breath by repeated discerning on those five aggregates as _anicca_ can be said the person who is practicing by repeated discerning as _anicca_ in this fourth tetrad instructions. (_Visuddhi_-1-281,282)

**_uppāda_-_vaya_-_aññathattā_ _uppāda_**: — Those corporeal and mental _dhamma_ called _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ which are occurred by unity of various adaptations of respective causes, are called _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_. The sudden occurrence of newly one without it is present previously, the attaining of the nature of ultimate _dhamma_ due to presence of

1. direct cause called _hetu_ or _janaka_ which is capable of arising those corporeality and mentality directly, and
1. supporting cause called _upatthambhaka_ or _paccaya_ which is capable of supporting to occur those corporeality and mentality, is called the **arising** (**_uppāda_**).

**_vaya_**: — The cessation of those occurred _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ as the momentary

dissolution (_khana_ _bhaṅga_), is called **perishing away** (**_vaya_**).

**_aññathatta_**: — The occurrence of ultimate _dhamma_ with special mode called static

phase (_thiti_), which is bending toward perishing phase just after arising, is called **_aññathatta_**. **_saṅkhata_**: — The Buddha preached in _Saṅkhata_ _lakkhanā sutta, Aṅguttara Tikanipāta_ (_Aṅg_-1-150) that there are three characteristics of _saṅkhata_, viz, the arising, static, perishing away, in all kinds of ultimate _dhamma_. The arising _dhamma_, then, perishes away. It is not the fact that the arising _dhamma_ is the specific one while the perishing and static _dhamma_ is another kind actually. It will be clear understood as follows: —

As it is no difference between the arising phase of one kind of ultimate _dhamma_ and the perishing phase of another kind of ultimate _dhamma_ [it means that by the time the earth element occurs, it is impossible to occur the perishing away of the water-element or by the time the contact (*phassa*) occurs, it is impossible to occur the perishing away of feeling (*vedanā*)], similarly by the time it is bending toward perishing phase, called the static phase occurs, there is no difference between ultimate _dhamma_. That moment bending toward perishing phase can be designated as _jarā_ (decaying). Therefore it is suitable to designate as **_jarā_** of one ultimate _dhamma_ uniquely. That kind of _jarā_ can be designated as momentary decaying (_khanika jarā_). It is right. — It is essential to non-difference between the arising and perishing phase of essence of ultimate _dhamma_, actually. If one accepts difference between them except non-different, a kind of misunderstanding that “another kind of ultimate _dhamma_ arises while another kind of ultimate _dhamma_ perishes away”, can be occurred in those person who prefers difference between them. Therefore it should be recognized on the fact that with regarding to that _jarā_, it is intended to say momentary decaying (**_khanika jarā_**) only, but not refer to old aging (**_jarā_**) which is applied in conventional truth (_vohāra sacca_), i.e., _pabandha_ _thiti_ _paññatti_ _jarā_ = the nature of old aging of being in the aspect of conventional truth. (_Mahātīkā_-1-343,344)

Due to presence of such three characteristics called arising – static – perishing away, the designation of five aggregates as _anicca_ (impermanence) would be occurred. The term _anicca_ is designated on those three characteristics with the result that after it would be said that “**_aniccatā_ _ti_ _tesamyeva uppāda vayaññathattam_** = _aniccatā_ means the arising, perishing away and static phase called _jarā_ of those five aggregates only, especially, in order to show the term _aniccatā_ refers to momentary cessation (_khanikā nirodha_), the commentator said that ‘**_huttvā abhāvo vā_**’ = the nature voidness after arising is also called _aniccatā_”. In that phrase, due to previous occurrence of the nature of arising before the nature of voidness, it would be said in addition to “_huttvā_ = after arising”. With regarding to the word, _huttvā_ = after arising, it would be clearly shown the fact that previous voidness occurs before the voidness (_a-bhāva_) called perishing away occurs. (_Mahātīkā_-1-344)

The meaning is that — the voidness (_a-bhāva_) are of two kinds: **_pāgabhāva_** which is a kind of voidances of corporeality and mentality before arising phase (_uppāda_) and **_viddhamsābhāva_** which is also another kind of voidances of corporeality and mentality after perishing phase. In the words, “_huttvā a-bhāvo vā_”, **_a-bhāvo_** refers to the meaning of **_viddhamsābhāva_** which is the nature of voidances of corporeality and mentality after perishing phase called **_vināsa a-bhāva_**. Then, owing to presence of the meaning, “corporeality and mentality arise from voidness called _a-bhāva_ before it arise”, of the word, **_huttvā_**, that word shows the fact that “the voidness of corporeality and mentality before arise (_a-bhāva_) is preceding one while “the voidness of corporeality and mentality after perishing phase” is succeeding one.

Corporeality and mentality are void before it arise and after perished away. Thus these are the nature of _dhamma_ which is occurring temporarily as the arising phase, (_uppāda_), static phase(_thiti_), perishing phase (_bhaṅga_), between two kinds of voidness. Those five kinds of aggregates are only impermanent _dhamma_ (_anicca_), and the **_meditatior_** who wants to discern repeatedly as _anicca_, must

1. know five aggregates which are ultimate realities occurring in three periods, two continuums,
1. know causal _dhamma_ occurring in three periods of those five aggregates, as they really are, 3. know
    1. mode of dissolution after arising
    1. modes of perishing away in every moment called _anicca_ of five aggregates associating with causal _dhamma_,

\4. practise by seeing mode of impermanence and by generalizing as _anicca_, in order to fulfil the occurrence of in-breath and out-breath. \*

_PAGE-324_

If it would be practiced in that way it can be said that _aniccānupassanā_ knowledge had been fulfilled thoroughly. The **_meditatior_** with that _aniccānupassanā_ knowledge can be designated as the person of _aniccā_ _nupassī_, indeed.

##### **_(2) Virāgānupassī_**

` `In the word, **_viraganupassī_**, there are two kinds of **_virāga, viz,_**

1. **_khaya virāga_** which is perpetual momentary destruction called **_khaṇabhanga_** of conditioned things,
1. **_accanta virāga_** which is **_nibbāna_**, the cessation of passion **_(rāga)_** or conditioned things. The **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge which is occurred by means of discerning on only phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things is designated as **_virāga nupassanā_**. The noble Path Knowledge which is occurred by means of seeing on **_nibbāna_** called **_accantavirāga_**, is also known as **_virāgā nupassanā._** It should be recognized on the fact that if the person fulfils the occurrence of in-breath and out-breath by completion with those two kinds of knowledge of **_virāgā nupassanā_**, he practises as "**_virāgā nupassī assasissami passassissamiti sikkhati_**".**_(Vs-1-282)_**

**_Vipassanā_** Knowledge which discerns on the phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things over and over again is called **_khāya virāgā nupassanā._** The Noble Pathknowledge which sees **_nibbāna_** that is void and cessation of passion (**_rāga_**) is called **_accantavirāga nupassanā._**

In other words: — The _vipassanā_ knowledge, due to capability to discern as three general characters by taking the object of momentary dissolution of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_, occurs continuously by means of **_khaya_ _virāgā_ _nupassanā_**. Due to bending toward the eternal peace, _nibbāna_ called _asaṅkhata_, the _vipassanā_ knowledge occurs by means of **_accanta_ _virāgā_ _nupassanā_** simultaneously.

The noble Path-Knowledge is penetratively knowing and seeing the eternal peace, _nibbāna_, called _asaṅkhata_ where all kinds of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ are totally ceased, with the help of non-delusion (_a-sammoha_). That noble Path-Knowledge which is taking the object of _nibbāna_, eradicates deluding _dhamma_ which covers _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ and prohibits dissolution of those _dhamma_, without any remain. Due to eradication of delusion which is incapable of knowing the dissolution of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_, the knowledge (_vijjā_) which is knowing it, had been fulfilled as it’s function (_kicca siddhi_). That kind of knowing by means of it’s function, can be designated as knowing with non-delusion (_a-sammoha_). Due to eradication of delusion (_moha_), if dissolution of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ are discerned again, it will be known every time indeed. That kind of knowing can be designated as _khaya_ _virāgā_ _nupassanā_ which always discerning on dissolution of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ by means of nondelusion.

Therefore, the noble Path-Knowledge would be occurred by means of _khaya_ _virāgā_ _nupassanā_ which discerns dissolution of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ by means of non-delusion. It should be recognized on the fact that owing to ability of discerning on _nibbāna_ called _asaṅkhata_ where all kinds of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ are totally ceased, where lust (_rāga_) are totally ceased, by means of facing with the object directly, the noble Path-Knowledge occurs by means of _accanta_ _virāgā_ _nupassanā_, actually. (_Mahātīkā_-1-344)

#### **PAGE-325**

##### **(3) _nirodhā_ _nupassī_**

` `In this word, **_nirodhā nupassī_,** there are two kinds of cessation (**_nirodha_**), viz,

1. **_khaya nirodhā_** which is perpetual phenomena of momentary cessation called **_khaṇabhanga_** of conditioned things,
1. **_accanta nirodhā_** which is **_nibbāna_**, due to occurrence of real and total cessation of passion (_rāga_)

**_Vipassanā_** knowledge, which discerns perpttual phenomena of momentary cessation of conditioned things, is called **_nirodhā nupassanā._** Those are kinds of **_Vipassanā_** knowledge which discern as **_anicca, dukkha, anatta_**, by taking the object of perpetual phenomena of cessation of conditioned things. Actually, the Noble Path-knowledge, which knows and sees the Unconditioned Element, eternal peace called **_nibbāna_** which is total cessation of passion (**_rāga)_**, is also called **_nirodhā nupassanā_**. The practising **_meditatior_** who has fulfilled with those tow kinds of knowledge **_Vipassanā_** knowledge and Noble Path-knowledge, is the person called **_nirodhā nupassc_**. It should be recognized the fact that is the person fulfils the occurrence of in-breath and out-breath by completion with those two kinds of knowledge of **_nirodhā nupassanā_**, he practices as "**_nirodhā nupassī_** **_passasīssāmīti sikkhati". (Vs-1-282,Mahāṭī-1-344)_**
\*\*\*

##### **_(4) Paṭinissaggānupassī_**

In the word, _patinissaggā_ _nupassī_, there are two kinds of abandoning (_patinissaggā_);

(1) **_pariccāga_ _patinissaggā_** (2) **_pakkhandana_ _patinissaggā_**.

Those _vipassanā_ knowledge and noble Path-Knowledge which are capable of abandoning defilements, are called _patinissaggā_ _nupassanā_.

**_vipassanā_** — _Aniccānupassanā_ knowledge which is repeated discerning as _anicca_ by taking the object of dissolution of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_, abandons wrong perception called perception of permanence (_nicca saññā_) which falls on _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ by means of temporary abandoning (_tadaṅga_ _pahāna_). Those defilements which are led by ignorance, craving and clinging, called _kilesa_ _vatta_, those wholesome and unwholesome actions (_kusala_, _akusala_ _kamma_) called _saṅkhāra_ which are caused by that _kilesa_ _vatta_, which are capable of forming new existence, such resultant aggregates (_vipāka_ _khandha_) which are caused by that _kilesa_ _vatta_ and _kamma_ _vatta_ called _abhi_ _saṅkhāra_, can be occurred in future by means of obsession as permanence (_nicca_). If the mode of discerning as impermanence (_anicca_) on dissolution process of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ occurs continuously, it abandons all kinds of those _kilesa_ _vatta_, _kamma_ _vatta_ and resultant aggregates called _vipāka_ _vatta_ by means of **nonreoccurrable again in future**.

Those _kilesa_ _vatta_, _kamma_ _vatta_ resultant aggregates called _vipāka_ _vatta_, which are caused by perception of happiness (_sukha_ _saññā_) and perception of self (_atta_ _saññā_), are abandoned by means of temporarily and non-reoccurrable again in future during _vipassanā_ practice through which _dukkha_ _nupassanā_ knowledge which takes the object of nature of being oppressed by continuous dissolution and perishing away of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_, abandons the perception of happiness, while _anattā_ _nupassanā_ knowledge which takes the object of nature of lack of “self” which is non-destructible essence in those perishing _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ abandons the perception of self (_atta_ _saññā_), occurs continuously in him. Then, due to knowing and seeing faults of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ really, i.e., the fault of impermanence, the fault of suffering, the fault of non-self, the fault of loathsomeness (_asubha_) of all _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ called _saṅkhata_, which are situated in three worlds, viz, sensuous world, fine-material world and immaterial world, it usually be occurred as entering into eternal peace, _nibbāna_ called _a-saṅkhata_ _dhātu_ by means of bending toward and inclination to that _nibbāna_ which is opposite _dhamma_ of _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_.

The _vipassanā_ knowledge can, therefore, be designated as _pariccāga_ _patinissaggā_, due to ability to abandon defilements together with resultant aggregates, _abhi_ _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_ temporarily. Due to occurrence of entering into _nibbāna_ by bending toward it, it is also designated as _pakkhandana_ _patinissaggā_.

#### **PAGE-326**

If those defilements would be abandoned by eradication (_samuccheda_) without any remain, the noble Path-Knowledge not only abandons both wholesome, unwholesome actions called _abhi_ _saṅkhāra_, which are capable of forming new existence, and the resultant aggregates which are caused by those defilements and _abhi_ _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_, by means of making a condition which is incapable of reoccurrable in future again, but also enters into eternal peace, _nibbāna_ called _a-saṅkhata_ _dhātu_, by means of facing with _nibbāna_ as it’s object. That noble Path-Knowledge can, therefore, be designated as both **_pariccāga_ _patinissaggā_** = the _dhamma_ which is able to abandon permanently defilements with aggregates, _abhi_ _saṅkhāra_ _dhamma_, and **_pakkhandana_ _patinissaggā_** = the _dhamma_ which is able to enter into eternal peace, _nibbāna_ called _a-saṅkhata_ _dhātu_ by taking as it’s object. Those two kinds of knowledge: _vipassanā_ knowledge and noble Path-Knowledge would be designated as _anupassanā_ due to ability to follow preceding knowledge and take the object of preceding knowledge and due to ability to discern repeatedly on those preceding knowledge successively.

The meaning is that — the _vipassanā_ knowledge repeated discerns as _anicca_, _dukkha_, _anatta_ by taking the object of preceding _vipassanā_ knowledge, which are always arising and passing away so-called mode of impermanence (_anicca_) etc. Then the succeeding _vipassanā_ knowledge repeatedly discerns as _anicca_, _dukkha_, _anatta_ by taking the object of arising and passing away processes of preceding _vipassanā_ knowledge. Therefore it would be said _anupassanā_. The noble Path-Knowledge, indeed, would also be designated as _anupassanā_, due to ability to follow _gottrabhu_ and discern _nibbāna_ which is the object of _gottrabhu_. It should be recognized on the fact that the person who completed with those two kinds of knowledge: _vipassanā_ knowledge and noble Path-Knowledge in order to fulfil the occurrence of in-breath and out-breath, can be said that he practised as “_patinissaggā_ _nupassī_ _assasissāmīti_ _sikkhati_, _patinissaggā_ _nupassī_ _passasissāmīti_ _sikkhati_”. (_Visuddhi_-1-282;

_Mahātīkā_-1-345)

This is the instruction of the Buddha in order to fulfil occurrence of in-breath and outbreath by arising _vipassanā_ knowledge and Path-Knowledge successively.

##### **3.19** _Suddha **vipassanā**_ **and _samatha vipassanā_**

These fourth trtrad instructions are preached by the Buddha through pure **_vipassanā_** practice **_(suddha vipassanā)_**, while first, second and third tetrads instructions are preached through mixed modes of **_samatha_**and **_vipassanā_** practice. **_(Vs-1-282)_**

According to above exegeses, the practicing **_meditatior_**, who wants to fulfil the fourth tetrad instructions, has to practise in order to become these persons,

##### **_1. aniccānupassī, 2. viragānupassī, 3. nirodhānupassī,_**

**_4. paṭinissaggānupassī,_** respectively.\*\*\*

For the purpose to become **_anicānupassī_** person, the **_meditatior_** has to discern as **_anicca_** by taking the object of pehnomena of momentary perishing away of conditioned things which are occurring in (11) modes of situation, past, future, present etc. Groups of mental **_dhamma_** of great wholesome impulsions of mind-door congnitive processes which is called **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge, must be discerned as **_anicca_** again. However, supporting factors of efficiency of relation of determinative dependence **_(upanissaya paccaya)_** of **_dukkhānupassanā ñāṇa_** and **_anattānupassanā ñāṇa_** are also essential for occurrence of sharp and clear **_aniccānupassanā ñāṇa._** Therefore both those conditioned things and discerning **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge must be discerned by generalizing of three characters as mentioned previously.

Furthermore, due to inability to reach to the Noble Path-knowledge but at the stage of knowledge of Dissolution only, the **_meditatior_** is unable to discern the Unconditioned Element, **_nibbanā_**, which is designated as **_accantavirāga, accantanirodha, pariccāga paṭinissagga, pakkhandana paṭinissagga._** In this stage, therefore, the **_meditatior_** has to discerns on all three
\*\*

#### **PAGE-327**

\*\*

kinds of general characters, **_anicca, dukkha, anatta_** by taking the object of perpetual phenomena of momentary perishing away of conditioned things, in order to become **_viragānupassī_** person, **_nirodhānupassī_** person, **_paṭinissaggānupassī_** person. Those preceding **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge must be discerned as **_anicca, dukkha, anatta_** again.

If **_vipassanā_** practise can be performed in that way, **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge of such **_meditatior_** can abandon temporarily **_(tadangapahāna)_** on

1. defilements, especially passion **_(rāga)_**,
1. **_abhisaṅkhāra dhamma_**, which is capable of providing occurrence of new existence, which has the source of those defilement round **_(kileas vaṭṭa)_**, and
1. consequence aggregates **_(vipāka khandhā)_** which will be originated from those **_abhisaṅkhāra dhamma_** consequently. Thus, it should be recognized on practice of mindfulness of breathing by means of (16) kinds of depended foundations (4x4=16, through four tetrads). In this way this practice of mindfulness through (16) kinds of depended foundations. **_(Vs-1-282)_**

There are (16) kinds of modes for each in-breath and out-breath, totally (32) kinds of modes of breathing. If those modes of breathing are proficiently carried out, it can give rise to the final goal of Buddhism, **_nibbāna_**, the eternal peace. Can a person who thinks himself as practicing **_meditatior_** breathe systematically in accordance with the Buddha's teaching? The way of practice founded by the Buddha is always worth inviting to practice for every person, everywhere, every time really. Noble Doctrines are finally proved and completed with nobility called **_sandiṭṭhika_**, which is worth knowing and seeing by experiential knowledge of Noble Disciples. If one who endeavours, he can become the Buddha. So try hard all the time!

##### **3.20 It reaches into fourth stage of practice of "_saṭipaṭṭhāna_"**

Thus, the meditating person who discerns the ultimate nature of both corporealities and mentalities by taking the object of phenomena of perishing away of conditioned things and preceding **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge, but not by taking the object of corporeal and mental units anymore, it reaches into fourth stage of practice of **_saṭipaṭṭhāna._**

##### **_(M-1-75)(M-1-76)(M-1-78)_**

` `The mindfulness (associating with **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge) on the fact that …

“There are no man, woman, person, being, human being, heavenly being, brahma; there are no massive body with vitality, massive body with consciousness, **_prama atta_** who is creator, living **_atta_** who is created; there are only masses of corporealities and mentalities called **_kāya-vedanā-citta-dhamma_**; there are only groups of causal **_dhammas;_** and resultant **_dhammas;_** there are only groups of impermanent **_dhammas;_** suffering **_dhammas_** non-self **_dhammas”_** appears in the continuum of that **_meditatior_**. That mindfulness occurs for successive improvement of **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge and that mindfulness itself. **_(M-1-71, MA-1-255)_**

Upper and upper kinds of **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge from beginning of this knowledge of Dissolution, are the knowledge that take the object of pure phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things. Therefore, the **_meditatior_** has to discern the pure phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things over and over again in order to improve **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge and mindfulness associating with **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge successively.

###### **3.21 Discerning through deportment-clear comprehension _(iriyāpatha-sampajañña)_**

In this stage, the practicing **_meditatior_** should like to discern on the way of deportment **_(iriyāpatha)_**, clear comprehension **_(sampajañña)_** in order to attain very sharp and clear **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge.

During walking, as mentioned previously, after developing on concentration, corporeal **_dhammas_** which are capable of conveying and corporeal **_dhammas_** which are conveyed, mental **_dhammas_** which are causes of arising of those corporeal **_dhammas_**, and remaining miscellaneous conditioned things must be kept in mind and **_Vipassanā_** practice must be performed by taking the object of pure phenomenon of perishing away of those conditioned things through various methods, twofold corporeality and mentality method, fivefold aggregate method etc. It must be discerned similarly for the purpose of upper **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge.

From this knowledge of Dissolution to the upper kinds of **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge, the **_meditatior_** never see form and shape called **_saviggaha_** but pure ultimate nature of corporealities and mentalities only by insight. Each knowledge of Contemplation **_(anupassanā ñāṇa)_** will remove respective defilements and opposite **_dhammas_** efficiently.

#### **4a. Section of Knowledge of Terror _(bhayatupaṭṭhāna ñāṇa)_**

##### **1. The meaning of knowledge of Terror _(bhaya ñāṇa)_**\*

In the continuum of that **_meditator_** who performs, practises, develops respectfully on the advancement of knowledge of Dissolution, which has the object of momentary cessation called the phenomenon of destruction, the phenomenon of decaying, the phenomenon of breaking down of all conditioned things occurring in three periods, past, future and present, and tow continuums, internal and external, over and over again as mentioned previous way, every conditioned thing occurring (31) realms appears as fearful occurrence.

##### **_Pāli Quotation (Vs-2-282)_**

In the continuum of practising **_meditatior_** who discerns and reasons as ... "those past conditioned things had been ceased, present conditioned things are ceasing, the future ones will cease"...
through the object of phenomenon of destruction is taken as priority, the knowledge called **_bhayatupaṭṭhāna_** which is capable of taking object that deserves to be fearful, appears well. **_(Vs-2-282)_**

**2. Does the person with knowledge of Terror fear?**
\*\*

##### **_Pāli Quotation_ _(Vs-2-283) (Mahāṭī-2-446)_**

If it is a question whether the person with knowledge of Terror fears, it would be answered that "he doesn't".
It is because the knowledge never occur with the nature of fear indeed.
It is right.
A kind of fear occurs by means of arising of consciousness rooted in hate, which is associating with ill will **_(paṭigha)_**.
The knowledge of Terror, however, knows that "fearful objects are worth fearing" as they really are.
It is right.
That knowledge of Terror reasons as ... "those past conditioned things had been ceased, present conditioned things are ceasing, the future ones will cease".. only.

#### **PAGE - 331**

##### 3. The meaning of present _(paccuppanna)_

Those conditioned things which belong to **_addha_** presentt, the period separated by one life between process of **n**ewly **o**ccurrence of **n**ext **e**xistence (NONE) called **_paṭisandhi_** and death, are gross and rough due to presence of long duration.
Those conditioned things which belong to momentary present **_(khaṇa pacccuppanna)_**, on the other hand, are especially, subtle and fine due to presence of short span.
Conditioned things which belong to continuity present **_(santati paccuppanna)_** are middle ones which are worth discerning as beginning objects of the knowledge of Terror.
**_(Mahāṭī-2-445)_**

In this case, the **_meditatior_** should not suggest that those **_dhammas_** belong to **_addhā_** present and momentary present are not worth discerning.
It means that after discerning on conditioned things belong to continuity present beforehand, **_vipassanā_** practice must be perform to reach the momentary present.
Only when way of discernment is accomplished in that way, masses of corporeality and mentality called **_rūpaghana_** (compactness of corporeality) **_nāmaghana_** (compactness of mentality) will be broken down in the insight, resulting in reaching into the field of ultimate reality.
Afterwards upper kinds of **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge, knowledge of Dissolution etc., will be occurred consequently, if the meaning is interpreted in that way all explanations of previous stages of knowledge and later ones will be conformable to each other.
Although the knowledge of Dissolution can take the object of momentary cessation of conditioned things, if one suggests that the upper knowledge of Terror can take the object of conditioned things which belong to "continuity present" only, it will lead to misunderstanding on the knowledge of Terror as lower stage than the Knowledge of Dissolution, inverse.

When a such man with good sight sees three pits which are full of live coals near the gate of city, he himself is not afraid. it is right. \_\_\_\_ As a kind of reasoning that "all beings who fall into these pits with live coals will feel great suffering"

... occurs in the continuum of that man;
\_\_\_\_ similarly the knowledge of Terror is not afraid.
it is right.
\_\_\_\_ A kind of reasoning on three kinds of realms, **_kāma, rūpa, arūpa_**, which are similar to three pits with live coals and three skewers,  
\*\*\*

### **_PAGE-332_**

that “those past conditioned things had been ceased, present conditioned things are ceasing, the future ones will cease…” is occurred by the knowledge of Terror.
Due to appearance of all kinds of conditioned things occurring in (31) realms, with the nature of great fearfulness and great dangerous ones, by the knowledge of Terror, that knowledge is worth designating as **_bhayatupaṭṭhāna ñāṇa. (Vs-2-283)_**
\*\*

#### **5. How the nature of fearfulness appears? _Pāli Quotation (Paṭisam-258, Vs-2-283)_**

The term, **_nimitta_**, means **_saṇkhāra nimitta_** (= form of conditioned things). The appearance as form and shape of conditioned things occurring in past, future, present, by means of both masses of corporealities, masses of mentalities, **_samūha ghana_** etc., occurrence of specific acquired function of each **_dhammas_**, is known as **_saṇkhāra nimitta(Vs-2-284, Mahāṭī-2-447)._** In this stage of knowledge of Terror, due to inability to appear as compactness of continuity **_(santati Ghana)_** resulting from finishing to discern up to momentary present, it should be recognized the fact that… “compactness of continuity” is excluded to explain.

The cyclic **_dhammas_** called continuity of corporeality-mentality which are cease occurring in existences of sensuous sphere, fine-material sphere and immaterial sphere, are called **_“pavatta”_**. Actually, every kind of arising of existence called **_bhavapavatti_** is designated as **_“pavatta”_**. However due to obvious appearance of the nature of being oppressed by perpetual phenomena of arising and perishing away through the knowledge of Dissolution, even existences of fine material and immaterial sphere which are worth saying as subtle and quiescent bliss, would be appeared as the nature of fearful ones as they really are. With intention to show this meaning, the term, **_pavatta,_** is explained as “arising of existences in fine-material sphere and immaterial sphere” **_(bhava pavatti)_**, in the commentary called **_Visuddhi Magga. (Mahāṭī-2-447)_**

1. For the practising **_meditatior_** whotakes into heart all conditioned things, as **_anicca_**, the form of conditioned things **_(mimitta = saṅkhāra nimitta)_** appears as fearful danger.
1. For the practising **_meditatior_** who takes into heart all conditioned things, as **_dukkha_**, every kind of arising of existence called **_bhava pavatta_** appear as fearful danger.
1. For the practising **_meditatior_** who takes into heart all conditioned things, as **_anatta_**, both the form of conditioned things, as **_annata,_** both the form of conditioned things and **_(sañkhāra nimitta)_** and every kind of arising of existence called **_bhava pavatta_** appear as fearful danger. The practising **_meditatior_** who takes into heart conditioned things as **_anicca_**, always sees death **_(maraṇa)_** called only the phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things resulting in appearance of form of conditioned things

#### **PAGE-333**

as fearful danger. The practising **_meditatior_** who takes into heart conditioned things, as **_dukkha_**, always sees only the phenomenon of being oppressed by perpetual processes of arising and perishing away of arising of corporeal and mental aggregates **_(bhava pavatti)_** of fine material sphere and immaterial sphere which are worth designating as blissful realms, resulting in appearance of arising of existence in those spheres as **_meditatior_** who takes into heart conditioned things, as **_anatta_**, always see on both form of conditioned things **_(nimitta)_** and origination of existence **_(pavatta)_** as an empty village without beings or as mirage, or as heavenly city created by **_gandhabba_** resulting in reasoning as void of self, vanity of essence of self, emptyness of self, absence of master called self, absence of chief called self. Therefore for that practising **_meditatior_**, both kinds of **_nimitta_** and **_pavatta_** appear as fearful danger really.

**6. Object of the knowledge of Terror**

##### ` `**_Pāli Quotation (Vs-2-284)_**

According to exegesis of above commentary, those **_dhammas_** which are objects of the knowledge of Terror are also all kinds of conditioned things occurring in three periods, past, future, present and two kinds of continuum, internal and external, similar to objects of previous kinds of **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge.

Therefore, the **_meditatior_** has to perform **_vipassanā_** practice by taking the object of phenomena of perishing away of internal corporealities sometimes, or of external corporealities sometimes. On of internal mentalities sometimes, on of external mentalities sometimes. It must be reasoned as **_anicca_** sometimes, **_dukkha_** sometimes, **_anatta_** sometimes alternatively. Sometimes **_vipassanā_** practice must be carried out by taking object of phenomena of perishing away of factors of dependent-origination. Sometimes, discerning **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge must be discerned as **_anicca, dukkha, anatta_** again.

#### **4.B Section of knowledge of Danger _(ādīnava nupassanā ñāṇa)_**

For the **_meditatior_** who performs, practises, develops over and over again for the advancement of knowledge of Terror, the protective **_dhammas_**, which is capable of protecting from harmful results, arising-static phase-perishing phase called **_jāti-jarā-maraṇa_** with the sources of conditioned things in (31) realms, never appears in his insight. Every kind of arising of existence ha the same occurrence of danger called impermanence, change and alteration indeed. The refuge for protection of danger, birth-aging-death with the source of conditioned things, can not e appeared in him. The place for fleeing from danger, birth-agingdeath with the source of conditioned things, can not be appeared in him. Someone to rely on for the protection of danger, birth-aging-death with the source of conditioned things, can not be appeared in him. Either desire to nay kind of conditioned things among conditioned things occurring in all kinds of existence or wrong reasoning as "**_eso me attā_** = my self," never arise in him.

1. Three kinds of realms, **_kāma, rūpa, arūpa_**, appears as three pits full of live coals without flame.
1. Four great elements appear as highly poisonous snakes, rapid venomous snakes.
1. Five aggregates appear as five murderers with four-edged daggers who are following behind him.
1. Six kinds of internal bases appear as deserted villages where are void of beings.
1. Six kinds of external bases appear as robbers who destroy the village.
1. All kinds of existences appear as the process of burning by (11) kinds of fire called fire of passion, fire of anger, fire of delusion, fire of birth, fire of aging, fire of death, fire of sorrow, fire of lamentation, fire of suffering, fire of mentally disagreeable feeling, fire of woe, or on as burning with flame surrounding by ten directions, or as blazing simultaneously.
1. All kinds of conditioned things appear as open sore, various kinds of wounds, arrows, leading to harmful effects, incurable disease, bulk of dangers due to void of pleasurable nature but full of suffering, due to presence of final result of destruction .

dissolution, this practising **_meditatior_** sees the danger called void of completion of all surroundings, void of pleasurable situation, occurrence with ceaseless disastrous destruction. For that **_meditatior_** who discerns in this way, the knowledge of Danger called **_ādīnava ñāṇa = ādīnava nupassanā ñāṇa,_** which is capable of discerning on disastrous danger of conditioned things, appears well.**_(Vs-2-284)_**

**1. Preaching found in _Paṭisambhidā Magga_**

##### ` `**_Pāli Quotation (Paṭisam-56,58, Vs-2-286)_**

In this section of knowledge of Danger, preaching found in **_Paṭisambhidā Magga_** will be presented in brief. In this section ten phenomena, viz, **_uppāda, pavatta, mimitta, āyūhava, paṭisandhi, anuppāda, appavatta, animitta, anāyūhanā, appaṭisandhi,_** should be memorized well.

1. **_uppāda_** \_\_\_\_ Due to previous action **_(kamma)_**, the arising of conditioned things called aggregates of consequence round **_(vipāka vaṭṭa)_** in recent life, is fearful danger. Thus, the reason which occurs through appearance as fearful danger of conditioned things is called **_ādīnavanupassanā ñāṇa_** which is capable of discerning on danger of conditioned things.
1. **_pavatta_** \_\_\_\_ During life , **_(pavatti),_** successive occurrence of conditioned things is fearful danger … R…
1. **_nimitta_** \_\_\_\_ Phenomenon of conditioned things **_(saṅkhāra nimitta)_** is fearful danger … R

…

1. **_āyūhana_** \_\_\_\_ The action **_(kamma)_** which is the source of process of NONE **_(paṭisandhi)_** in future, is fearful danger … R …
1. **_paṭisandhi_** \_\_\_\_ The process of NONE **_(paṭisandhi)_** in future, is fearful danger … R … Five kinds of existences which are the occurrence of process of NONE, are fearful danger … R … The arising of all kinds of aggregates is … R … The arising of consequent **_dhammas (upapatti)_** is … R … The birth is … R … The aging is … R … The decaying is … R … The death is … R … The sonnour is … R … The lamentation is … R … The woe is fearful danger. Thus the reason which occurs through appearance as fearful danger of conditioned things is called **_ādīnavānupassanā ñāṇa,_** which is capable of discerning on danger of conditioned things. This is the first connection **_(vāra). (Paṭisam-56)_**

Among these preaching of **_Paṭisambhidā Magga,_** only these five kinds, viz, **_uppāda, pavatta, nimitta, āyūhana; paṭisandi_**, are preached by means of the ground of that **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge, i.e., those are worth designating as objects of **_ādīnavānupassanā ñāṇa_** in verses. The remaining ones, five kinds of existence **_(gati)_** etc., are

#### **PAGE-336**

preached by means of indirect way **_(pariyāya)_** of those five kinds. It is right.\_\_\_\_ These two words, **_nibbatti_** and **_jāti_** are indirect usage of the words **_uppāda_** and **_paṭisandi;_** while these two words, **_gati_** and **_upapatti,_** are indirect usage of the word, **_pavatta_**; and these words, **_jarā, vyādhi, maraṇa, soka, parideva, upāyāsa,_** are indirect usage of the word, **_nimitta_** respectively. It should be recognized in this way. **_(Vs-2-286)_**

1. **_anupāda_** \_\_\_\_ The reason which understand that “**_nibbāna_** which lacks phenomenon of arising, (in the next method) **_nibbāna_** which is cause of non-reoccurrence of conditioned things in future, has no danger,” is called the knowledge that arises depending on **_nibbāna._**
1. **_appavatta_** \_\_\_\_ The reason which understands that “**_nibbāna_** which lacks **_pavatta_** (in the next method) **_nibbāna_** which is cause of lack of **_pavatt,_** …R…
1. **_animitta_** \_\_\_\_ The reason which understands that “**_nibbāna_** which lacks **_nimitta_** (in the next method) **_nibbāna_** which is cause of lack of **_nimitta,_** …R…
1. **_anāyūhanā_** \_\_\_\_ The reason which understands that “**_nibbāna_** which lacks **_āyūhana_** (in the next method) **_nibbāna_** which is cause of lack of **_āyūhana,_** …R…
1. **_apaṭisandhi_** \_\_\_\_ The reason which understands that “**_nibbāna_** which lacks **_paṭisandhi_** (in the next method) **_nibbāna_** which is cause of lack of **_paṭisandhi,_** …R… **_anupāyāsa_** \_\_\_\_ The reason which understands that “**_nibbāna_** which lacks **_upāyāsa_** (in the next method) **_nibbāna_** which is cause of lack of **_upāyāsa,_** has no danger”, is called the knowledge that arises depending on **_nibbāna_**. **_(Paṭisam-57)_**. This is the second connection **_(vāra)_**.

This second connection is preached in order to show the knowledge which the object that is opposite of object of **_ādīnava ñāṇa_** and in order to show opposite nature that “the phenomenon of arising is absent in such **_dhammas_**, that **_dhammas_** is totally absence of fearful danger”. In other words, this second connection is preached for gentlemen with knowledge of Terror through seeing on danger of conditioned things, in order to be relieved the tension that “the **_dhammas_**, which is void of danger, which is finishing of faults, is also present”. In the next method \_\_\_\_ for that practicing **_meditatior_**, those **_dhammas,_** **_uppāda_** etc., appear as fearful danger. Afterwards, for that practicing **_meditatior_**, inclination towards “**_abhaya_**” which is opposite of fearful danger, appears consequently. This is because \_\_\_\_ as inclination towards peace can be occurred obviously in the person who is suppressed by worry, the knowledge of Desire for Deliverance **_(muñcitukamyatā ñāṇa)_** appears consequently after seeing danger of conditioned things. Therefore it should be recognized the fact that this second connection is preached in order to show advantages of **_ādīnava nupassanā ñāṇa_**, which sees danger of conditioned things, which is accomplished through appearance of conditioned things as fearful danger.

**_uppāda, anuppāda_** \_\_\_\_ The reason which understands that, “the arising of conditioned things is fearful danger; **_nibbāna_**, which lacks phenomenon of arising of conditioned things, (in the next method) **_nibbāna_** which is cause of lacking in phenomenon of arising of

#### **PAGE-337**

conditioned things, is absence of danger”, is called the knowledge which occurs depending on the deathless element, **_nibbāna_** … R …

The reason which understands that, “**_upāyāsa_** (= woe) is fearful danger; **_nibbāna_**, which lacks **_upāyāsa_**, (in the next method) **_nibbāna_** which is cause of lacking in **_upāyāsa_**, is absence of danger”, is called the knowledge which occurs depending on the deathless element, **_nibbāna_**. This is the third connection, indeed.

` `The first connection is **_pavatti._**

Depending on **_pavatti_**, the occurrence of knowledge of Danger is shown. The second connection is **_nivatti_**. Depending on **_navatti_**, beneficial effect is shown. Bu means of persons who endeavours **_vipassanā_** practice strenuously through seeing beneficial effect on **_nivatti_** contiguously after seeing danger on **_pavatti_** \_\_\_\_ this third condition, which shows the fact that “**_uppādo bhayam, anuppādo khemam =_** the arising of conditioned things is fearful denger; **_nibbāna_**, which lacks phenomenon of arising of conditioned things (in the next method) **_nibbāna_**, which is cause of lacking in phenomenon of arising of conditioned things, is absence of danger” etc., has been accomplished. It should be recognized on the sixth connection **_(chaṭṭha vāra)_** etc., similarly. **_(Mahāṭī-2-449)_**

**_Gati_** \_\_\_\_ The term, **_gati_** means consequence mental aggregates and corporeallities produced by **_kamma_**, which are worth designating as existence produced by various kinds of actions **_(kamma)_**, in the aspect of ultimate sense basically. Among these terms, with refering to these terms, **_uppāda, pavatta, āyūhana_** conditioned things belongs to present period (during one life from beginning of process of NONE to death), should be interpreted. With refering to the term, **_paṭisandhi,_** those aggregates of **_uppādinnaka_**, which are produced by action, which belongs to future period, should be interpreted. With refering to the term, **_uppāda_**, action **_(kamma)_** and **_kamma_**-formation, which belong to past period, should be extracted. With refering to the term, **_nimita_**, on the other hand, all kinds of conditioned things belong to corporealities and mentalities occurring in three periods, past, future, present and two kinds of continuum, internal and external, should be interpreted. **_(Mahāṭī-2-449,450)_**

##### **_2. dukkha-sāmisa-saṅkhāra_**

` `In this Pāli Text, those **_dhammas, uppāda_** etc., are fearful danger. Those **_dhammas_** with fearful danger are permanently **_dukkha_** (= suffering) indeed. Those **_dhammas, uppāda_** etc., with the nature of fearful danger which is permanent suffering, always occur together with **_āmisa_** (= desirable ones) due to inevitable occurrence from **_(1) vaṭṭāmisa (2)lokāmisa_**

##### **_(3)kilesāmisa. (Vs-2-287)_**

\*\*\*

**1._vuṭṭamisa_** \_\_\_\_ Noble teachers said that mundane consequence mental aggregates and corporealities produce by **_kamma (upādinnakkhandhā)_**, which are produced by actions of previous lives, are called **_vaṭṭāmisa_** (desirable rounds). Three kind of round, defilement round **_(kilesa vaṭṭa)_**, action round **_(kamma vaṭṭa)_**, consequence round **_(vipāka vaṭṭa)_**, and **_dhammas_** that depends on those rounds are called **_vaṭṭāmisa_** (desirable rounds).**_(Mahāṭī-2-450)_**

**2. _lokāmisa_**\_\_\_\_ Due to occurrence of deserving to reason as “I, mine” etc., by defilements, selfish desire, anger, delusion etc., five kinds of sensual pleasure called visible object, auditory object, olfactory object, sapid object, tactile object, are called **_lokāmisa_** (desirable worldly pleasures). Those are **_dhammas_** which are ground, crushed, eaten by defilements. **_(Mahāṭī-2-450)_**

#### **PAGE-338**

**3. _kilesāmisa_** \_\_\_\_ Those defilements, selfish desire, anger, delusion, etc., are called **_kilesāmisa_** (= desirable defilements). **_(Mahāṭī-2-450)_**

Such phenomena, arising **_(uppāda_** etc., occur together with **_sāmisa = āmisa_** (desirable ones). Those **_dhammas_** with **_āmisa, ‘uppāda’_**, etc., are merely mundane conditioned things **_(saṅkhāra mattameva)_** only **_(Vs-2-287)_**

In this term, with **_saṅkhāra mattameva_**, with regarding to suffix “**_eva=_**only”, **_nibbāna_**, which is worth designating as **_visaṅkhāra,_** would be rejected. This is because \_\_\_\_ in that **_nibbāna_** which is **_visaṅkhāra_**, there is no trace of occurrence of **_sāmisa_**. With regarding to the suffix, “**_matta_** = merely”, incomplete conditioned things are shown obviously. This is because all kinds of conditioned things with the phenomena of arising and perishing away never occur together with **_āmisa_**. These also include Noble Path and Fruit which are not associating with **_āmisa_**. In this case it must be interpreted on mundane conditioned things only. **_(Mahāṭī-2-450)_**

Due to occurrence of suffering etc., of those **_dhammas, uppāda_** etc., which are designating as danger, these words, **_“uppādo dukkhanti bhayatupaṭṭhāne paññā ādīnave ñāṅam”_**, etc., are preach in the Pāli Text called **_Paṭisambhidā Magga_**. In this case, although the meaning called nature of suffering can be finished by any one word \_\_\_\_ it should be recognized on the significance of knowledge of these words by means of significant occurrence of knowledge through…

1. **_bhayākāra_** = the occurrence of fearful nature
1. **_dukkhākāra_** = the nature of suffering,
1. **_sāmisākāra_** = the occurrence together with **_āmisa_** simultaneously. **_(Vs-2-287)_**

As various kinds of knowledge of Contemplation, viz., **_anicca nupassanāñāṇa, dukkha nupassanāñāṇa, anatta nupassanāñāṇa_** are significant ones respectively by means of significant occurrence as **_anicca, dukkha, anatta_** of those conditioned things only, similarly it should be recognized significant occurrence of knowledge by means of significant modes called **_bhayākāra_** (nature of terror), **_dukkhākāra_** (nature of suffering), **_samisākāra_** (nature of desirable ones). Among those kind of nature **_(ākāra)_**, the knowledge that occurs through nature of terror **_(bhayākāra)_**, is called **_bhayatupṭṭhāñāṇa_** (knowledge of Terror) while the knowledge that occurs through nature of suffering (**_dukkhākāra_**) and nature of desirable ones **_(samisākāra)_**, is called **_ādīnavañāṇa_** (knowledge of Danger). **_(Mahāṭī-2450,451)_**

##### **3. Ten kinds of knowledge**

The practising **_meditatior_** with knowledge of Danger, realizes penetratively and faces with these ten kinds of knowledge, viz, five kinds of knowledge of Danger which occur by taking five kinds of phenomena called **_uppāda, pavatta, nimitta, āyūhana, paṭisandhi_** depending on which those knowledge of arise and five kinds of knowledge Quiescence **_(santipadañāṇa)_** which occur by taking five kinds of bases of knowledge called **_anuppāda, appavatta, animitta, anāyūhana, appaṭisandhi_** respectively. **_(Vs-2-2287)_**

One kind of knowledge can know another knowledge. However that knowledge can not know itself. There is a reasonable question that why it is said "**_dasa ñāṇe pajanati_** = ten kinds of knowledge are known". The answer is as follows. \_\_\_\_

` `In this case, the meaning of knowing is that \_\_\_\_ the knowledge that stands on objects of both **_uppāda, pavatta, nimitta, āyūhana, paṭisandhi_** and **_anuppāda, appavatta, animitta, anāyūhana, appaṭisandhi_**, lacks of bewilderments on those object exceedingly. Cloud of darkness of bewilderments and delusion have been removed well. Due to lack of bewilderments in that way, there is void of bewilderment on the knowledge itself. Therefore the knowledge seems to be known itself resulting in saying as "ten kinds of knowledge are known". **_(Mahāṭī-2-451)_**

The practising **_meditatior_** has to discern on the **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge that is discerning on, **_uppāda, pavatta_**,etc., again. If preceding **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge can be discerned by succeeding **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge again, it can be said that "**_dasa ñāṇa pajānāti_** = ten kinds of knowledge are known".

Due to occurrence of mastery in two kinds of knowledge, **_ādīnava ñāṇa_** and **_santipada ñāṇa_**, the practising **_meditatior_** is not shaken by various wrong views. **_(Paṭisam56,58)_**

Due to occurrence of finishing to see by **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge on **_pavatti_** called perpetual continuity of corporeality and mentality, the Noble **_dhammas_** called **_nibbāna_**, which is void of conditioned things as an opposite **_dhammas_** of that **_pavatti_**, appears in the insight after determining well. Therefore the mind of that **_meditatior_** is not shaken by wrong belief that "there is very superior and subtle **_nibbāna_** in the present body" etc., This is because \_\_\_\_ very fearful danger, which is worth seeing well is present in the continuity of corporeality and mentality really. Therefore it is explained that "the practising **_meditatior_** is not shaken by various wrong views". **_(Mahāṭī-2-451) Section of ādīnava nupassanā ñāṇa finished._**

##### **1. The knowledge of Disenchantment**

In this way, after discerning on all conditioned things occurring in three realms, **_kāmma, rūpa, arūpa_**, as fearful danger, that practising **_meditatior_** disenchant, displeases on all those conditioned things with the phenomenon of destruction in three realms. A comparable worldly simile is that \_\_\_\_ as the king of golden brahminic duck **_(hamsa)_** that pleases at the base of **_citta kuta_** mountain, westward of **_anotatta_** lake, displeases to stay dirty pond near the entrance of beggar's village but very satisfied to stay in seven big lakes \_\_\_\_ similarly the practising **_meditatior_** dissatisfies on all conditioned things occurring in three realms. Actually, due to presence of enchantment in practice only, he always enchants and pleases in seven kinds of contemplation, viz., **_aniccānupassanā, dukkhānupassanā, anattānupassanā, nibbdānupassanā, viragānupassanā, nirodhānupassanā, paṭinissaggānupassanā. (Vs-2-287)_**

Furthermore, as the king lion captured in the golden cage disenchants in that cage but satisfies in Himalaya Mountains extending about 2414 km (1,500 miles) \_\_\_\_ similarly this practising **_meditatior_** disenchants in three kinds of existences, existence in sensual sphere **_(kāmasugati)_**, existence in fine material sphere **_(rūpasugati)_**, existence in immaterial sphere **_(arūpasugati)_**, but satisfies and pleases in three kinds of contemplation, viz., **_aniccānupassanā, dukkhānupassanā, anattānupassanā_**, really. **_(Vs-2-288)_**

Furthermore, as the king elephant called **_chaddana,_** which is whole white body, which is possessing seven organs touching on to ground, viz, four limbs, tail, proboscis, male genital organs, which is able to fly in the sky, disenchants in the middle of city but enchants and pleases in the forest with Lake **_Chaddana_** of Himalalya Mountains \_\_\_\_ similarly, this practising **_meditatior_** dissatisfies and displeases in all kinds of conditioned things occurring in three realms. He enchants and pleases in the deathless element, **_nibbāna_**, which can be taken into heart beforehand in a way that "**_anuppado khemam = nibbāna_** which lacks arising of conditioned things, **_nibbāna_** which is cause of lacking in arising of conditioned things, is void of danger" etc., which can be seen by reasoning, which is called **_santipada_**, which is void of all kinds of conditioned things. Only the mind which inclines towards that **_santipada_**, which bends towards that **_santipada_** which slants towards that **_santipada_**, always occurs in him. **_(Vs2-288)_**

##### **2. Three kinds of knowledge with essential meaning**

These three kinds of knowledge, knowledge of Terror, knowledge of Danger, knowledge of Disenchantment are synonyms. Therefore olden day exegets Maha Theras said as follows. \_\_\_\_

` `The single knowledge of Terror has three different names.

1. Due to finishing to see all conditioned things as fearful terror, it is designated as knowledge of Terror **_(bhayatupaṭṭhana ñāṇa)._**
1. Due to ability to show obviously on the danger of those conditioned things, it is designated as knowledge of Danger (**_ādīnavānupassanā ñāṇa_** )
1. Due to occurrence of dissatisfaction on those conditioned things, it is designated as knowledge of Disenchantment (**_nibidānupassanā ñāṇa_**)

In the Pāli Text of **_Paṭisambhida Magga_**. It is also preached that "these three kinds of knowledge, **_bhayatupaṭṭhana ñāṇa, ādīnavānupassanā ñāṇa, nibidānupassanā ñāṇa_**, are

the same in meaning but varied in terminology only" (**_Paṭisam-259, Vs-2-288_**) **Section of _nibidānupassanā ñāṇa_ finished.**

#### **The Knowledge of Desire for Deliverance**

This gentleman or lady called **_ācārakulaputta_**, who disenchants on every kind of conditioned things, who disgusts and struggles against all conditioned things is not worth entangling on any kind of conditioned things, which are occurring in all existences of three realms, which are having perpetual ceaseless phenomena of perishing away. Deliverance from all kinds of conditioned things only is greatly desired. Emancipation from those ones only is greatly thirsted.

**Wordly simile** \_\_\_ As a fish captured in the net, a frog ingested into the buccal cavity of snake, a jungle fowl prisoned in the cage, a deer ensnared in the noose which is firmly tied, an elephant fallen into big marsh, a king of dragon ingested into buccal cavity of **Garuda**, the mythical king of birds, the moon eclipsed by **Rahu**, ascending node of moon, a man besieged by enemies … etc., want to release from respective bondage similarly, the mind of that practising **_meditatior_** desires for deliverance from all kinds of conditioned things occurring in three realms. Emancipation from those ones only is greatly thirsted. At that time, as mentioned above, in the continuum of that pracitsing **_meditatior_** who has no desite on all kinds of conditioned things but for deliverance only, the knowledge of Desire for Deliverance arises obviously. **_(Vs-2-288,289)_**

Various knowledge from the knowledge of dissolution to this knowledge of Desire for Deliverance are knowledge which are performing **_vipassanā_** practice by taking object of phenomena of perishing away only and discerning as **_anicca, dukkha, anatta_** alternatively. If **_vipassanā_** practice is accomplished by taking object of phenomena of perishing away of conditioned things occurring in three periods and two kinds of continuum, it should be recognized the fact that nomenclature of those kinds of knowledge is applied as

1. **_bhaya ñāṇa_** through appearance as fearful terror,
1. **_ādīnava ñāṇa_** through appearance as danger,
1. **_nibbidā ñāṇa_** through apperance as disenchantment,
1. **_muñcitukamyatā ñāṇa_** through apperance as desire for deliverance from conditioned things, respectively.

**6.1 Knowledge of Reflection**
\*\*\*

#### **_Pāli Auotation (Vs-2-289) (Mahāṭī-2-435)_**

In this way due to desire to deliverance from conditioned things with the phenomena of perishing away, which are occurring in all kinds of realms, mother's wombs (**_yoni_**), existences, standing places, beings (**_sattāvāsa_**), that **_meditatior_** performs again **_vipassanā_** practice by the knowledge of Reflection which discerns three general characters of those conditioned things, in order to deliver from all kinds of conditioned things, as follows: (**_Vs-2289_**)

The function of **_vipassanā_** practice through generalizing of three characters on conditioned things, is inevitable obligation in previous states of **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge. Therefore the exegete Sayadaw explained by using the word, **_puna_** = again. The performance of distinguishing and keeping in mind on conditioned things can be achieved by means of complete characters only. The exegete Sayadaw, therefore, explained that **_vipassanā_** practice has to be performed through generalizing of three characters (**_tilakkhaṇam āropetvā_**). **_(Mahāṭī-2-453)_**

According to these instructions, the **_meditatior_** has to perform **_vipassanā_** practice by taking object of phenomena of perishing away of conditioned things, so as to achieve brief method. After wards, detailed method called forty ways of advancement of knowledge should be performed in this stage again. However in this stage, the commentary called **_Visudhi_**

**_Magga_** explained sixty ways of advancement of knowledge viz.,

1. through the phenomenon of **_anicca_** = 14 ways
1. through the phenomenon of **_dukkha_** = 28 ways
1. through the phenomenon of **_asubha_** = 9 ways 4. through the phenomenon of **_anatta_** = 9 ways totally in (60) ways. It is explained by using the word, **_ādi_** = et cetera (etc), in order to be able to discern through more than (60) ways. In other words, due to explanation of (14) varieties for phenomenon of **_anicca_**, (28) varieties for phenomenon of **_dukkha_**, (9) varieties for phenomenon of **_asubha_**, (9) varieties for phenomenon of **_anatta_**, the **_meditatior_** has to perform in order to see each phenomenon and discerning must be carried out through four general characters of, **_anicca, dukkha, asuhba, anatta_** alternatively.

This is the advantage that\_\_\_\_ it can be said that this **_meditatior_** who discerns through these ways has fulfilled to deep in mind conditioned things through generalizing as three characters. The reason why these conditioned things are worth keeping in mind by this way is that\_\_\_ for the purpose not to follow conditioned things again and in order to fulfill expediency of deliverance from conditioned thing, which is called **_muccana_**. **_(Vs-2-290)_**

**Worldly simile \_\_\_\_** When the fisher man's son submerges about ten metres depth and catches a poisonous sea snake with three stripes, he thinks it as a fish and emerges happily on surface of water. As soon as he sees poisonous snakes with three stripes he twirls that snake and then he throws it away suddenly. Similarly \_\_\_\_ when the **_meditatior_** with **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge discerns conditioned things, he sees well three general characters, impermanence, suffering, non-self, as poisonous snake with three stripes. Then he reasons all conditioned things occurring in three realms with the result that all conditioned things appear as very dangerous ones with impermanence, suffering, non-self. He is very afraid of the occurrence of existing in three realms as the feather shrinks when it is toasted by placing close to a fire. **_(Verse of Translation of Visuddhi Magga-5-242, by the most Venerable Ashin Maha Silavamsa)_**

In the continuum of that **_meditatior_**, the knowledge of Reflection **_(paṭisaṅkhāra ñāṇa)_** appears by reasoning which occurs through keeping in mind on various phenomena of conditioned things, **_anicca_** etc.

**6.7 Preaching found in Pāli Text of _Paṭisambhidā Magga_**
\*\*\*

##### ` `**_Pāli Quotation (Paṭisam-259)_**

1. For the **_meditatior_** who takes into heart on conditioned thing as '**_anicca_**', the knowledge "appears" after 'knowing' by means of characters of '**_anicca_**' in a way that... "it is impermanence but a short instant only".
1. For the **_meditatior_** who takes into heart on conditioned thing as '**_dukkha_**', the knowledge "appears" after 'knowing' by means of characters of suffering of **_pavatta dhamma_** (continuous occurring cyclic **_dhammas_** called corporeality, feeling, perception, **_kamma_**-formation, consciousness).
1. For the **_meditatior_** who takes into heart on conditioned thing as '**_anatta_**', the knowledge "appears" after 'knowing' by means of characters of non-self of both **_nimitta_** (sign) and **_pavatta. (Paṭisam-259)_**

In those words of Pāli Text, it explained as two kinds of verbs knowing and appears, have different moments through previous and later one, that\_\_\_\_ "after knowing by means of **_anicca, dukkha, anatta_**", afterwards, it said "the knowledge appears. In this case, however there is no difference in time as previous and later one.

#### **PAGE-348**

It explained as different time through grammatical aspect though there is no difference in time. Actually the process of knowing and the occurrence of knowledge are synchronous events **_(samānakāla)_**. As two kinds of verbs, depending upon **_(paṭicca)_** and arises **_(uppajjati)_** are synchronous events in the words \_\_\_\_ **_"manañca paticca dhamme ca uppajjati manoviññāṇam._** Depending upon both mind-door life-continuum and ideational objects **_(dhammārammaṇa)_**, the mind-door-consciousness arises" \_\_\_\_ similarly \_\_\_\_ it should be recognized the fact that \_\_\_\_ in this case, two kinds of verbs, 'knowing' and 'appears', are synchronous events. **_(Vs-2-291, Mahāṭī-2-454)_**

In the next method \_\_\_\_ among continuous occurring knowledge, respective known on **_nimitta_** and **_pavatta_** through three general character, called the verb, **_paṭisaṅkhāra_**, should be referred by means of previous occurring knowledge. Then the verb, 'appears', should be referred by means of succeeding knowledge. Those two kinds, however, should not be reasoned as different ones. This is because \_\_\_\_ it should be recognized as a single knowledge by **_ekatta naya_**, due to falling into single continuum of mentality for those kinds of knowledge.**_(Vs-2-291, Mahāṭī-2-455)_**

In this stage of knowledge of Reflection, **_vipassanā_** practice should be performed by taking object of phenomena of perishing away of conditioned things belonging to those groups, from corporeal aggregate to aging-death. Discerning **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge should be discerned by succeeding **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge again.

#### **7.1 _Dvikotikā suññatānupassanā_**

After discerning by the knowledge of Reflection on conditioned things in a way that **_sabbe saṅkhārā suñña_** = all kinds of conditioned things are void of 'self', then the nature of nothingness with two situations **_(dvikotika suññata)_** is kept in mind by reason **_(pañña)_**... that ... "**_suññamidam attena vā attaniyena vā_** = all these conditioned things are void of both "self" and "prosperity" related with self. **_(Vs-2-291)_**

Although the knowledge of Reflection occurs through keeping in mind on the phenomena of **_anicca, dukkha, anatta_** of conditioned things, especially \_\_\_\_ keeping in mind on the phenomenon of **_anatta_** plays significant role in the occurrence of knowledge of Reflection. The commentator Sayadaw, therefore, explained with above phrase, "**_sabbe saṅkhārā suññati pariggahetvā_** = after discerning by the knowledge of Reflection on conditioned things in a way that all kinds of conditioned things are void of self" etc., as beginning.

It is right. \_\_\_\_ Only when the phenomenon of non-self of those conditioned things are kept in mind by knowledge, the penetrative knowing and seeing on Four Noble Truths called **_sacca paṭivedha_** can be accomplished well. Unless it is kept in mind, it can not be accomplished. It is right. \_\_\_\_ Due to inability to keep in mind on that phenomenon of **_anatta_**, the admonished of hermits, **_Sarabhanga_** etc., which can preach on two kinds of phenomena only, **_anicca_** and **_dukkha_** through terminological usage of those phenomena but not **_anicca_**, is designates as **_aniyyānika sāsanā_** by which deliverance from rounds of rebirth can not be accomplished, really. **_(Mahāṭī-2-455)_**

In the next method \_\_\_\_ With referring to the occurrence of void of essence of **_anicca_**, essence of **_sukkha_**, essence of **_atta_**, of those conditioned things, the commentator Sayadaw explained by those words,... "after discerning by the knowledge of Reflection on conditioned things in away that all kinds of conditioned things are void of self". It is right. Such conditioned thing lacks in such essence of **_nicca_** etc. It should be recognized, "that conditioned thing is void of that essence of **_nicca_** etc.,".

Due to difficulty to know on the occurrence of void of self of conditioned things, the commentator Sayadaw continued to explain again, that "**_dvikotikā suññatā nupassanā_**" through a way that "**_suññamidam attena vā attaniyena vā_** = all these conditioned things are void of both 'self' and "property related with self.." etc., in order to reach stability of **_suññata nupassanā_**, although it has been known frequently. In those

#### **PAGE-350**

\*\*

words, conditioned things are absent in 'self', those are not 'self' for such situation; it is not the property of self for that situation. It is right. \_\_\_\_ Only when the 'self' is present, the property of self should be occurred. (Due to lack of self, property of self is also absent). Therefore, the commentator Sayadaw explained that "**_suññamidam attena vā attaniyena vā_** = all these conditioned things are void of both "self" and "property related with self".

The reason why both two kinds, **_atta, attaniya_**, are void in conditioned things is that\_\_\_\_ although the **_meditator_** scrutinizes with the help of experiential knowledge **_(paccakkha ñāṇa)_** and hypothetical knowledge **_(anumāna ñāṇa)_**, both two kinds of **_atta attaniya_** can not be found in those conditioned things. It means that although scrutinizing by two kinds of experiential and hypothetical knowledge are performed, either a kind of being or a kind of conditioned thing, which depends on the occurrence of occurrence of property of self, which depends on the occurrence of capable of finishing of happiness-suffering by 'self', can not be seen. **_(Mahāṭī-2-455)_**

This way of discerning, "all these conditioned things are void of both 'self' and "property related with self" is called "**_dvikotikā suññatā nupassanā_**".

**7.2 _Catukotikā suññatānupassanā_**

##### ` `**_Pāli Quotation (Vs-2-291)_**

This way of discerning, **_catukotika suññatānupassanā_**, can be found in **_Āneñjasappāya Sutta, Upari paṇṇāsa, page 50_**, and the meaning is explained in **_Visuddhi Magga_**, as follows.\_\_\_\_

##### ` `**_Pāli Quotation (Vs-2-292)_** **_(Mahāṭī-2-456)_**

According to exegeses found in above commentary and sub commentary, the **_meditator_** has to discern on these four kinds of nature, viz, 1. the nature of absence of 'self' in internal five aggregates,

2. the nature of absence of property related with self in internal five aggregates,
3. the nature of absence of 'self' in external five aggregates,
4. the nature of absence of property related with self in external five aggregates, by the help of **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge.

If the absence of **_atta-attaniya_** in four circumstances can be seen by **_Vipassanā_** Knowledge, it can be said **_catukoṭika suññatānupassanā_** has been accomplished.
