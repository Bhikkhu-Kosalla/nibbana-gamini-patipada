**Stage of anuloma*ñāṇa* (Knowledge of Adaptation)** 

***Saccānulomika ñāṇa*** (Knowledge of Adaptation to the Truth). 

Those respectable qualities, i.e, nobility of the Buddha, nobility of ***Dhamma***, nobility of ***Sangha***, nobility of virtue, nobility of concentration, nobility of wisdom, etc., are bases of clear mind which are fundamental causes of apparent occurrence of clear (***pasāda***) ***dhamma*** really. A kind of firm faith which occurs after determining that 'it is real Buddha', 'it is real ***Dhamma***', 'it is real ***Sangh***ā', the noble eightfold path called ***sāsanabrahma*** cariya (=pure practice under admonishment), consisting of three noble training, to wit, training of virtue, training of concentration, training of wisdom, is  real  ***Dhamma***  of  the  cause  of  deliverance  of  suffering  of  rounds  of  rebirth (***samsāra***)..,  'the  noble  doctrine  of  causal  relationship  called  ***paṭiccasamuppada*** (dependent origination) is, without any exception, certainly true and finally proved by the Buddha', etc.. is called ***adhimokkha saddhā*** (= fixedly firm faith). 

1. For that ***meditator*** who respectfully and continuously develops ***saṅkhārupekkhā*** ***ñāṇa*** (knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations), as a fire is kindled by using tinderbox, the fixedly firm faith (***adhimokkha saddh***ā) would be appeared strongly due to presence of extreme efficacy of significant function of knowledge of neutrality. 
1. The effort (***viriya***), which is capable of supporting for associating ***dhammas*** not to be slack in respective function of ***vipassanā*** practice, which is capable of removing opposite ***dhammas***, would be appeared efficaciously and persistently. 
1. Due to presence of extreme efficacious occurrence, the mindfulness (***sati***) which is capable of taking well the object of ***saṅkhāra dhamma*** as a result of direct facing with it, would be appeared. 
1. Due  to  presence  of  strong  tranquillity  (***passaddhi***)  and  bliss  (***sukha***),  the concentration  (***samādhi***)  which  is  capable  of  putting  harmoniously  mind  on object of ***saṅkhāra dhamma***, would be appeared. 
1. The wisdom of Neutrality Towards Formations (***saṅkhārupekkhā*** ***pañña***) which is middle and neutral occurrence in having reasoned inductively from specific nature  of  things  to  general  i.e.,  impermanence,  (***anicca***),  suffering  (***dukkha***), non-self (***anatta***), which is extreme efficacious knowledge as a cause to occur Knowledge of Adaptation (***anuloma ñāṇa***), would be appeared. 

Because  of  completion  with  matureness  of  five  controlling  faculties  in  that way, in the continuum of practising ***meditator*** with Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations at the appropriate time when it is deserving to say, "now the noble Path- ***dhamma*** will arise certainly", the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations takes 

place **PAGE-434** 

discerning  and  inductive  reasoning  on  ***saṅkhāra  dhammas***  as  any  kind  of  three general characters, impermanence, suffering or non-self for seven times of ***Vipassanā*** impulsions and passes away. Afterward it falls into the life-continuum. Just after life- continuum  a  mind-door  adverting  consciousness  arises  contiguously  that  sees 

***saṅkhāara dhammas***  any kind of three general characters, impermanence, suffering or  non-self,  depending  on  how  the  Knowledge  of  Neutrality  Towards  Formations arose. Just after mind-door adverting consciousness, without having no opportunity to arise  but  to  fall  back  for  the  life-continuum,  a  consciousness  of  first  impulsion (***javana***) called preliminary work (***parikamma***), which sees ***saṅkhāra dhammas*** in the same way, arises contiguously and it maintains the continuity of consciousness. It is designated as preliminary work (***parikamma***) because it is able to accommodate for arising of the Noble Path. 

Just after that impulsion called preliminary work, a consciousness of second impulsion which also takes the object of ***saṅkhāra dhammas*** in the same way, arises contiguously. That consciousness of second impulsion is called the 'access' (***upacāra***) due to its occurrence near to the Noble Path. 

Just  after  that  consciousness  of  second  impulsion  called  'access',  a consciousness of third impulsion which also sees ***saṅkhāra dhammas*** in the same way,  arises  contiguously.  It  is  designated  as  "adaptation"  (***anuloma***)  because  it  is adaptable to both real functions of eight kinds of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge that came before  and  real  functions  of  the  thirty-seven  factors  of  enlightenment  of  the  Path Consciousness that will come after. These three kinds of designations, preliminary work, access and adaptation, are specific terms of those three kinds of impulsions indeed. 

For all kinds of impulsion, however, it can be designated generally and then it will be appropriate to designate those three kinds of consciousness of impulsions as both  

1. 'habitual recurrence' (***āsevana***), due to occurrence of ability to develop respectfully and frequently,  
1. 'preliminary work' (***parikamma***), due to presence of accommodation to arise the Noble Path,  
1. 'access' (***upacāra***), due to it occurrence near to the Noble Path, and  
1. 'adaptation' (***anuloma***), due to occurrence of adaptability to both previous and later ***dhammas***, appropriately. 

**PAGE-435** 

**Adaptation  (*anuloma*)**\_\_\_\_\_  Which  ***dhammas***  are  to  be  adaptable?  It  is adaptable to both those ***dhammas*** that came before and those ***dhammas*** that will come after. It is right. \_\_\_ That third impulsion called 'adaptation' (***anuloma***) is pertinent with both real functions of eight kinds of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge that come before, i.e, from the Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away to the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations, and real functions of the thirty-seven kinds of associating factors of enlightenment (***bodhipakkhiya dhammas***) within one mind moment of the Noble Path that will come after. (***Vs-2-308***). 

Because the Knowledge of Adaptation (***anuloma ñāṇa***) is capable of removing extra ordinarily bulks of delusion etc., that are concealing on the Four Noble Truths, it reaches at the end of extra-ordinary condition (***ukkamsa pariyantagata***) among all kinds of mundane ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge. The Knowledge of Adaptation, therefore, arises by finishing its function that is very far from opposite nature of functions of previous kinds of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away etc.,  resulting  in  adaptability  to  those  functions  of  previous  ones,  Knowledge  of Arising and Passing Away etc ,. The commentary, therefore, explained "that third impulsion called 'adaptation' (***anuloma***) is pertinent with both real functions of eight kinds of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge that came before, i.e, the Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away etc., and real functions of thirty-seven kinds of associating factors of enlightenment  within  one  mind  moment  of  the  Noble  Path  that  will  come  after. (***Mahāṭī-2-480***). 

More explicitness are as follows: -  

Due to occurrence of that Knowledge of Adaptation by means of taking the object of any kind of general charactors, impermanence etc., of ***saṅkhāra dhammas*** (conditioned  things)  occurring  in  three  realms,  \_\_\_\_it  is  pertinent  with  the  real functions of both….. 

1. "the Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away (***udayabbaya ñāṇa***) that is capable of  knowing  on  processes  of  arising  and  passing  away  of  ***saṅkhāra  dhammas*** which have the nature of arising and passing away only, has seen those processes of arising and passing away really'. 
1. " the Knowledge of Dissolution (***bhanga ñāṇa***) that is capable of discerning on dissolution of ***saṅkhāra dhammas*** which have the nature of dissolution moment (***bhangakkha***ṇ***a***) only, has seen those process of dissolution really"., 
1. "the Knowledge of Terror (***bhayatupaṭṭhana ñāṇa***) that is capable of discerning on  terror  of  ***saṅkhāra  dhammas***  which  have  the  nature  of  terror  only,  has discerned as the nature of terror really"., 
1. "the  Knowledge  of  Danger  (***adīnavā***  ***nupassanā***  ***ñāṇa***)  that  is  capable  of discerning  on  danger  of  ***saṅkhāra  dhammas***  which  have  only  dangers  of impermanence,  suffering,  change  and  alteration  (***vipariñāṇa***),  has  seen  those dangers really", 
1. "the  Knowledge  of  Disenchantment  (***nibbidā***  ***ñāṇa***)  that  is  capable  of discenchanting  from  ***saṅkhāra  dhamma***  which  should  be  disenchanted,  has disenchanted really", 
1. "the  Knowledge  of  Desire  for  Deliverance  (***muñcitukamyatā***  ***ñāṇa***)  that  is desirous for deliverance from ***saṅkhāra dhammas*** which should be delivered, has occurred with desire for deliverance really", 
1. "the Knowledge of Reflection that is capable of reflecting on ***saṅkhāra dhammas*** which should be reflected by discerning so as to see three general characters, has performed really", and 

**PAGE-436** 

8. "the Knowledge of Neurtrality Towards Formations (***saṅkhārupekkhā*** ***ñāṇa***) that is capable of neutralizing on ***saṅkhāra dhammas*** which should be neutralized, has neutralize  really".,  as  it  says  in  this  way,  as  shown  in  the  method  called "***atthāpattinaya***" in which the same meaning falls though nothing is said so far forth. 

Furthermore  it  is  also  adaptable  to  the  real  functions  of  thirty-seven  kinds  of associating factors of enlightenment at the one mind moment of the Noble Path that will come after. (That function, indeed, is removing opposite ***dhammas***, carelessness on the Four Noble Truths, etc). It is because \_\_\_\_ that Knowledge of Adaptation can be  reached  by  means  of  the  way  of  practice  that  removes  very  thick  impurity (***samkilesa***)  which  is  capable  of  concealing  on  the  Four  Noble  Truths.  It  is right\_\_\_\_\_\_ Unless the Knowledge of Adaptation occurs in that way,  the Knowledge of Trans-lineage (***gotrabhu ñāṇa***) is incapable of taking the object of ***nibbāna***. It should be understood unless the Knowledge of Trans-lineage arises the Noble Path Knowledge is unable to arise by taking the object of ***nibbāna***, consequently. Thus, due to adaptability to eight kinds of lower ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge primarily and due to adaptability to thirty-seven kinds of associating factors of enlightenment which will occur within one mind moment of the Noble Path, resulting in adaptability to the Noble Truth of the Course Leading to ***nibbāna*** (ariya magga sacca), this Knowledge of Adaptation is also known as ***saccānulomika ñāṇa*** ( Knowledge of Adaptation to the Truth).

8.2  **Synonyms of *Vipassanā*** **Knowledge Leading to Emerging (*vuṭṭhānagamini vipassanā*** ***ñāṇa*)** 

***Palī*** ***Quotation (Mahāṭī-2- 481) (Vs -2-309)***. 

Only  this  Knowledge  of  Adaptation  is  the  end  of  field  of  ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge with the object of ***saṅkhāra dhamma***, which approaches to the Noble Path. Actually, the Knowledge of Trans-lineage (***gotrabhuñāṇa***), among all kinds of Knowledge, is the end of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to emerging. 

***(Vs-2-309)***. 

Due to emerging from both phenomenon (***nimitta***) and the circle of existence (***pavaṭṭa***), the Noble Path is designated as 'emergence" (***vuṭṭhana***) . That Knowledge of  Trans-lineage  deserves  to  say  as  the  Knowledge  Leading  to  Emerging (***vuṭṭhānagamini***) ecause it is able to go and approach to the  Noble Path. Therefore the end of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging, which takes the object of conditioned things (***saṅkhata dhammas***), is the Knowledge of Adaptation (***anuloma ñāṇa***).  The  end  of  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to  Emerging,  which  takes  the object  of  ***nibbāna***  is  the  Knowledge  of  Trans-Lineage.  In  accordance  with  the commentary  called  ***Visuddhi  Magga***,  therefore,  it  should  be  recognized  that  the Knowledge  of  Trans-Lineage  also  belongs  to  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to Emerging (***vuṭṭhana gamini vipassanā***). 

Various kinds of synonyms of the ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging were  preached  indirectly  in  various  discourses  (***suttanta***).  Now  it  should  be recognized  the  explanation  on  the  following  quoted  discourses  with  synonyms  of those ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge not to ge confused and misunderstood.  

1. ***atammayata* (the opposite of craving) (*M-3-263*).**  

In  ***Salāyatanavibhanga  Sutta***,  this  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to Emerging was preached as ***atammayata*** (***vipassanā*** that is opposite of craving) in such way that "*bhikkhus* after developing ***Vipassanā*** Practice leading to emerging which is the opposite of craving and depending upon that ***vipassanā*** practice, the neutrality feeling  consisting  in  such  mind  moments  of  immaterial  sphere  and  the  neutrality produced by ***vipassanā*** (***vipassanupekkh***ā) which is the ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge taking the object of those mental ***dhammas*** of immaterial sphere are designated as "unity" (***ekatta***) due to presence of the same nature and object. Those kinds of neutrality are designated as "universal depending on" (***ekattasita***) because they are depending upon objects with the same nature. Try to abandon those defilements taking objects of those kinds of neutrality...! Develop well to overcome that neutrality..! (***Vs-2-309, 310***). **PAGE-438** 

***atammayata***\_\_\_\_ By taking the object of mundane ***saṅkhāra dhammas*** which are  objects  of  such  ***vipassanā***  practice,  the  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to Emerging  with  the  Knowledge  of  Adaptation  as  end  of  its,  arises  consequently. Because the craving (***ta***ṇ***ha***), which occurs depending upon and relating to ***saṅkhāra dhammas***  that  are  object  of  that  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge,  which  craves  ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas*** that are objects of that ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, is unable to occur in the absence of those ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas*** that are objects of that ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, it is designated as ***tammay***ā. The ***tammayā*** is also called ***tammayat***ā. 

In  other  words  \_\_\_\_\_\_  Those  mental  aggregates  rooted  in  hate,  which  are associating  with  craving,  are  called  ***tammay***ā.  The  causal  nature  of  those  mental aggregates rooted in hate is called ***tammayat***ā. Actually the causal nature of those mental aggregates rooted in hate is that craving. ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging, which is opposite of that craving and it can remove the latter, is called a- ***tammayat***ā. In the commentary of ***Majjhima Nikāya***, it , therefore, is explained as follows.  

(***M-A-4-189***). 

- ***'tammayat***ā'  is  the  name  of  the  craving.  Due  to  ability  to  exhaust  that 

craving, ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging is designated as a-***tammayat***ā.  ***(M-A-4-189) (Mahāṭī-2-481)***. 

***ekatta, ekattasita*** \_\_\_\_ Neutrality feelings, which occur by taking objects of five senses, to wit, colour  - object, sound - object, odour- object, flavour  - object, tactile -object, are of various kinds. (It means that those neutrality feelings can be associated  with  various  consciousness,  five-door  advertence,  seeing-consciousness, receiving,  investigating,  determining,  impulsions,  registering  etc,  accordingly. Therefore it is ***nānatta*** (variety). Due to presence of five kinds of objects it depends on and takes varieties of objects. Therefore it is ***nānattasita*** ( = various depending on). ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, especially the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations, which is discerning on those kinds of neutrality which are varieties (***ñāṇa***tta), various depending  on  (***ñāṇa***ttasita),  is  called  the  neutrality  produced  by  ***vipassanā*** (***vipassanupekkh***ā). It should be recognized in this way. 

Neutrality feeling consisting in mind and mental concomitants of immaterial sphere, i.e, consciousness of absorption of boundless space (***akāsānañcāyatana jhāna viññāṇa***),  consciousness  of  absorption  of  boundless  consciousness (***viññāṇancāyatana  jhāna  viññāṇa***),  consciousness  of  absorption  of  emptiness (***akiñcaññāyatana  jhāna  viññāṇa***),  consciousness  of  absorption  of  neither  - perception - nor - non - perception (***nevasañña - nā*** ***- saññāyatana jhāna viññāṇa***) are called 'unity' (***ekatta***) due to presence of the same nature and object. Those kinds of neutrality feeling are called "universal depending on (***ekattasita***) because they are depending upon objects with the same nature. The neutrality produced by ***vipassanā***, which is discerning on absorptions of immaterial sphere with neutrality feeling that is ***ekatta*** and ***ekattasita***, is also called ***ekatta*** and ***ekattasita***. It means that the craving on ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas*** called ***ekatta*** and ***ekattasita***, must be abandoned by discerning ***vipassanā***  practice.  "The  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to  Emerging,  which  is capable of abandoning and exhausting that craving, is called ***a-tammayata***", preached by the Buddha.  

**PAGE-439** 

2. ***nibbida* (disenchantment)** 

***nibbindan virajjati, virāgā*** ***vimuccati***. (***M-1-192***). 

- Due to presence of disenchantment it is free oneself of passion resulting in 

deliverance from defilements. ( ***M-1-192***). 

In this ***Alagadda Sutta***, this ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging was preached as ***nibbidā*** (disenchantment). In that Sutta, it should be recognized the fact that it was preached on  

1. the  word,  "***nibbindam***"  ,  so  as  to  refer  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to Emerging, 
2. the word, "***virajjati***", so as to refer the function of Noble Path, 
3. the word, "***vimuccati***", (= deliverance from defilements), so as to refer the function of fruition (***phalakicca***). (***Mahāṭī-2-481***).   

\3.   ***dhammaṭṭhitiñāṇa***  

***pubble kho Susima dhammaṭṭhitiñāṇam,***  

***pacchā*** ***nibbāne ñāṇam. (Sam-1-344)*** 

- Susima  .....  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  called  "***dhammaṭṭhiti***"  which  is  well 

situated on phenomena of impermenence, suffering non-self of ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhamma*** is previously, the Noble Path-Knowledge which takes the object of ***nibbāna*** is later.  (***Sam-1-344***).  

Thus, in this ***Susima Sutta***, this ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging is preached  as  "***dhammatthitiñāṇa***".  It  is  because  \_\_\_\_  this  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge Leading  to  Emerging  arises  by  means  of  non-bewildering  on  the  Doctrine  of Dependent Origination called ***dhammaṭṭhiti***, indeed.  

(***Vs-2-310; Mahāṭī-2-482***). 

***Palī*** ***Quotation (Sam-A-2-63, Second Ñāṇavatthu Sutta)*** 

Every  resultant  ***dhamma***  is  related  to  respective  causal  ***dhamma*** as  natural fixed law. Due to presence of related occurrence in that way, the causal ***dhamma*** which  is  the  condition  of  resultant  ***dhamma***  (  =   corporeality  and  mentality  )  is designated as "thiti". The causal ***dhamma*** (ṭ***hiti***) which is the condition of resultant ***dhamma***  belonging  to  three-time-phases,  ***uppāda***-ṭ***hiti***-***bhanga***,  is  called ***dhammaṭṭihiti***. In other words \_\_\_\_ The term, ***dhamma***, means causal ***dhamma***. Such nature of situation (= condition) of that causal ***dhamma*** is present. That nature of situation (= condition) is called ***dhammaṭṭhit*** due to lack of any other things. It means the situated causal ***dhamma***. The Knowledge that knows causal ***dhamma*** on which resultant ***dhamma*** depends, in other words, the Knowledge that knows the situated causal ***dhamma*** is called ***dhammatṭhitiñāṇa***. Therefore, the commentary explained on ***dhammaṭṭhiñāṇa***  as  the  Knowledge  that  knows  causal  relationship  called ***paccayākāra***. 

**PAGE-440** 

It  is  right  \_\_\_\_\_  That  Doctrine  of  Dependence  -  Origination  called '***paccayākāra***' should be designated as '***dhammaṭṭhiti***' because it is the causal ***dhamma*** of ṭ***hiti*** (situation) called ***pavatti*** which is continuous occurrence of resultant ***dhammas*** without  interruption  by  means  of  three-time-phases,  ***uppada,***  ṭ***hiti,  bhanga***.  The Knowledge that knows this ***dhammaṭṭhiti*** is called  ***dhammaṭṭhiti*** ***ñāṇa***. Therefore, 

* ***paccaya pariggahe paññā*** ***dhammaṭṭhiti ñāṇam. (Patisam-1)***. 
- The wisdom that is arising by discerning on Cause and Condition is called 

***dhammaṭṭhiti*** ***ñāṇa (Patisam-1)*** 

Thus  Veneravble  Sariputta  preached  in  ***Patisambhida  Magga***.  This  term, ***dhammaṭṭhiti ñāṇa*** is the name of (6) kinds of Knowledge for the ignorance (***avijja***), i.e,  

1. Knowledge that knows, “due to occurrence of ignorance, ***kamma***-formations arise in present,” 
1. Knowledge  that  knows,  “due  to  cessation  of  ignorance,  ***kamma***-formations cease in present,” 

These  two  kinds  of  knowledge  on  two  kinds  of  processes,  ‘arising’  and ‘ceasing’, can occur for past and future similarly, resulting in (6) kinds of knowledge for the ignorance. Similarly, for ‘‘***saṅkhāra*** ***paccayā*** ***vinñāṇam*** etc, it is the name of (6)  kinds  of  knowledge  respectively.  It  can  be  found  (6)  varieties  of  knowledge respectively.  It  can  be  found  (6)  varieties  of  knowledge  on  the  Doctrine  of Dependence - Origination belonging to three periods, past, present, future by means of two processes, ‘arising’ and ‘ceasing’. 

Because this ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge is capable of discerning on those (6) kinds of  knowledge  again,  it  arises  by  means  of  non  -  bewildering  on  the  Doctrine  of Dependent Origination called ***dhammaṭṭhiti***. This ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging, therefore, is designated as ***dhammaṭṭhitiñāṇa***. (***Mahāṭī-2-482***) 

***(Sam-A-2-117) (Sam-tī-2-124)*** 

According  to  these  explanations,  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  that  knows  natural phenomena of the ultimate ***dhammas***, i.e, impermanence, suffering , non-self is called ***dhammaṭṭhitiñāṇa***. All kinds of causal and result and corporeality - mentality belong to the ultimate ***dhammas*** which are situated in natural phenomena of impermanence, suffering, non-self. 

**PAGE-441** 

Among those ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge that are knowing on those natural phenomena of causal  and  resultant  corporeality-mentality,  this  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  leading  to Emerging is the peak of all. Therefore the Buddha preached ***Susima*** that ***Vipassanā***  knowledge leading to emerging which is known as ***dhamaṭṭhitiñāṇa*** arises previously and then the Noble Path-Knowledge which takes the object of ***nibbāna***, arises later.  (It  means  the  Noble  Path  Knowledge  which  takes  the  object  of  ***nibbāna***  is  the consequence of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge but not that of Super Pshychic - Knowledge (***abhiññāṇa***). 

4. **saññagga** 
* ***sañña kho poṭṭhapāda paṭhamam uppajjati, pacchā*** ***ñāṇam. (D-1-172) Poṭṭhapada***..... the perception (***sañña***), actually, arises previously, the Noble 

Path-Knowledge arises later. (***D-1-172***). 

Thus, in ***Poṭṭhapada*** ***Sutta*** this ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging is preached as ***saññagga*** ( = perception). (***Vs-2-310***). 

In the original Palī Text, as quoted above, the phrase "***sañña kho poṭṭhapāda***" etc.,  only  the  "perception"  is  preached.  However  the  commentary  explained  on “***saññagga***”  because  those  words,  "***saññaggam  phusati***",  (=  it  is  reached  to  the "perception" associating with supreme ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging) is preached in the beginning of that sutta. (***Mah***āṭī-2-482). 

5. ***pārisuddhipadhāniyanga*** 
* ***paṭipadañāṇa dassanavisuddhi pārisuddhipadhāniyangam. (D-3-252)***.  
- Purification  of  the  Course  Leading  to  the  Path-Knowledge  is  significant 

factor of circumstantial purification lacking any impurity of defilements. (***D-3-252***). 

Thus in Dasuttara Sutta, this ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging is preached as significant factor of circumstantial purification lacking any impurity of defilements (***pārisuddhi padhāniyanga***). ***(Vs-2-310)***. 

***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging is a part of Purification of the Course Leading to the Path - Knowledge. All kinds of Knowledge from the matured Knowledge  of  Arising  and  Passing  Away,  which  is  free  from  impurities  of defilements,  to  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to  Emerging,  belong  to ***Paṭipadāñāṇadassana*** ***Visuddhi***. It is a metaphorical usage called ***ekadesayupacāra***, by  which  it  explained  on  the  partial  factor,  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to Emerging, as the significant factor of circumstantial purification lacking any impurity of defilements, instead of th total  factor, ***Paṭipadāñāṇadassana Visuddhi***. (***Mahāṭī-2- 482***). 

6. ***muñcitukamyatā*** ***ñāṇa, paṭtisaṅkhānuppasnā*** ***ñāṇa, saṅkhārupekkhā*** ***ñāṇa***  (***Paṭisam - 259***) 

**PAGE-442** 

- There  are  three  kinds  of  designations,  to  wit,  Knowledge  of  Desire  for 

Deliverance  (***muñcitukamyatāñāṇa***),  Knowledge  of  Reflection  (***paṭisaṅkhāñāṇa***), 

Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations (***saṅkhārupekkhāñāṇa***), which have the same meaning but terminology only. (***Paṭisam - 259***). 

Thus  in  the  Pali  Text  of  ***Paṭisambhidā***  ***Magga***,  this  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge Leading to Emerging is preached as three kinds of synonyms, ***muñcitukamyatāñāṇa***, ***paṭisaṅkhānuppasnā*** ***ñāṇa***, ***saṅkhārupekkhā***  ñāṇa . (***Vs - 2- 310***). 

According to these Pali Text and commentary, those three kinds of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge can be designated as ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging. 

7. ***anuloma, gotrabhu, vodāna (Paṭṭhāna-1-138)*.** 
- These  mind  moments  benefit  by  means  of  efficiency  of  Condition  of 

Contiguity  (***anantara  paccaya***),  'Adaptation  (***anuloma***)  '  to  'Trans-lineage (***gotrabhu***)', 'Adaptation' to 'Purity (***vodana***)', 'Trans-lineage' to '***sotāpattimagga***' (= the path Knowledge of Upstream enterer), 'Purity' to ***sakadāgāmimagga*** (= the Path- Knowledge  of  Once-returnee),  ***anāgāmimagga***  (=  the  Path-Knowledge  of  Non- returnee),  ***arahatta  magga***  (=  the  Path  -  Knowledge  of  Arahant),  respectively. (***Paṭṭhāna-1-138***).  

Thus,  in  Pali  Text  of  ***Paṭṭhāna***,  this  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to Emerging  is  preached  as  three  kinds  of  designations,  to  wit,  ***anuloma,  gotrabhu, vodāna***. (***Vs-2-310***).  

8. ***paṭipadāñāṇa dassana visuddhi (M-1-201)***  
- How are you. Do you practise ***brahmacariya*** (= both theoretical and practical 

study of the Dhamma) under the admonishment of the Buddha for the purpose to attain ***paṭipadāñāṇadassana visuddhi***? (***M-1-201***). 

Thus in ***Rathavinīta Sutta***, this ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging is preached as ***paṭipadāñāṇadassana*** ***visuddhi*** (= Purification of the Course Leading to the Path-Knowledge). (***Vs-2-310***). 

The practice up to ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging to the Path- Knowledge) including three Noble Training, to wit, Training of Virtue, Training of Concentration,  Training  of  Wisdom,  is  designated  as  ***sāsana  brahmacariya***.  The Noble Path-Knowledge is designated as ***maggabrahmacariya***, indeed. In this case it refers  to  the  first  one,  ***sāsanabrahmacariya***  especially.  However  if  the  stage  of Purification  of  the  Course  Leading  to  the  Path-Knowledge  ,  called  ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge  Leading  to  Emerging  is  reached,  the  Noble  Path-Knowledge  called ***ñāṇadassanavisuddhi*** (= Purification of the Path-Knowledge) will  arise certainly. Therefore  it  should  be  recognized  the  fact  that  in  above  ***Rathavinita  Sutta, maggabrahmacariya*** is also not rejected totally though it refers ***sāsanabrahmacariya*** especially.  However  ***maggabrahmacariya***  will  be  continued  to  explain  under  the heading of ***ñāṇadassana*** ***visuddhi*** (= Purification of the Path-Knowledge ) in later. 

**PAAGE-443 8.3. Determination on Way of Emerging from *nimitta* and *pavatta*.** 

Way  of  emerging  from  ***nimitta***  and  ***pavatta***  has  been  presented  in  brief previously. Here the explanation of commentary of ***Atthasalinī*** (***Abhi-A-1-275-279***) will be presented in detail. As mentioned above, when the Noble Path associating with various numbers of factors of enlightenment (***bojjhanga***), factors of path (***magganga***) factors  of  absorption  (***jhānanga***),  arises  there  are  reasonable  questions  that  "from which  'Trans-lineage'  (***gotrabhu***)  emerge?  .."  and   "from  which  the  Noble  Path emerge? " . Answers are as follows: -  

Previously  'Trans-lineage'  emerges  from  ***nimitta***  called  the  object  of phenomenon of ***saṅkhāradhammas***. However it is unable to cut out pavatta called "cyclic ***dhammas*** which are occurring continuously". It is right \_\_\_\_\_ This 'Trans- lineage' is a ***dhamma*** which can emerge from one side only (***ekato vuṭṭhāna***). The Noble Path, however, not only emerges from ***nimitta*** called the object of phenomena of ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas*** but also can cut out ***pavatta*** called " cyclic ***dhammas*** which are occurring continuously". It is right. \_\_\_ This Noble Path is a ***dhamma*** which can emerge from both sides called ***nimitta, pavatta (ubhato vuṭṭhānā)***.  

The following is the way of reasoning how those 'Trans-lineage' and Noble Path arise consecutively. Detailed account is as follows. 

On such occasion during ***vipassanā*** practice, the 'Emerging (***vuṭṭhāna***)' called the Noble  Path arises. On that occasion 'Adaptation' (***anuloma***) does not occur only once nor five times. It is because \_\_\_\_a single 'Adaptation' can not attain supporting factor of Condition of Habitual Recurrence (***āsevana paccaya***) while the fifth one is shaken  because  it  is  adjacent  to  life-continuum  and  is  unstable  to  support  'Trans- lineage'. It is right\_\_\_\_ By the time the fifth one arises, any kind of impulsion falls in strength. The 'Adaptation', therefore, does not arise only once nor five times.  (***Abhi-A-1-275***). 

The word, “***pavedhati*** = be shaken”, means it is unable to occur as the cause of 'Trans-lineage'. If any impulsion falls in strength at fifth mind moment, there will be a reasonable question that "why those 'Trans-lineage' and successive 'Noble Path' arise at the time the impulsion falls in strength?". The answer is that newly occurrence of any impulsion never has decrease in strength really. It is right. \_\_\_\_ If those previous impulsions arise many times, it will decrease in strength. Trans-lineage, however, is newly occurred impulsion by taking the object of ***nibbāna*** rather than the object of ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhamma***. Similarly the Noble Path is also newly occurred impulsion in other 'Sphere' (***bhūmi***) called the Supra-mundane Sphere (***lokuttarābhūmi***) rather than the sensual Sphere (***kāmabhūmi***).  

[**Notes**: - Those impulsions, 'Adaptation' and 'Trans-lineage', belong to Sensual Sphere  because  those  are  Great  Wholesome  Impulsions  of  Sensual  Sphere (***kamāvacara mahākusala javana***). The Noble Path belongs to the Supra-mundane Sphere indeed. Thus in the specific Sphere  called the Supra-mundane Sphere, the Noble Path can be said the newly occurred impulsion actually. It can be said that an impulsion which takes the same object in the same sphere falls in strength at fifth mind moment. It can not be said the 'Trans-lineage' falls in strength because it takes new object called ***nibbāna***. It can not be said the Noble Path also falls in strength because it not only takes new object called ***nibbāna*** but is a ***dhamma*** of the Supra-

mundane Sphere. 

**PAGE-444** 

` `It, therefore, means both 'Trans-lineage' and the Noble Path can occur at the fifth and sixth mind moments respectively.] 

Furthermore \_\_\_\_ there is a reasonable question that \_\_\_\_ due to presence of supporting  factor  of  Condition  of  Habitual  Recurrence  of  preceding  impulsion resulting in increase in strength, the seventh impulsion is not only ***upapajja vedaniya kamma*** (= the action which can give rise to result in second future existence) but also ***anantariya kamma*** (= the action which can give rise to result in any future existance rather than first and second ones). The meaning is as follows: -  

After benefiting to the following life- continuum by efficiency of the Condition of Contiguity, the seventh impulsion embedded its efficiency to that consequence life- continuum (***bhavanga vipāka***). That efficiency is carried along with the continuity of consequence (***vipāka sansati***). That continuity of consequence called life-continuum arising and passing away along with the whole life as interval of consciousness of congnitive processes (***vīthi citta***) and finally it occurs as the last mind moment with function of death of an existance. In this way the volition of seventh impulsion can be occurred as not only ***upapajjavendanīya kamma*** but also ***anantariya kamma*** because it can provide well in order to transmit its efficiency into continuity of consequence by means of Condition of Contiguity. It means that it can not be said the volition of seventh impulsion can occur as ***upapajjavedanīya kamma, anantariya kamma*** due to presence of natural strength like preceeding four impulsions. (***Mūlatī-1-117***).

` `**L  L  V  I  Ma  A  A  T  P  F  F  F  L...** 

` `L = life-continuum (***bhavanga***) 

` `V = life-continuum (vibration) (***bhavangacalana***) 

` `I = life-continuum (interruption) (***bhavangupeccheda***)

` `A = Adaptation 

` `T = Trans-lineage  

` `P = the Path (-moment) 

` `F = the Fruit (-moment) 

It can be said reasonably that \_\_ in the continuum of the great wise two times of  the  'Adaptation  (***anuloma***)  arise,  while  the  third  time  is  the  'Trans-lineage' (***gotrabhu***), the fourth one, the consciousness of the Noble Path. Afterwards three times of impulsion of the Fruit (-moment) (***phala javana***) arise and than it falls into life -continuum.  

(***Abhi-A-1-275***).

` `L  L  V  I  Ma  A  A  A  T  P  F  F  L ... 

In the continuum of the middle wise three times of the 'Adaptation' arise, while the fourth time is the 'Trans-lineage', the fifth one, the consciousness of the Noble Path. Afterwards two times of impulsions of the Fruit (-moment) arise and then it falls into life-continuum.  (***Abhi-A-1-275***) 

**4. (c) Cognitive Process of the Path (-moment) of the Slow Wise (manda pañña puggala).  L  L  V  I  Ma  A  A  A  A  T  P  F  L  L...** 

In the continuum of slow wise four times of the 'Adaptation' arise, while the fifth time is the 'Trans-lineage', the sixth one, the consciousness of the Noble Path. Afterwards only one time of impulsion of the Fruit (-moment) arise and then it falls into life-continuum. (***Abhi-A-1-275***).  

[Notes : - It is explained in exegesis that "this third method is presented due to consisting in olden commentary". This is not agreed with the Venerable ***Buddhagosa Thera***.  Therefore  the  occasion  with  four  times  of  'Adaptation'  is  rejected  in  the commentary of ***Visuddhi Magga***. Those designations various times of 'Adaptation', are shown by three different terms, Preliminary Work, Adaptation, Trans-lineage, as the next method which has been presented previously.] 

**PAGE-445** 

Among  those  three  kinds  of  persons,  it  will  be  explicit  an  example  of  the middle wise person rather than the great wise and slow wise ones, as follows: \_\_\_\_ 

On such occasion during ***vipassanā*** practice, the Noble Path called ***vuṭṭhana*** (= emerging)  arises.  On  that  occasion  during  ***vipassanā***  practice  indifferent  rootless mind-consciousness -element associating with neutrality feeling (***upekkhā*** ***sahagata kiriya ahetuka manoviññāṇa dhātu***) arises as the mind-door advertence by taking the object of corporeal and mental aggregates which are objects of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge and  the  continuity  of  life-continuum  has  been  cut  out.  Just  after  that  mind-door advertence, the first impulsion, Knowledge of Adaptation arises by taking the object which  is  the  same  as  previous  one.  After  performing  discernment  as  any  kind  of impermanence, suffering or non-self and removing gross bulk of darkness of delusion which is capable of concealing on Four Noble Truths not to be seen, resulting in making very obvious phenomena of three general characters, the first three general characters,  the  Adaptation  passed  away.  Adjacent  to  that  first  Knowledge  of Adaptation  is  the  second  Knowledge  of  Adaptation.  For  those  two  kinds  of Knowledge of Adaptation, the previous one had not got supporting factor of relation of Habitual Recurrence (due to lack of previous impulsion) but it was the supporting factor of Condition of Habitual Recurrence for the second Knowledge, of Adaptation. Due to presence of the supporting factor of Condition of Habitual Recurrence that second  knowledge  of  Adaptation  is  sharp,  penetrative,  efficacious  and  purified. Therefore it passes away after performing discernment as any kind of three general characters,  impermanence,  suffering  or  non  -  self  and  removing  middle  size  of darkness of delusion which is capable of concealing on Four Noble Truths not to be seen, resulting in making very obvious phenomena of three general characters. Just after that second Knowledge of Adaptation, the third knowledge of Adaptation arises contiguously.  That  second  Knowledge  of  Adaptation  was  the  supporting  factor  of relation of Habitual Recurrence for the third Knowledge of Adaptation again. Due to presence  of  the  supporting  factor  of  Condition  o  Habitual  Recurrence  that  third Knowledge  of  Adaptation  is  sharp,  penetrative,  efficacious  and  purified.  After performing  discernment  as  any  kind  of  three  general  characters,  impermanence, suffering or non - self and removing all remaining subtle darkness of delusion which is capable of concealing on Four Noble Truths, not to be seen, resulting in making very  obvious  phenomena  of  three  general  characters,  the  Third  impulsion  passes away. In this way, after removing all darkness called delusion which is capable of concealing on Four Noble Truths by three times of the Knowledge of Adaptation, The Knowledge of Trans-lineage arises by taking the object of ***nibbāna*** contiguously. 

**PAGE-446** 

For those words, the following is a parallel to be clear understood. A man with good sight looks the sky to observe The moon at night for the purpose of astronomical data. Due to presence of covering with clouds, the moon is unapparent in the sight of that man. At that time a kind of wind blows and removes very thick clouds. The next kind of wind blows and removes moderate thick clouds again. Then the third kind of wind blows and removes subtle clouds successively. Afterwards that man can see the moon in the clear sky, resulting in knowing astronomical phenomenon correctly. 

In above parallel, very thick darkness of defilements, moderate thick darkness of defilements and subtle darkness of defilements, which are capable of concealing on Four Noble Truths not to be known and seen, should be recognized as three kinds of clouds. The Knowledge of Trans-lineage should be recognized as the man with good sight Way of removing the darkness called delusion which is capable of concealing on Four Noble Truths by each Knowledge of Adaptation should be recognized as way of successive removing three kinds of clouds  by each kind  of wind. Performance of taking  the  object  of  ***nibbāna***  which  is  exceedingly  purified  by  the  Knowledge  of Trans-lineage when the darkness called delusion which is capable of concealing on Four Noble Truths, should be recognized as performance of seeing the clear moon in the clear sky by that man. 

It will be explicit. As three kinds of wind can remove those clouds that are capable of concealing on the moon but those are unable to see the moon, similarly, three times of successive Knowledge of Adaptation can remove pitch darkness called delusion that are capable of concealing on Four Noble Truths but those are unable to take the object of ***nibbāna***. As that man with good sight is able to see the moon only but he is unable to remove clouds, similarly, the Knowledge of Trans-lineage is able to take the object of ***nibbāna*** only, but it is unable to remove cloud of darkness or pitch darkness called defilements. Thus the Knowledge of Adaptation takes the object of  ***saṅkhāra  dhamma***  (conditioned  things)  while  the  Knowledge  of  Trans-lineage takes the object of ***nibbāna***. 

It will be explicit on unavoidable criticism. If the Knowledge of Trans-lineage continues to take the same object of ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhamma*** which had been taken by the Knowledge  of  Adaptation,  the  former  deserves  to  designate  as  the  Knowledge  of Adaptation  only  rather  than  the  Knowledge  of  Trans-lineage.  As  it  conforms  the knowledge  of  Adaptation  the  following  Knowledge  of  Adaptation  will  conform successively. If the same kinds of Knowledge of Adaptation occur successively, the Knowledge  of  Trans-lineage  that  is  able  to  benefit  by  efficiency  of  Condition  of Contiguity etc, can not occur as the mind - door advertence with the same object of the  Noble  Path,  resulting  in  inability  to  arise  the  Noble  Path  called  ***vuṭṭhāana*** (emerging) which emerges from the object of ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhamma*** really. 

**PAGE-447** 

Acutally the Knowledge of Translinlage, without taking the same object of ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas*** of the Knowledge of Adaptation, performs not to reappear that ‘Adaptation’ again and stands in for advertence though itself is not advertence and passes away after functioning as if it gives the symbol that “try to arise by taking the object of ***nibbāna*** in this way.’ (In this case, it is said by means of metaphorical usage called ***taddhammūpacā*** ***uparikkhyā*** in which the phrase as if it gives,” is applied though it lacks ability to give any thing.) 

The  Noble  Path,  without  refusing  the  symbol  given  by  that  Trans-lineage, arises contiguously by penetrating bulks of selfish desire, anger and delusion, which has never been penetrated in previous infinite rounds of rebirth. 

The following is a parallel for that process. An archer with a covering on his face stands up on the rotating shooting vehicle, which is about (100) metres far from target zone where (100) numbers of timber planks are put as target, and he is ready to shoot with a bow and an arrow. As assistant man rotates shooting vehicle and at such moment the archer faces with the target. At that time the assistant man gives a signal by striking on target by a stick. The archer, without neglecting to signal sound, shoots the arrow and then the arrow pierces hundred timber planks. 

For  those  words,  the  following  is  a  parallel  to  be  clear  understood.  The Knowledge  of  Trans-lineage  is  similar  to  sound  signal  by  striking  on  target.  The Noble Path - Knowledge is similar to the archer. The function of the Noble Path - Knowledge, without neglecting the signal given by the knowledge of Trans-lineage, which penetrates the bulk of selfish desire etc, that had not been penetrated along with infinite rounds of rebirth, is similar to the function of arrow, without neglecting the signal  of  sound  by  striking  on  target,  which  pierces  hundred  timber  planks.  This process  of  penetrating  and  breakthrough  the  bulk  of  selfish  desire,  etc.,  can  be designated  as  the  performance  of  total  eradication  of  all  defilements,  which  are capable of tying with the bond called cyclic ***dhamma*** (***vaṭṭa***), which are worth getting sphere  of  any  aggregate  of  next  existence  (***bhūmi-laddhavaṭṭasetusamugghāta kara***ṇ***a***). 

[**Note** - Various Kinds of underlying tendency (***anusayakiles***ā) which are deposited in aggregates that are the object of clinging is called ***bhūmiladdha*** because those are worth getting sphere called five aggregates that are the object of clinging before the Noble Path has not eradicated those kinds of underlying tendency. Due to capable of tying with the bond of three rounds, i.e, defilement round (***kilsa*** ***vaṭṭa)***,  volitional round (***kamma*** ***vaṭṭa)***, conseqeuence round (***vipāka vaṭṭa)***, those kinds of underlying tendency are also called ***vaṭṭa setu***. Four Kinds of the Noble Path eradicates step by step  all  kinds  of  underlying  tendency  called  ***bhūmiladdha  vaṭṭasetu***  without  any remains. Eradication in that way is penetrating and breakthrough into bulk of selfish desire, bulk of anger, bulk of delusion.] 

It  is  right.\_\_\_\_  The  single  function  of  the  Noble  Path  is  eradication  of underlying  tendency  indeed.  In  this  way,  after  eradicating  respective  kinds  of underlying  tendency,  it  can  be  said  that  the  Noble  Path  emerges  from  object  of phenomenon of ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhamma*** called ***nimitta***. It is said to be cut continuous occurring Cyclic ***dhamma*** (***vaṭṭa***) called ***pavaṭṭa***. (***Abhi-A-1- 275, 277***) 

**PAGE-448** 

***Palī*** ***Quotation*** (***Abhi-A-1-277***) 

***Nimitta***  \_\_\_\_  ***Saṅkhāra***  ***nimitta***  called  those  phenomena  of  corporeality, feeling, perception, ***kamma***-formation, consciousness, is designated as ***nimitta***. 

***Pavaṭṭa*** \_\_\_\_ The Cyclic ***dhamma*** which is capable of continuous processes called  corporeality,  feeling,  perception,  ***kamma***-formation,  consciousness,  is designated  as  ***pavaṭṭa***.  There  are  two  kinds  of  ***pavaṭṭa***,  ***upādinnaka***  ***pavaṭṭa***  and ***anupādinnaka*** ***pavaṭṭa***. 

For those two kinds, it is said that the Noble Path emerges from the second one, ***anupādinnaka*** ***pavaṭṭa*** because a hint of emerging from that kind should be seen. 

**5.A.  Way  of  emerging  from  continuity  of  *anupādinnaka*  aggregates (*anupādinnaka vuṭṭhāna*)** 

Detailed  account  can  be  seen  as  follows:  The  Path  of  Upstream  -  enterer (***sotāpatti  magga***)  eradicates  five  kinds  of  consciousness,  viz,  four  kinds  of consciousness  associating  with  wrong  view  (***diṭṭhigata  sampayutta  citta***),  one consciousness with sceptic (***vicikicchā*** ***sahagata citta***). Those kinds of consciousness are able to produce ***cittaja rūpa*** (corporeality produced by mind, CPM). Those CPM (***cittaja  rūpa***)  which  are  caused  by  those  five  kinds  of  consciousness  are  called ***anupadinnaka rūpakkhandna***. (It means that due to occurrence of CPM, resulting in the absence of ***upādinnaka*** called corporeality produced by ***kamma*** (CPK), it is meant as ***anupadinnaka rūpakkhandh***ā. It means the corporeal aggregate, as the resultant occurrence of ***kamma***, which is adhered by craving - wrong view but not deserving to obsess  as  mine  is  called  ***anupādinnaka  rūpakkhandh***ā).  Those  five  kinds  of consciousness belong to the aggregate of consciousness. Thos mental concomitants, feeling, perception, ***kamma***-formations, which are associating with those five kinds of consciousness belong to three mental aggregates, aggregate of feeling, aggregate of perception, aggregate of ***kamma-***formations, respectively, resulting in five aggregates totally. 

Unless the so - called Upstream - enterer person (***sotāpanna***) achieves the Path 

- Knowledge of Upstream - enterer, those five kinds of consciousness will be aroused by  six  kinds  of  objects.  However  because  that  Noble  One  achieves  the  Path  - Knowledge  of  Upstream  -  enterer  that  Noble  Path  emerges  from  ***anupādinnaka*** ***pavaṭṭa*** called five aggregates mentioned above, by cutting causal ***dhamma*** called defilements which are capable of tying with bond of cyclic ***dhamma*** after prohibitting not to arouse those five kinds of consciousness which have no opportunity to rise again in future. Thus it is called the process of emerging from ***anupādinnaka pavaṭṭa***. The  Path  of  Once  -  returnee  (***sakadagamimagga***)  eradicates  six  kinds  of 

consciousness, viz, four kinds of consciousness without wrong view and two kinds of 

consciousness rooted in hate which are having feature of gross sensual desire and ill - will (***vyāpāda***). The Path of Non returnee (***anāgāmimagga***) eradicates those same six kinds of consciousness, which are having feature of subtle sensual desire and ill - will. The  Path  of  Arahant  (***arahatta  magga***)  eradicates  five  kinds  of  unwholesome consciousness, viz, four kinds of consciousness without wrong view called desire to become  as  world  of  form  (***rūparāga***)  desire  to  become  as  Formless  World  (***arūparāga***), and consciousness with unrest (***uddhacca sahagata citta***). 

**PAGE-449** 

Unless those so - called Noble Ones achieve respective Path - Knowledge, those kinds of unwholesome consciousness will be a roused by six kinds of objects. However, because those Noble ones achieve respective Path-Knowledge, those Noble Paths emerge from ***anupādinnaka*** ***pavaṭṭa*** called five aggregates by cutting causal ***dhamma*** called defilements which are capable of tying with bond of cyclic ***dhamma*** after prohibitting not to arouse those kinds of unwholesome consciousness which have no opportunity to arise again in future. This is the way of emerging from continuity of ***anupādinnaka*** aggregates. (***Abhi-A-1-277, 278***) 

**5.B. Way of Emerging from continuity of *upādinnaka* aggregates (*upādinnaka vuṭṭahāna*)** 

After saying that ‘‘ a hint called emerging from ***upādinnaka*** ***pavaṭṭa*** should be seen  ’’  it  is  also  said  that  the  Noble  Path  emerges  from  ***upādinnaka***  ***pavaṭṭa***. (***upādinnaka*** means mundane consequence mental aggregates and CPK (***Kammaja rūpa***), which are surrounded and adhered by ignorance, craving, clinging, which are deserving to obsess an occurrence of consequence as ‘‘ the action (***Kamma***) is my consequence.”  The  term,  ***upādinnaka  pavaṭṭa***  means  continuous  processes  of continuity of those aggregates. Detailed account can be seen as follows.\_\_\_\_ 

Unless the so - called Upstream - enterer person achieves the Path - Knowledge of  Upstream  -  enterer,  the  continuous  processes  of  continuity  of  ***upādinnaka*** aggregates (***upādinnaka pavaṭṭa)*** will be occurred for very fong infinite rounds of rebirth  irrespective  of  seven  times  of  existences.  This  is  because  -------   those defilements, which are causal ***dhamma***s of arising of ***upādinnaka*** ***pavaṭṭa*** are still present, indeed. As soon as the Path of Upstream - enterer arises, however, it can eradicate these five kinds of defilements, viz, three kinds of fetters (***samyojana***) called fetter  of  wrong  view  on  personality  (***sakkrūpaya  diṭṭhi  samyojana***),  two  kinds  of underlying  tendency  called  underlying  tendency  of  wrong  view  (***diṭṭhanusaya***), underlying tendency of sceptic (***vicikicchā*** ***nusaya***). After eradicating in this way, in the continuum of Upstream enterer in recent, except sever times of existences, there will  be  impossibility  to  arise  ***upādinnaka  pavaṭṭa***  (=  continuous  processes  of continuity of ***upādinnaka*** aggregates) for very long infinite rounds of rebirth. Thus it is known as the Path of Upstream - enterer emerges from ***upādinnaka pavaṭṭa*** by performing not to arise continuous occurrence of ***upādinnaka*** ***pavaṭṭa***. (***Abhi-A-1- 278***) 

**6.A. Determination on seven times of existence** 

***Palī*** ***Quotation (Anutī-1-124)*** 

It is explained that seven times of existences means alternative processes of **n**ewly  **o**ccurrence  of  **n**ext  **e**xistence  (**NONE**)  between  heavenly  being  of  sensual sphere and human being for seven times. It does not mean that the same processes of **NONE** occur seven times in the same sphere continuously. The Buddha preached the phrase,  “***na  te  bhavam  aṭṭhamam***  ā  ***diyanti***”’  (  =  That  Upstream  -  enterer  never accepts eighth existence) in ***Ratana Sutta***, with referring to mixture of both human and heavenly 

**PAGE-450** 

existences really. Some noble teachers suggested that there is no limit of these seven times of existences in fine - material and immaterial spheres which are of the lineage of the Noble - Ones who have ***nibbāna*** as their aim (***mahaggata***). 

**6.B Three kinds of Upstream - enterer** 

This phrase, “that Upstream - enterer never accepts eighth existence,” is said with referring to the lowest kind, ***sattakkhattuparama*** kind of Upstream - enterer who prefers to accept up to seven times of existences. After attaining the Path of Upstream 

- enterer, the ability to attain upper ones depends on maturity of controlling faculties called, faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom. 
1. The Upstream - enterer with sharply matured controlling faculties will 

become Arahant after getting only once process of NONE (***paṭisandhi***). That kind of person is designated as ***ekabījisotāpanna*** ( - the Upstream - enterer with only one seed of process of NONE). 

2. The Upstream - enterer who has from two to six seeds of processes of 

NONE,  compared  with  the  first  on,  is  the  person  having  moderately  matured controlling faculties. That kind of person is called ***kolankola*** = the Upstream - enterer who never reaches to inferior race but is able to reach from one nobility to another nobility. 

3. The Upstream - enterer who has seven seeds of processes of NONE is 

the  person  having  retarded  controlling  faculties.  That  kind  of  person  is  called sattakkhattu parama - the Noble one with maximums of seven times of processes of NONE. 

Pali - (***Paṭisam-A-2-67***) 

Limitation of numbers of existances of these three kinds of Upstream - enterer is said to be referred to the Sensual Sphere only but those kinds of Upstream - enterers in  Fire  -  material  and  immaterial  Sphere  can  get  numerous  times  of  processes  of NONE.

**6.C. Determining factors** 

There  are  different  opinions  relating  to  determining  factors  of  variation  in Upstream - enterer persons among noble teachers. Different opinions were explained 

in the commentary called ***Puggala Paññatti*** (Nomenclature of Persons) (***Abhi-A-3-***

***47***) and then the abstract is as follows: - 

Determining factors in that way are \_\_\_\_ 

1. Some teachers suggested that it is previous factors of ***kamma*** (***pubba hetu***), 
1. Some  teachers  suggested  that  it  is  the  Path  of  Upstream  -  enterer  (***pathama magga***), 
1. Some teachers suggested that it is the Upper Three Kinds of Noble Path, 
1. Some teachers suggested that it is the efficiency of ***vipassanā*** practice before Upper Three Kinds of Noble Path; respectively. 

Among those four opinions, it was finally proved that the last one is the most appropriate  opinion  with  referring  to  this  quotation,‘‘tinnam  magganam  ***vipassanā*** ***niyānmetīti vādo pana yujjati***, (***Abhi-A-3-47***). 

However in the commentary of ***Paṭtisambhidā*** ***Magga***, \_\_\_\_\_ it is explained that \_\_\_\_ 

(***Paṭisam***-***A-2-67***) 

- Various degrees of matureness of controlling faculties of those three kinds of 

Upstream  enterer  were  determined  by  previous  factors  of  ***Kamma***  (***pubbahetu***). (***Paṭisam-A-2-67***)  

This  opinion  is  the  same  as  the  opinion  of  the  first  teacher  found  in  the commentary of ***Puggala Paññatti***. 

**6.D. Further explanations** 

Among those four opinions mentioned above, in the first one which suggested that  determining  factor  of  variation  in  Upstream  -  enterers  is  previous  factors  of ***kamma***  (pubbahetu),  there  is  an  unavoidable  criticism  that  ‘‘it  can  be  said  the powerful  determinative  dependence  of  the  first  Path  was  achieved  by  porevious factors of ***kamma,*** while three kinds of the Upper Ones arise without any powerful determinative dependence.’’ 

Then in the second one which suggested that determining factor of variation in Upstream - enterers is the Path of Upstream - enterer, There is also an unavoidable criticism that those Upper Three Kinds of Noble Path are ineffective ones. 

In  the  third  one  which  suggested  that  determining  factor  of  Variation  in Upstream  -  enterers  is  the  Upper  Three  Kinds  of  Noble  Path,  there  is  also  an unavoidable criticism that the Upper Three Kinds of Noble Path had been occurred beforehand. 

The  reasonable  opinion,  therefore,  is  the  last  one  which  suggested  that ‘‘determining factor of variation in Upstream enterers is the efficiency of ***vipassanā*** practice before Upper Three Kinds  of Noble Path, is an  appropriate opinion. The reason why it is an appropriate one is as follows. \_\_\_\_\_. 

If the efficiency of ***vipassanā*** practice before Upper Three Kinds of Noble Path is very strong, due to presence of powerful ***vipassanā*** resulting in ability to attain Upper ones merely has to get a process of NONE for an existence, it is designated as ***ekabīji*** Upstream - enterer. Due to presence of less efficiency of ***vipassanā*** practice, compared to that of ***vipassanā*** practice which is the factor of occurrence of ***ekabīji*** kind of Upstream - enterer, ***kolankola*** kind of Upstream - enterer can be occurred. Due  to  presence  of  the  least  efficiency  of  ***vipassanā***  practice  among  three  kinds, ***sattakkhattuparama*** kind of Upstream - enterter can be occurred. Therefore the last opinion, only the fourth one which suggested that ‘‘determining factor of variation in Upstream enterers is the efficiency of ***vipassanā*** practice before Upper Three Kinds of Noble Path,’’ is appropriate really. (***Abhi-A-3-47***) 

To be noticed \_\_\_\_\_ By means of designation of the Buddha only these three terms, ***sattakkhattuparama***, ***Kolankola, ekabīji***, are names of three kinds of Upstream 

- enterers. The Upstream - enterer person who reaches so long as these existence, is designated as ***sattakkhattuparama*** while the Upstream enterer who reaches so long as 

**PAGE-452** 

these existences, is designated as ***kolankola***, the Upstream - enterer who reaches so long  as  These  existences,  is  designated  as  ***ekabīji***  according  to  the  nomenclature specified by the Buddha. Though that nomenclature had been specified there is no certain  determination  as  “this  person  is  sattakkhattu  parama  kind  of  Upstream  – enterer” and so forth. (***Abhi-A-3-46***) 

**6.E. Explanation found in the commentary of Sammohavinodant** 

***Parli Quotation (Abh -A-2- 411)*** 

There is nobody who was specified certainly so as to accept seven existences. If the Noble One has retarded reasoning efficiency (***mandapañña***), due to presence of any factor, he will enter into ***nibbāna*** between seventh and eigth existences but not reaching to the eighth existence. Even the Upstream - enterer who is vey sestful in rounds of rebirth like King Sakka has to go till seventh existence only. During the seventh  existence  only  he  will  be  reached  into  matured  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge eventually even though any kind of Upstream - enterer with full of carelessness by all manner  of  means.  By  means  of  even  minute  measurable  object  of  any  kind  the Knowledge  of  Disenchantment  is  matured  resulting  in  reaching  into  cessation  of defilements. It is right. \_\_ During the seventh existence of that Upstream - enterer, by the time even any kind of these scandals occurs, as if he is decapitated by somebody with the help of very sharp four - edged dagger while he falls asleep or he faces and walks other direction or as if he is killed by submerging, there is no death with the process  of  NONE  (***paṭisandhi***).  Only  when  the  Fruit  -  Knowledge  of  Arahant (***arahatta phala***) has been achieved, the final passing away of him has to be finished. 

Therefore,  the  words  ***aṭṭhamam  bhavam  nibbatteyya,netam***  ṭ***hānam  vijjāti. (Abhi-2-349)***  =  There  is  no  principle  of  this  kind,  “the  person  with  the  Path  - knowledge of Upstream - enterer has to get eighth existence,” had been preached by the Buddha in this way. (***Abhi-A-2-411***). 

If  this  word  mentioned  above  is  also  interpreted  that  the  commentator explained  it  with  referring  to  those  existences  in  Sensual  Sphere  only  ,  those explanations found in the commentary and sub - commentary do not contradict each other. 

After discussing on three kinds of Upstream - enterers, it will be continued to present way of emerging of Upper Three Kinds of Noble Path from ***pavaṭṭa***. 

**7.  Way of energing of Upper Three Kinds of Noble Path from ‘*pavatta*’** Unless  the  so  -  called  Once  -  returnee  (***sakadāgāmi***)  achieves  the  Path  - Knowledge of Once-returnee, the continuous processes of continuity of ***upādinnaka*** aggregates  (***upādinnaka***  ***khandha***  ***pavaṭṭa***)  will  be  occurred  for  five  times  of existences, irrespective of two times of existences due to presence of possibility of two times out of seven times of existence for Upstream - enterer. This is because those defilements, which are causal ***dhamma***s of arising of ***upadinnaka khandha pavaṭṭa***, are still present indeed. As soon as the Path of Once - returnee arises however, it can eradicate these four kinds of defilements, viz, fetter of gross sensual desire, fetter of gross  hatred  (***patigha  samyojana***),  underlying  tendency  of  gross  sensual  desire (***kamarāganusaya***),  underlying  tendency  of  gross  hatred  (***paṭighanusaya***).  After eradicating in this way, in the continuum of Once - returnee in recent, except two times of existences, There will be impossibility to arise ***upadinnaka khandha pavaṭṭa*** ( = continuous processes of continuity of ***upādinnaka*** aggregates) for five times of existences. Thus it is known as the Path of Once - returnee emerges from ***upādinnaka*** ***khanda  pavaṭṭa***  by  performing  not  to  arise  continuous  process  of  ***upādinnaka*** khandhapa***vaṭṭa***. (***Abhi-A-1-278***). 

**Two times of existence** \_\_\_\_\_ If the Once - returnee person is alive without performing to attain the Path of Non - returnee (***anāgāmimagga***), he has to get two times  of  existences  as  ***upādinnaka  khandha  pavaṭṭa***.  Except  those  two  times  of existences there will be no further continuous occurrence of ***upādinnaka*** ***khandha pavaṭṭa***. In this case, two times of existences refer to the heavenly being of Sensual Sphere and human existence indeed. In those existences of fine - material Sphere and Immaterial Sphere, not only the Once - returnee person but the Non - returnee also has to get many times of existences in Pure Abode (***suddhāvāsabhūmi***). 

***Pali - Quotation*** (***Anu***ṭī***-1-124***)  

Unless the so - called Non - returnee (***anāgami***) achieves the Path - Knowledge of Non - returnee, the continuous processes of continuity of ***upādinnaka*** aggregates (***upādinnaka***  khandnpa***vaṭṭa)***  will  be  occurred  for  coming  second  existence, irrespective  of  existences  of  Fine-material  sphere  and  Immaterial  Sphere.  This  is because  those  defilements,  which  are  causal  ***dhamma***s  of  arising  of  ***upādinnaka*** ***khandha pavaṭṭa***, are still present indeed. As soon as the Path of Non - returnee arises, however, it can eradicate these four kinds of defilements, viz, fetter of subtle sensual desire,  fetter  of  subtle  hatred  (***paṭighasamyojana***),  underlying  tendency  of  subtle sensual  desire  (***kamarāganusaya***),  underlying  tendency  of  subtle  hatred (***paṭighanusaya***). After eradicating in this way, in the continuum of Non - returnee in recent, except those existences of Fine-material Sphere and Immaterial Sphere, There will  be  impossibility  to  arise  ***upādinnakadha***  ***pavaṭṭa***  (=  continuous  processes  of continuity of ***upādinnaka*** aggregates) for coming second existence. Thus it is known as  the  Path  of  Non  -  returnee  emerges  from  ***upādinnaka***  ***khandha  pavaṭṭa***  by performing not to arise continuous processes of ***upādinnaka*** ***khandha pavaṭṭa***. 

(***Abhi-A-1-278***) 

***Pali Quotation (Mūla***ṭī***-1-117)*** 

The commentary interpreted as ‘‘***ekobhava*** - single existence’’ by means of lack of return back to lower Sensual Sphere again, due to occurrence of only one kind of the lineage of the Noble Ones who have ***nibbāna*** as their aim though the Non- returnee has to get many existences repeatedly in Fire-material Sphere and Immaterial Sphere. (***Mūla***ṭī***-1-117***) 

Unless the so - called Arahant (***arahanta***) achieves the Path - Knowledge of Arahant,  the  continuous  processes  of  continuity  of  ***upādinnaka***  aggregates (***upādinnaka*** ***khandha pavaṭṭa)*** will be occurred in existances of Fine-material Sphere and Immaterial Sphere. This is because those defilements, which are causal ***dhamma***s of arising of ***upādinnaka khandha pavaṭṭa***, are still present indeed. As soon as The Path of Arahant arises, however, it can eradicate these eight kinds of defilements, viz, desire  to  existence  of  Fine  -  material  Sphere  (***rūparaga***),  desire  to  existence  of Immateerial  Sphere  (***arūparaga***),  conceit  (***mana***)  unrest  (***uddhacca***),  ignorance (***avijj***ā),  which  are  called  five  kinds  of  the  upper  fetters  (***samyojana***),  underlying tendency  of  conceit  (***manānusaya***),  underlying  tendency  of  desire  to  existence (***bhavarāganusaya***),  underlying  tendency  of  ignorance  (***avijjānusaya***),  which  are called three kinds of ***anusaya***. After eradicating in this way, in the continuum of Arahant in recent, there will be impossibility to arise ***upādinnaka*** ***khandha pavaṭṭa*** ( 

- continuous processes of ***upādinnaka*** aggregates) for any future existence. Thus it is known  as  the  Path  of  Arahant  emerges  from  ***upādinnaka  khandha***  ***pavaṭṭa***  by performing not to arise continuous processes of ***upādinnaka khandhapavaṭṭa***. (***Abhi- A-278, 279***) 

It  will  be  continued  to  explain.  \_\_\_\_\_  If  the  word,  “***upādinnaka  khandha*** ***pavaṭṭa***,” will be designated as “the name of existence,” among these Four Kinds of Noble  Path,  The  Path  of  Upstream  -  enterer  emerges  from  woeful  existence (***apāyabhava***), while the Path of Once - returnee, from partial existence called joyful existence of Sensual Sphere (***kāmasugatibhava***), the Path of Non - returnee, from all kinds of existences of Sensual Sphere. Noble teachers said that the Path of Arahant emerges from all kinds of existences really. (***Abhi-A-1-279***) 

In order to be clear understood on the meaning of those words, “the Noble Path emerges from ***upādinnaka khandha pavaṭṭa***.” mentioned above, the following is an evidence  of  Pali  Text  called  ***Ajitamāṇavapucchāniddesa,  Pārāyana  Vagga, C***ūļ***aniddesa***.

Due  to  cessation  of  ***abhisaṅkhāra***  ***viññāṇa***  (  =  ***kamma***  ***viññāṇa***)  which  is capable  of providing to arise the consequence new existance, resulting from the path of Upstream - enterer, except seven times of existences, such ***dhamma***s of either mentality or corporeality will be occurred for very long infinite rounds of rebirth. Due to efficacy of this Path - Knowledge of Upstream - enterer, these corporeal and mental ***dhammas*** will be ceased, will be came to an end; will be reached into cessation; and will be peaceful.

- returnee due to inability to arise the Path of Non - returnee). Due to efficacy of this Path Knowledge of Non - returnee,  these corporeal and  mental ***dhamma***s will be ceased became to an end; will be reached into cessation; and will be peaceful. 

Due to cessation of ***abhisaṅkhāra*** ***viññāṇa*** ( = ***Kamma*** ***viññāṇa***) which is capable of providing to arise the consequence new existence, resulting from the Path of Arahant, such ***dhammas*** of either mentality or corporeality will be occurred as the Non - returnee hood of either Fine-material Element (Sphere) or Immaterial Element (Sphere), unless the Noble Path of Arahant is achieved. Due to efficacy of this Path - Knowledge of Arahant, these corporeal and mental ***dhamma***s will be ceased; will be came  to  an  end;  will  be  reached  into  cessation;  and  will  be  peaceful.  When  the Arahant has taken the final passing away without any remains of consequence metal aggregates  and  C.  P.  K  (***Kammaja  rūpa***),  due  to  cessation  of  final  death- consciousness, with the nature of non-reappearance in future (***anuppāda nirodha***), these ***dhamma***s which are of any kind the wisdom or the mindfulness, the corporeality or mentality will be ceased; will became to an end; will be reached into cessation; and will be peaceful. (***Khu-8-33 C***ūļ***a niddesa, Abhi-A-1-279***) 

***abhisaṅkhāra*** ***viññāṇa***\_\_\_\_\_ The word, ***abhisaṅkhāra***, as ***puññābhi saṅkhāra*** etc,  means  ***kamma***  (  =  volition)  which  is  capable  of  providing  to  arise  resultant ***dhamma***.   Therefore  ***abhisaṅkhāra***  ***viññāṇa***  means  the  consciousness  which  is associating with that ***kamma*** ( = volition) and it is also known as ***kammaviññāṇa***. When  the  Path-Knowledge  of  Upstream  -  enterer  is  achieved,  the  causal ***abhisaṅkhāra*** ***viññāṇa***, which can give rise resultant ***dhamma*** after ceasing seven times  of  existence,  is  also  ceased.  Therefore  consequence  mentality  and  C.  P.  K (***Kammajarūpa***)  never  arise  after  ceasing  seven  times  of  existences.  It  should  be recognized similarly on the ceasing of ***abhisaṅkhāra*** ***viññāṇa*** by the Path-Knowledge of Once-returnee etc. (In this case, opinion of seven times of existences etc. should be recognized as mentioned above.) 

***nirodha - (Pali Quotation - (Mūla***ṭī ***-1-117)*** 

Cessation  of  ***abhisaṅkhāra***  ***viññāṇa***  \_\_\_\_\_  The  volition  (***Kamma***)  called ***abhisaṅkhere*** ***viññāṇa***, is the ***dhamma*** which is not worth eradicating by each Noble Path resulting in presence of reasonable question that how does ***Kamma*** (the volition) called  ***abhisaṅkhāra  viññāṇa***  cease?  The  answer  is  that  \_\_\_\_\_  ***abhisaṅkhāra*** ***viññāṇa*** is able to provide the occurrence of consequence ***dhamma*** (***vipāka*** ***dhamma***) only in the presence of companion called ignorance - craving (***avijā*** ***- tanha***). Those ignorance - craving are indeed ***dhammas*** which are worth eradicating by the Noble Path. If Noble Path ***dhamma***s eradicate the causal ***dhamma***s, ignorance – 

**PAGE-456** 

` `craving,  ***abhisaṅkhāra***  ***viññāṇa***  is  also  reached  into  cessation.  Therefore,  the cessation of causal ignorance - craving can be said as the cessation of ***abhisaṅkhāra*** ***viññāṇa***  by  a  metaphorical  usage,  ***kara***ṇū  ***pacāra***  in  which  the  name  of  cause  is applied to the name of result. It should, therefore, be recognized the fact that the process of eradication of defilements, which are causal ***dhamrnas***  of ***abhisaṅkhāra*** ***viññāṇa*** ( that is capable of providing the occurrence in existences of both woeful ones and joyful ones beyond seven times of existences) is called the cessation of ***abhisaṅkhāra***  ***viññāṇa***  by  the  Path-Knowledge  of  Upstream-enterer.  It  should  be recognized similarly on the cessation of each ***abhisaṅkhāra*** ***viññāṇa*** by respective kind of the upper Noble Path. (See on ***Mūla***ṭī***-1-117***) 

This  is  the  determination  on  the  way  of  emerging  of  the  Noble  Path  from ***nimitta*** and ***pavaṭṭa*** found in the commentary called ***Atthasālina***. (***Abhi-A-1-277, 279***) 

**8.8.A *anupadadhamma* *Vipassan***ā** 

***Pali Qutation (Mūla***ṭī***-1-109)*** 

Those methods of ***vipassanā*** practices, viz, generalization method on two kinds of  corporeality  and  mentality,  generalization  method  on  five  kinds  of  aggregates, generalization method on twelve kinds of bases, generalization method on eighteen kinds of elements, generalization method on twelve corps of Dependent - Origination etc., are called ***kalāpsammasana*** ***vipassanā*** method by which the ultimate ***dhammas*** are discerned and generalized commonly as ***anicca, dukkha, anatta.*** 

The  generalization  method  on  any  one  of  specific  corporeal  ***dhamma***  or specific mental ***dhamma***, for example, in the aspect of corporeality, each ultimate element, the earth - element etc, consisting in various corporeal units, eye-decad etc, or  in the aspect of mantality, each ultimate mental ***dhamma***, the contact (***phassa***) etc, consisting in various mental units, mental ***dhamma***s of the first absorption etc, is called  ***anupada***  ***dhamma***  ***vipassanā***  method  which  is  achieved  by  means  of discriminative knowledge on specific individual ***dhamma***, the ‘earth - element,’ the ‘contact ’ etc. (***Mūla***ṭī***-1-109,  Abhi-A-1-253***) 

Thus  there  are  two  methods  of  ***vipassanā***  practices,  ***kalāpasammāasana*** ***vipassanā***  method  and  ***anupadhamma***  ***vipassanā***  method  and  then  those  methods presented in previous Sections, are only the first kind, ***kalāpasammāsana*** ***vipassanā*** method. Unless the practising meditator achieves ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge leading to emerging  though  he  performs  through  various  kinds  of  these  ***kalapavipassanā*** methods he has to change and practice ***anupada dhamma*** ***vipassanā*** method. 

The method of ***anupādaddamma*** ***vipassanā*** can be found in ***Aupada Sutta, Anupada Vagga, Uparipa***ṇṇā***sa (M-3-375)***. For example, the meditator has to enter the  first  absorption  of  mindfulness  of  breathing.  Afterwards  the  contact  (***phassa***) consisting in (34) kinds of mental ***dhammas*** of that first absorption, must be kept in mind  specifically  and  it  must  be  discerned  by  means  of  three  general  characters, impermanance  (***anicca***),  suffering  (***dukkha***),  non-self  (***anatta***).  Similarly  those remaining mental ***dhamma***s must be discerned specifically by means of three general characters  called  ***vipassanā***  practice.  If  the  meditator  has  attained  eight  kinds  of attainment (***samāpatti***) on each ten kinds of ***kasi***ṇ***a*** each ultimate mental ***dhamma*** of all kind's of attainment, except the absorption of neither - perception – nor – non - perception, must be kept in mind specifically and discerned similarly by ***vipassanā*** practice. All disciples (***sāvaka***) of the Buddha, are unable to discern mental ***dhammas*** of the absorption of neither - perception - nor - non - perception by means of ***anupada*** ***dhamma*** ***vipassanā*** method but by means of ***kalāpasammasana*** ***vipassanā*** method only. The way of ***anupāda*** ***dhamma*** ***vipassanā*** on mental ***dhammas*** of that absorption is the specific for the Supreme Buddha with the Knowledge of Omniscience only indeed. (See ***Abhi-1-253***) 

After  analyzing  on  individual  corporeal  ***dhammas***  consisting  in  various corporeal units of six doors (***dvāra***) and (42) bodily parts, every corporeal ***dhamma***, the earth-element etc, can be discerned by means of ***anupāda dhamma vipassanā*** method. As shown in table of corporeal ***dhammas***, ***Volume I, Section 4***. 

Similarly  individual  mental  ***dhamma***s  within  various  mind  moments  called mental  ***dhammas***  of  sensual  sphere  (***kamāvacara  mental  dhamma***),  eye-door cognitive process etc, can also be discerned by ***anupādahamma vipassnā*** method. 

In this way, if a meditator practice either any method of these two kinds or both two  methods, ***kalāpasammasana*** method, ***anupādadhamma*** ***vipassanā***  method, he can reach the ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging in accordance with his previous perfection (***paramita***). 

**8.8.B. An elaborate method of the practice on Mentality (*nāmakammaṭṭhāna*)** 

In the section of ***nāmakammaṭṭhāna*** volume II, elaborate method of discerning on mental ***dhamma***s has been presented. Those mental ***dhamma***s, which are kept in mind by elaborate method, can be discerned as objects of ***anupadadhamna*** ***vipassanā*** method by means of there general characters from the stages knowledge of comprehension  (***sammasana  ñāṇa***),  knowledge  of  Arising  and  Passing  Away (***undayabbaya***  ***ñāṇa***)  until  knowledge  of  Neutrality  Towards  formations (***saṅkhārupekhā*** ***ñāṇa***).  

Unless  the  meditator  achieve  the  great  success  up  to  the  Path  knowledge though he endeavours strenuously various methods of ***vipassanā*** practices mentioned above or if the meditator, himself, wants to practise elaborate method of the practice on  mentality,  all  kinds  of  individual  mental  ***dhamma***s  must  be  kept  in  mind  and discerned as the objects of ***anupādadhamma***  ***vipassanā*** practice. 

If  will  be  presented  further  explanation  on  way  of  discerning  again  for inexperienced  person.  For  example,  after  keeping  in  mind  all  kinds  of  mental ***dhammas***  of  both  wholesome  impulsion  (***kusala  javana***)  and  unwholesome impulsion, which are arising by taking the object of individual corporealities of (54) kinds consisting in eye (eye door). Those mental ***dhamma***s must be discerned by three general characters one by one. Similarly after keeping in mind all kinds of mental ***dhammas***  of  both  wholesome  impulsion  and  unwholesome  impulsion,  which  are arising by taking either the object of individual corporealities of (54) kinds or (44) kinds consisting in remaining doors, ear etc, or The object of individual corporealities of  each  bodily  part  ,  (44)kinds  etc,  belonging  to  (42)  bodily  part  ,Those  mental ***dhammas*** must be discerned by three  general characters one by one. 

During discerning in that way after performing ***vipassanā*** practice on mental ***dhammas*** which are arising by taking the object of the earth element consisting of eye-decad, ***vipassanā*** practice must be continued to perform by discerning on mental ***dhammas*** which are arising by taking the object of the water element consisting of the same corporeal unit, the eye-decad with (10) kinds of corporeal ***dhammas*** that is a component of (54) kinds of corporealities in eye-door. In this way, after performing ***vipassanā*** practice on mental ***dhammas*** which are arising by taking the object of each corpureality among (10) kinds of corporealities of eye-decad, ***vipassanā*** practice must be  continued  to  perform  by  discerning  on  mental  ***dhammas***  which  are  arising  by taking the object of each corporeality among (10) kinds of corporealities of body- decad within the same door, eye-door in serial order. Afterwards mental ***dhammas***, 

**PAGE-459** 

which are arising by taking the object of each corporeality of (54) kinds of eye-door in the  continuum  of  external  ones  (***bahiddha***)  must  be  discerned  as  the  object  of ***anupādadhamma*** ***vipassanā*** practice. Then ***vipassanā*** practice must be carried on by changing  to  remaining  doors,  ear  door  etc,  in  serial  order.  It  must  be  discerned similarly on (42) bodily parts one by one. 

If all kinds of corporeal ***dhamma***s consisting of those (6) kinds of doors, (42) bodily parts, are classified in the aspect of object, there are only (6) kinds of objects. These objects within each corporeal unit, can be grouped as \_\_\_\_\_ 

1. Colour is the visible object (***rūpāramma***ṇ***a***) 
1. Smell is the olfactory object (***gandhāramma***ṇ***a***) 
1. taste is the gustative object (***rasāamma***ṇ***a***) 
1. earth-element,  fire-element,  air-element  are  tactile  objects 

(***phoṭṭhabbāramma***ṇ***a***) 

5. the sound consisting of sound nonad of inbreath - outbreath (***assāsapassāsa*** 

***sadda navaka kalāpa***) etc. is the auditory object (***saddāramma***ṇ***a***),

(***sukhumarūpa***) water-element, sex corporeality (***bhāvarūpa***) physical vitality (***jīvita***), heart-base  (***hadaya  vatthu***  ***rūpa***),  celar-semsitivity  etc,  are  cognizable-object (***dhammāramma***ṇ***a***) . 

After keeping in mind those mental ***dhammas***, as mentioned in various lines, colour-line, sound-line etc, ***vipassanā*** practice must be carried out by observing those mental  ***dhammas***.  All  kinds  of  wholesome  and  unwholesome  cognitive  processes must be discerned thoroughly. 

During  performing  ***vipassanā***  practice,  both  two  kinds,  ***kalāpasammassana*** method  and  ***anupādadhamma***  ***vipassanā***  method  can  be  performed  as  he  like. Depending upon previous perfection of the ***meditator***, ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging will be reached accordingly.

It  was  by  the  time  the  Buddha  stayed  in  ***Sāvathi***.  At  that  time  a  *bhikkhu* approached the Buddha and worshiped respect fully: afterwards he sat down at an appropriate place and then he asked as follows. 

"Bhante  the  Supreme  Buddha  it  is  worth  designating  as  The  "Ignorance (***avijj***ā)",  which  ***dhamma***  is  the  ignorance?;  how  does  a  person  reach  into  the ignorance?".

It  was  by  the  time  the  Buddha  stayed  in  ***Sāvatthi***.  At  that  time  a  *bhikkhu* approached the Buddha and worshipped respectfully; afterwards he sat down at an appropriate place and then he asked as follows. 

"Bhante  the  Supreme  Buddha  it  is  worth  designating  as  The  "Knowledge (***avijj***ā), "which ***dhamma*** is the Knowledge? ; how much means does a person reach into the Knowledge?".

*Bhikkhu*... the person who knows and sees penetratively in this way can remove the nescience (= the ignorance ***avijj***ā) but arise the science (= the knowledge , ***vijj***ā) preached by the Buddha. (***Sam -2-259, 260, Avijjāpahānasutta***) 

By  means  of  paying  attention  respectfully  to  these  noble  preachings,  the practising ***meditator*** has to endeavour to remove the ignorance (***avijj***ā) and to arise the light of knowledge (***vijj***ā). 

***Paṭipadāñāṇa dassana visuddhi niddesa*** has been finished.

**VII*. Ñ*ĀṆ*ADASSANA VISUDDHI NIDDESA*** 

**9.11  The  First  Path  Knowledge  =  The  Path  Knowledge  of  Upstream  enterer** (***sotāpattimagga ñāṇa***) 

Just  after  this  knowledge  of  Adaptation  (***anulomañāṇa***)  belonging  to ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to  Emerging  the  knowledge  of  Trans-lineage (***gotrabhuñāṇa***) arises contiguously. Due to presence of performing as the function of advertence of the Noble Path, that knowledge of Trans-lineage does not belongs to ***paṭipadāñāṇa***  ***dassana  visuddhi***.  Furthermore  it  does  not  take  the  object  of ***saṅkhāradhamma***  by  means  of  those  phenomena,  impermanence  etc.  Due  to incapable of eradicating defilements though the knowledge of Trans-lineage has the ability to take the object of ***nibbāna***, it does not belongs to ***ñāṇadassanaa visuddhi***. Due  to  capable  of  adverting  towards  ***nibbāna***  for  the  Noble  Path  though  the knowledge of Trans lineage is unable to eradicate defilement as the indifferent mind element five doors advertence (***pañca dvāra vajjana***) which is capable of adverting any  kind  of  objects  of  five  doors  (***pañcāramma***ṇ***a***),  visible  object  etc,  for  five consciousness element (***pañcāviññāṇa*** ***dhātu***)\_\_\_\_\_\_ it can be said the knowledge of Trans-lineage stands at the place of advertence of the Noble Path. It lies between two kinds of purification, ***paṭipadāñāṇadassna visuddhi*** and ***ñāṇadassanavisuddhi*** but lacks characters of those two kinds of purification. Due to this reason it is not worth designating as which kind of purification in the aspect of terminology. However due to  falling  progression  of  ***vipassanā***  (***vipassnasota***)  as  the  end  of  ***Vipassanā***   = ***vuṭṭhāna gāmini vipassanā***. (With regarding to this word, it shows the Knowledge of Trans-lineage falls ***paṭipadāñāṇa*** ***dassana visuddhi***).(***Vs-2-312,Mah***āṭī ***-2-483***) 

The knowledge associating with these Four kinds of Noble Path, called the Path (-moment) of Upstream enterer, the path (moment) of Once returnee, the Path (- moment)  of  Non-returnee,  the  Path  (-moment)  of  Arahant  is  designated  as  the purification of path knowledge (***ñāṇadassnan visuddhi***) . 

Among those Four kinds of Noble Path, previously the practising meditator who wants to fulfil the first Path Knowledge, has not any other function. It is right. The obligatory function of that practising meditator has been finished so as to arise ***vipassanā*** knowledge with the peak called the knowledge of Adaptation. If had been performed. (***Vs-2-312***) 

**To be noticed**\_\_\_\_\_ This stage is a period while ***vipassanā*** practiec is being performed  by  taking  the  object  of  only  perishing  stage  of  ***sankāra***  ***dhamma***s (conditioned  things)  and  having  reasoned  inductively  as  three  general  characters alternatively,  especially  general  character  of  non-self  (***anatta***).  In  this  stage  if  the ***meditator*** is the person with pure ***vipassanā*** vehicle (***suddhavipassanyānika***) and he had finished to discern miscellaneous ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas*** of all kinds, he should like to discern only mental ***dhamma***s of cognizable objects line within wholesome group especially. Sometimes ***vipassanā*** practice must be performed by alternative discerning on those mental ***dhammas*** and depended bases of those mental ***dhammas***. Sometimes it  must  be  carried  out  corporeality  and  mentality,  internally  and  externally alternatively. Sometimes three general characters must be discerned in order or the most  favorable  one  must  be  emphasized  continuously.  Sometimes,  the  discerning ***vipassanā*** knowledge must be discerned as the object of ***vipassanā*** practice. 

If the practising ***meditator*** is the person with ***samatha*** vehicle (***samathayānika***) ***vipassanā*** practice must be performed by alternative discerning on mental ***dhammas*** of acquired absorption, 

**PAGE-464** 

and  depended  bases  of  mental  ***dhammas***  of  those  absorptions  internally  and externally. Among three general characters it must be discerned one after another or the most favourable one must be emphasized continuously. It can be emphasized and discerned on the most favorable absorption and general character as he likes. During discerning sometimes, the discerning ***vipassanā*** knowledge (= continuity of mental ***dhammas*** of impulsions of mind-door cognitive process with ***vipassanā*** knowledge) must be discerned as the object of ***vipassanā*** practice. 

For  those  two  kinds  of  ***vipassanā***  practice,  ***kālapasmmasana***  method  and ***anupāda dhamma*** ***vipassanā*** method, the preferable one can be performed as he likes. If  the  consciousness  of  ***vipassanā***  practice  is  firmly  fixed  on  the  object  of internal ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhamma***s while the former is discerning on the latter, it must be continued to discern on those internal ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas***. If the consciousness of 

***vipassanā*** practice is firmly fixed on the object of external ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas,*** while the former is discerning on the latter, it must be continued to discern on those external ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas***. At that time if alternative discerning on internal and external ones  are  carried  on  the  controlling  faculty  of  concentration  will  be  diminished resulting in diminished nature of neutrality towards ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas***. 

Furthermore,  while  ***saṅkhāra***  ***dhammas***  are  being  discerned  as  ***anicca***  (= impermanence),  if  the  consciousness  of  ***vipassanā***  practice  becomes  stable  on  the object of those ***sankkaradhamma***s, it must be continued to discern on those ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas.*** While ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas*** are being discerned as ***dukkha*** (= suffering), if the  consciousness  of  ***vipassanā***  practice  becomes  stable  on  the  object  of  those ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhamma***s, it must be continued to discern on those ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhamma***s and so forth. It is carried on the same object so that the controlling faculty of concentration and the nature of neutrality towards ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas*** will not be diminished. 

The consciousness of ***vipassanā*** practice, which is firmly fixed on the any kind of phenomena, i.e., ***anicca*** or ***dukkha*** or ***anatta***, of ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhamma*** is the mind with  completely  matured  controlling  faculties,  firm  faith,  effort,  mindfulness, concentration wisdom. In order that those controlling faculties associating with that consciousness  of  ***vipassanā***  practice  become  more  and  more  matured,  ***vipassanā*** practice must be continued to perform by taking the object of perishing phenomenon of  corporeal  or  mental  ***saṅkhāra***  ***dhammas***  and  discerning  as  the  same  general character, ***anicca*** or ***dukkha*** or ***anatta*** repeatedly. If the discerning consciousness of ***vipassanā***  practice  has  got  five  kinds  of  harmonious,  matured,  sharp,  brave  and purified  controlling  faculties,  ***Vipasanā***  Knowledge,  with  the  peak  called  the knowledge  of  Adaptation  will  arise  consequently.  The  obligatory  function  of practising ***meditator*** has been finished so as to arise ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge the peak called the Knowledge of Adaptation. 

Due  to  finishing  obligatory  function  in  that  way,  in  the  continuum  of  that practising ***meditator***, two or three times of the Knowledge of Adaptation arise. Among those  kinds  of  knowledge,  the  firsts  knowledge  of  Adaptation  =  ***parikamma*** (preliminary  work)  can  remove  gross  darkness  of  delusion,  which  is  capable  of concealing on the 

**PAGE-465** 

Four Noble Truths while the second one = ***upacāra*** (access) can remove middle gross darkness of delusion, which is also capable of concealing on the Four Noble Truths, the  third  one  =  ***anuloma***  (adaptation),  subtle  darkness  of  delusion,  which  is  also capable  of  concealing  on  the  Four  Noble  Truths.  In  other  words,  those  kinds  of knowledge conform the efficacy that is supported by habitual recurrence of lower Knowledge  Towards  Formations  resulting  in  removing  gross  and  subtle  kinds  of darkness of delusion which are capable of concealing on the Four Noble Truths. When those are removed in that way the consciousness of that practising ***meditator*** does not enter, stand, take into heart, adhere, entangle, concern with ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhamma***s. It recoils, shrinks and revolves as a drop of water on surface of a little bent leaf of lotus. 

Due to occurrence of finishing to remove the darkness of delusion, which is capable of concealing on impediment (***palibodha***), both the object of all kinds of ***saṅkhāra*** ***nimitta***, including ***ñata*** and ***ñāṇa***, which are called objects of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge and  the object called continuous processes of ***upādinnaka*** aggregates, appear as impediment. After all kinds of objects called ***nimitta***, ***pavaṭṭa*** appeared as impediment for that practising ***yogavacāra*** person (= ***meditator***), at the end of the second or third Knowledge of Adaptation which is accepted by efficiency of habitual recurrence  (***āsevana***)  of  previous  mind  moment,  the  Knowledge  of  Trans-lineage (***gotrabhu***), which is benefited by efficiency of habitual recurrence of those second or third Knowledge of Adaptation, which revolves, takes into heart, bears in mind the object of ***nibbāna*** previously, which does not revolve again, due to both occurrence  of reaching to the end and peak of ***vipassanā***  and occurrence of only once, arises  

1) by taking the object of ***nibbāna***,  
1. which is void and opposite of phenomena of conditioned things (***animitta***). 
1. which  is  void  and  opposite  of  the  cyclic  ***dhamma***  that  is  capable  of occurring  continuous  processes  of  corporeality,  feeling,  perception, ***kamma***-formation, consciousness (***apavaṭṭa)*** 
1. which is not conditioned things (***visaṅkhāra***) 
1. which is the cessation of conditioned things (***nirodha***) 
2) by surpassing the lineage of worldling the terminology of worldling, the sphere of worldling, 
2) by including the lineage of the Noble-Ones (**ariya**); 
2) by finishing benefiting for the First Path Knowledge by means of six kinds of relations,  viz,  contiguity  (***anatara***),  immediate  contiguity  (***samanantara***), habitual  recurrence  (***āsevana***),  determinative  dependence  (***upanissaya***)  , absence (***natthi***), disappearance (***vigata***). 

For those two kinds of Knowledge, the 'Adaptation' and 'the Trans-lineage, the former is capable of removing only darkness of defilement, which conceals on the Four Noble Truths, but unable to take the object of ***nibbāna***. The latter, indeed, is capable  of  taking  the  object  of  ***nibbāna***  only,  but  unable  to  remove  darkness  of defilement  which  conceals  on  the  Four  Noble  Truths.  Due  to  incapability  of Knowledge  of  Trans-lineage,  that  Knowledge  is  worth  designating  as  advertence (***āvajjana***). It is right. \_\_\_\_\_ The Knowledge of Trans-lineage , without taking the same object of ***saṅkhāradhammas***, the  Knowledge of Adaptation, performs not to reappear  that  'Adaptation'  again  and  stands  in  for  advertence  though  itself  is  not advertence and pass away after functioning as if it gives the symbol that "try to arise by taking the object of ***nibbāna*** in this way. 

**PAGE-466** 

The Noble Path, without refusing the symbol given by that Knowledge of Trans- lineage, arises contiguously by penetrating bulks of selfish desire, anger and delusion, which had never been penetrated in previous infinite rounds of rebirth. (***Visuddhi-2- 313, 314***) 

That Noble Path not only performs mere penetrating to bulks of selfish desire etc, but also dries up the water of ocean called the suffering of rounds of rebirth with  unrealizable  beginning,  which  will  occur  in  future  from  coming  first  existence. Furthermore,  it  shuts  the  doors  of  all  kinds  of  woeful  existences,  it  performs 

fulfillment of seven kinds of wealth of gentleman, viz, faith, virtue, shame, dread, general  knowledge,  charity,  wisdom,  in  recent;  it  abandons  Wrong  Path  (***micchā*** ***magga***) with eight kinds of factors, wrong view (***micchā*** ***diṭṭhi***) etc.; it extinguishes five  kinds of danger, killing being (***panātipāta***) etc., and (25) kinds of disaster; it carries real heir and heiress of the Supreme Enlightened Buddha with the Knowledge of Omniscience. Moreover it can give rise to plenty of advantages, firm faith in Triple Games called ***Buddha***, ***dhamma***, ***sangha***, etc. In this way the Knowledge associating with the Path of Upstream-enterer, which can give rise to plenty of advantages, is designated as the Path-Knowledge of Upstream-enterer. (***Vs-2-314, 315***). 

**9.1.2 Upstream-enterer person (*sotāpanna puggala*)** 

Just after this Path - Knowledge of Upstream-enterer, either two or three times of Consciousness of Fruition (***phala citta***), which are consequent of that consciousness of Path of Upstream- enterer, arise contiguously. It is right. \_\_\_\_\_ Due to presence of giving  rise  to  resultant  ***dhamma***  contiguously  after  it  had  occurred,  the  Buddha preached as both, “***Samadhimānantarikaññamāhu***” (***khu-1-5***), = “the all ***Buddhas*** always preach that the noble concentration ***dhamma*** associating with that Noble Path is  able  to  give  rise  to  resultant  ***dhamma***  called  the  Noble  Fruit  contiguously  and certainly”, and  

“***dandham anantarikan pāpunāti*** ***āsavānam khayāya***". (***Ang-1-467***). 

- “In order that all cankers (***āsava dhamma***) will  be finished it will reaches 

into  the  Noble  Path,  which  has  the  contiguous  consequence,  the  Noble  Fruit (***ariyaphala***)”. (***Vs-2-315***). 

Some teachers of another thought of school said that once, two, three or four times of consciousness of Fruition can occur. The words of those teacher are  not worth  accepting.  This  is  because  just  after  the  Knowledge  of  Adaptation,   which obtains  the  supporting  of  relation  of  habitual  recurrence,  has  passed  away,  the Knowledge  of  Trans-lineage  arises  contiguously.  Therefore  at  least  two  times  of consciousness of 'Adaptation' deserves to arise as minimum rate. It is right.  

**PAGE-467** 

Only once time of Adaptation can not obtain the supporting of relation of habitual recurrence. Then a cognitive process with one advertence consists of seven times of mind moments. It means that impulsions can occur a maximum of six or seven times. Therefore in the continuum of such practising ***meditator***, if two times of Adaptation occur, the third impulsion Trans-lineage will occur in the continuum of that person. The fourth one, the consciousness of Noble path will arise and then three times of consciousness of Noble Fruition will arise successively. (***Vs-2-315***) 

In the  continuum  of such practising ***meditator*** if three times of Adaptation occur, the fourth impulsion, Trans-lineage, the fifth one, the consciousness of Noble  Path; two times of consciousness of Noble Fruition will arise successively. Therefore the word, "two or three times of consciousness of Noble Fruition will arise", should be said appropriately. (***Vs-2-315***). 

On the other hand, those teachers of another thought of school said that in the continuum of such practising ***meditator*** if four times of Adaptation occur, the fifth impulsion, Trans-lineage, the six one, the consciousness of Noble Path; only one, consciousness of Noble Fruition will occur in the continuum of that person. The words of those teachers are not worth believing as an essence. It is because either fourth time or fifth time of impulsion is able to occur by means of full absorption (***appan***ā), but more than fifth time is unable to occur by means of full absorption resulting from occurrence of quite adjacent to the life continuum. It deserves to reject and ideology of teachers of other thought of school (***kecivāda***), therefore, it is not worth believing. (***Vs-2-315***) 

Only when the Noble Fruition occurs contiguously after the first Noble Path with so far as this extent, this practising ***meditator*** becomes the second Noble One called the Upstream-enterer (***sotāpanna***). Although he is full of forgetfulness due to reaching  into  status  of  forgetfulness,  kinghood  of  heavenly  beings,  kinghood  of ***chakkavatin*** (= sovereign of the four islands of the universe) etc, he is able to perform the end of suffering after running seven times of both existences of heavenly beings and human beings alternatively. At the end of Noble Fruition, the consciousness of that practising ***meditator*** falls into life continuum. Afterwards, due to interruption of life continuum, the mind door advertence arises in order to reflect the Noble Path. After ceasing of that advertence seven times of impulsions, which reflects the Noble path, arise successively. This is the cognitive process of reflecting (paccavekkhana vithi), which reflects the Noble path. Then, after falling into life continuum, the next advertence etc, arises in order to reflect the Noble Fruition etc in that way. Due to occurrence of those advertence and consciousness of impulsion, it can be said the Upstream enterer....... 

1. reflects the Path, 
1. reflects the Fruition, 
1. reflects defilements that had been eradicated, 
1. reflects remaining defilements that has not been eradicated yet, 
1. reflects ***nibbāna***. 

That person reflects the path as "I came through this path." Afterwards the Fruition  is  reflected  as  "I  am  worth  getting  this  remarkable  benefit."  Afterwards defilements that had been eradicated are reflected as" I have finished to eradicate these kinds of defilements." Afterwards, those defilements, which should be 

**PAGE-468** 

eradicated by the Upper Three Noble Paths, are related as " I have still remain these kinds of defilements." Finally, the deathless state of ***nibbāna***, where there is no more rebirth or re-death, is reflected as" I have realized this ***dhamma*** by taking it as object." Thus in the continuum of the Noble Disciple who is the Upstream enterer, five times of reflecting cognitive processes arise consecutively. Similarly five times of reflecting cognitive processes arise in each continuum of the once returnee and Non-returnee respectively.  Especially  it  should  be  recognized  that  there  is  no  reflecting  on remaining defilements to be eradicated for Arahant. (It means that in the continuum of an Arahant four kinds of reflecting cognitive processes can raise.) Thus there are (19) kinds of reflecting cognitive processes totally. (***Vs-2-315,316***) 

Revealing in this way is the method showing maximum of limitation indeed. It is  right  .Reflecting  on  defilements  that  had  been  eradicated  and  reflecting  on defilements that has not been eradicated yet, can or can not be carried out for the lower Three Noble Ones who has not yet attained Arahantship (***sekkha***). It is right. The capability to reflect defilements that had been eradicated and remaining ones can be    carried out by some dower Three Noble Ones but not by some lower Three Noble Ones.  Due  to  this  reason,  the  prince  ***Mahānama***  asked  the  Supreme  Buddha  that "Supreme Buddha.... due to presence of such defilements that has not been eradicated yet, sometimes the selfish desire also causes to stand my finished consciousness of wholesome deeds, sometimes the anger also causes to stand it; sometimes the delusion also  causes  to  stand  it,  which  kinds  of  defilements  are  those  still  remains  to  be eradicated in the internal continuum of mine? (***M-1-126***) It should be understood on this entire sutta in detailed. (***Vs -2-316***) 

In  the  commentary  of  ***C***ūļ***a  dukkhakkhandha  Sutta,  Mūlapaññāsa***,  it  is explained as follows.\_\_\_\_\_ 

***Pali Quotation (M-A-1- 366)*** 

Those kinds of relecting cognitive processes are not carried out completely and certainly for all Noble Ones. One kind of Noble Ones reflects only defilements that had been eradicated, while one kind of Noble one reflects only remaining defilements to be eradicated, one kind of Noble Ones, the Noble Path only, one kind of Noble ones, the Noble Fruition only, one kind of Noble ones, ***nibbāna*** only. Among these five  kinds  of  reflecting  cognitive  processes,  either  one  kind  or  two  kinds  can  be carried out appropriately. Thus as if such person can not fulfil five kinds of reflecting cognitive processes, it will be resulting from absence of cleverness in terminology of defilements eradicated by each Noble Path for that person. (***M-A-1-366***) 

According  to  above  commentary,  among  five  kinds  of  reflecting  cognitive processes either any one kind or two kinds must be carried out certainly. 

**PAGE-469** 

` `However it never says definitely on which kind. With regarding to the words, " it will be resulting from absence of cleverness in terminology of defilements eradicated by each Noble Path, it can be concluded that those kinds of reflecting on defilements that had been eradicated or not yet ones, can not be carried out generally but those three kinds of reflecting on the Path, the Fruition, and ***nibbāna*** can be carried out certainly. 

2. **Stage of Second Path-Knowledge** 

Then that Noble Disciple who became as the Upstream enterer after reflecting in this way, endeavours in order that both strong sensual desire, ill will, will be scarce and the Second Fruition called Fruition of Once-returnee will be reached by sitting on that same place or by staying in any other place appropriately. After performing to mature those controlling faculties, strength, factors of enlightenment that person bears in  mind  all  kinds  of  ***saṅkhāra***  ***dhammas***,  viz,  corporeality,  feeling,  perception, ***kamma-***formation, consciousness, over and over again by means of scrutinizing and discerning as ***anicca, dukkha, anatta. Vipassanā*** Knowledge has been occurred over and over again resulting in falling in the continuity of ***vipassanā*** practice. For that Upstream  enterer  person  who  is  practising  through  the  way  mentioned  above, prerivously the knowledge of Arising and Passing Away occurs as mentioned above and then at the end of Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations later, when the Knowledge of Adaptation and the Knowledge of Trans-lineage in the next method, the Knowledge of Adaptation and the Knowledge of Purity (***vodāna***) occur successively through one mind door advertence, the path of once returnee arises contiguously after the Knowledge of Purity which is similarly to the Knowledge of Trans-lineage. The Knowledge  associating  with  that  Path  of  Once-returnee  is  designated  as  the  Path Knowledge  of  Once-returnee.  After  this  Path  Knowledge  of  Once  returnee,  those contiguous times occurring consciousness of Fruition should be recognized similar to mentioned above. So far as this extent this practising Noble One becomes the Fourth Noble  One  called  the  Once-returnee  (***sakadāgām***ī)  who  returns  only  once  for  the process of NONE in this sensual world and he is able to achieve the end of suffering of rounds of rebirth. After reaching to the Fruition of Once-returnee, those reflecting cognitive processes arise similar to mentioned above. (***Vs -2-316,317***) 

**2.9.1 Scarcity of defilements** 

How  the  scarcity  and  weakness  of  those  strong  and  rough  sensual  sensual desire and ill will can be known is that\_\_\_\_\_ 

“by means of these two kinds of situations,  

1. either infrequent occurrence in sometimes or  
1. the  occurrence  of  less  strong  and  weak  nature  of  over  exertion 

(***pariyuṭṭhāna***)  which  arise  as  three  time  phases,  ***uppāda-ṭhiti-bhanga***,  in  the continuity  of  mind,  it  can  be  known  in  this  way.  Although  various  kinds  of defilements arise continuously in the continuum of common peoples who always walk along  with  rounds  of  rebirth,  defilements  never  arise  continuously  for  the  once returnee person. 

**PAGE-470** 

` `Sometimes  they  arise  discontinuously  and  infrequently.  Although  they  arise discontinuously  and  infrequently  some  times,  they  never  arise  randomly  by suppressing  concealing  making  cloud  of  darkness.  Actually  due  to  occurrence  of finishing to remove by two kinds of Path the Path of Upstream-enterer and the Path of Once-returnee,  they  arise  with  very  subtle  and  scarce  condition.  It  should  be recognized on the nature of scarcity of defilements by observing on these conditions. (***Mahāṭī-2-487***) 

**Trans-lineage (*gotrabhu*)\_\_\_\_\_** 

` `Due  to  ability  to  both  suppress  the  lineage  of  worldling  and  improve  the lineage of Noble One, the knowledge, which arises before the Path Knowledge of Upstream-enterer, should be designated as ***gotrabhu*** (= Trans-lineage) directly. The knowledge which arises before the Path Knowledge of Once-returnee on the other hand,  should  be  designated  as  ***gotrabhu***  indirectly  and  metaphorically  (= ***sadisūpacāra***)  due  to  similar  to  that  real  ***gotrabhu***.  The  reason  why  it  should  be designated as" purity (***vodāna***)" is that both due to presence of purification without some  impurities  (***samkilesa***)  and  due  to  taking  the  object  of  extremely  purified ***nibbāna*** as object. Therefore in the Pali Text of ***Paṭṭhāna*** (conditional relations) it is preached as follows:\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

***anulomam vodānassa anantarapaccayena paccayo.(Abhi-1-138)*** 

The knowledge of Adaptation benefits the knowledge of purity by efficiency of relation of contiguity ***(anantara paccaya). (Abhi-1-138)*** 

As if the term, the "purity" is a designation as directly, the reason why the commentary of ***Visuddhi Magga*** explained as “***gotrabhuanantaram*** =  contiguously after  Trans-lineage”,  without  explaining  as  “***vodānantaram***  =  contiguously  after purity, " is that it explained by following the course of Pali Text called ***Paṭisambhidā 

***Magga***. 

In the Pali Text called ***Paṭisambhidā*** ***Magga***, pp 65, in these phrases depending upon the meaning of predominance, ***uppāda*** (= arising ) etc, " eight kinds of Trans- lineage ***dhammas*** arise by means of ***vipassanā*** practice," etc,\_\_\_\_\_ those names of knowledge before the Path Knowledge of Once-returnee etc, are designated as the term,  Trans-lineage  (***gotrabhu***).  Therefore  it  is  also  explained  as “***gotrabhuanantaram*** = contiguously after Trans-lineage", in this commentary called ***Visuddhi Magga***. (***Mahāṭī-2-487, 488***) 

**9.2.2 The Once returnee person (*sakadāgām***ī**)** 

The statement in above explanation of commentary of ***Visuddhi Magga***, "the fourth Noble One who returns only once for the process of NONE in this sensual world and he is able to achieve the end of suffering of rounds of rebirth is called the Once  returnee,"  is  presumed  only  one  kind  among  five  kinds  of  Once-  returnee, excluding four kinds of remaining ones. 

1. Some persons get complete extinction of ***khandha*** life (***parinibbāna***) in this 

human existence after attaining the Fruition of Once-returnee in this human existence. 

2. Some persons get complete extinction of ***khandha*** life in heavenly existence 

after attaining the Fruition of Once-returnee in this human existence. 

**PAGE-471** 

3. Some  persons  get  complete  extinction  of  ***khandha***  life  in  that  heavenly 

existence. After attaining the Fruition of Once-returnee in heavenly existence, some persons get complete extinction of ***khandha*** life in that heavenly existence. 

4. After attaining the Fruition of Once-returnee in heavenly existence, some 

persons get complete extinction of ***khandha*** life in this human existence, by taking the process of NONE (***paṭisamdhi***) again. 

Without presuming these four kinds of persons it should be recogniged the fact that the commentary of ***Visudhi Magga*** explained by presuming this kind only,  

5. "after attaining the Fruition of Once-returnee in this human existence then 

the process of NONE (***paṭisamdhi***) occurs in heavenly existence and lives for through out that existence, afterwards such person gets the process of NONE again in this human  existence  and  gets  complete  extinction  of  khandha  life  in  this  human existence." (***Mah***āṭī ***-2- 488***)  

3. **Stage of Third Path Knowledge**  

That Noble Disciple who became as the Once-returnee, after reflecting on the Path Fruition, ***nibbāna*** etc, performs strenuously ***vipassanā*** practice over and over again, in order that both scarce subtle fetter of sensual desire and fetter of repulsion (***paṭigha samyojana***) will be eradicated totally and the Third Fruition called Fruition of Non returnee will be reached by sitting on that same place or by staying in any other  place  appropriately.  After  performing  to  mature  those  controlling  faculties, strength, factors of enlightenment that person bears in mind and kneads all kinds of ***saṅkhāra***  ***dhammas***  occurring  in  three  realms,  over  and  over  again  by  means  of scrutinizing  and  discerning  as  ***anicca,  dukkha,  anatta***.  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  has been occurred over and over again resulting, in falling in the continuity of ***vipassanā*** practice.  It  means  the  performance  for  the  successive  occurrence  of  ***Vipassanā*** Knowlege from the knowledge of Arising and Passing Away to the end of Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations. For that Once-returnee person who is practising through the way mentioned above, at the end of Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations, when the knowledge of Adaptation and the Knowledge of Trans-lineage (= purity, ***vodāna***) occur successively through one mind door advertence, the path of Non  returnee  arises  contiguously  adjacent  to  the  Knowledge  of  Trans-lineage  (= purity,  ***vodāna***).  The  knowledge  associating  with  that  path  of  Non  returnee  is designated as the Path Knowledge of Non returnee. (***Vs-2-314***) 

After this Path Knowledge of Non returnee those contiguous times occurring consciousness of Fruition should be recognized similar to mentioned above. So far as this extent this practising Noble One becomes the sixth Noble One called the Non returnee (***anāgāmi***) who never returns for the process of NONE in this sensual World, who is able to reborn without visible cause (i.e. Without parents) in the Realm of Pure Abode (***suddhāvāsa***) and who usually gets complete extinction of ***khandha*** life in that realm.  After  reaching  to  the  fruition  of  Non  returnee,  those  reflecting  cognitive processes arise similar to mentioned above. (***Vs -2-317***) 

By means of process of NONE (***paṭisandhi***) only it is the nature of never return from that ***bramah*** world. In order to pay respect the Supreme Buddha and to listen the Noble preaching those heavenly beings usually return of the sensual 

**PAGE-472** 

world including this human world. They come back the sensual world in order to preach ***dhamma*** in ***sudhammā*** congregation hall as a ***bramah*** called ***Sanankumāra***. (***Mahāṭī-2-488, 489***) 

4. **Fourth Path and Fruition (*arahatta maggaphala*)** 

That Noble Disciple who became as the Non-returnee, after reflecting on the path, Fruition, ***nibbāna*** etc in this way, performs strenuously ***vipassanā*** practice over and  over  again  in  order  that  both  five  fetters  belonging  to  the  upper  part (***uddhānbhagiya samyojana***) viz, desire to fine material sphere (***rūparāga***) desire to immaterial sphere (***a-rūparāga***), conceit (***māna***), unrest (***uddhacca***), ignorance, will be eradicated totally and the Fourth Fruition called Fruition of Arahant will be reached by sitting on that same place or by staying in any other place appropriately. After performing to mature those controlling faculties, strength, factors of enlightenment, that person bears in mind and kneads all kinds of ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhamma***s occurring in three realms, over and over again bay means of scrutinizing and discerning as ***anicca, dukkha,  anatta***.  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  has  been  occurred  over  and  over  again resulting in falling in the continuity of ***vipassanā*** practice. It means the performance for successive occurrence of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge from the knowledge of Arising and Passing Away to the end of Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations. For that Non returnee who is practising through the way mentioned above at the end of knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations, when the Knowledge of Adaptation and the Knowledge of Trans-lineage (purity, ***vodāna***) occur successively through one mind  door  advertence,  the  Path  of  Arahant  arises  contiguously  adjacent  to  the knowledge of Trans lineage (= purity, ***vodāna***). The knowledge associating with that Path of Arahant is designated as the path knowledge of Arahant. (***Vs-2-317,318***) 

After  this  Path  Knowledge  of  Arahant,  those  contiguous  times  occurring Consciousness of Fruition should be recognized similar to mentioned above. So for as this extent this fulfilled Noble One becomes the Eight Noble One called Arahant. An Arahant is peak of Noble One among eight kinds of Noble Disciples, who is 

1. ***mahākh***īṇā***savā*** = great powerful person without any kind of cankers (***āsava***) and worth worshipping, 
1. ***antima dehadhārī*** = capable carrying final burden of body, 
1. ***ohitabhāra***  =  having  burden  of  body,  burden  of  defilements,  burden  of accumulation of ***kamma***, merit or demerit (***abhisaṅkhāra***) which had been put down well,  
1. ***anuppattasadattha*** = having remarkable benefit called fruition of Arahant which has been attained in order, 
1. ***parikkh***īṇā***bhavasamyojana*** = having (10) kinds of finished fetters of existence, 
1. ***sammā*** ***daññavimutta*** = especially delivered from defilements after knowing on the nature of aggregates (***khandha***) etc, 
1. ***aggadakkhineyya***  =  worth  accepting  noble  devotional  offering  of  all  beings including heavenly beings. 

These kinds of knowledge which are associating with Four kinds of Noble Path mentioned in this way are known as the purification of path knowledge (***ñāṇadassana visuddhi***). 

**PAGE-473 9.4 Four kinds of application of mindfulness (*satipaṭṭhāna*) has been fulfilled** 

It  has  been  presented  in  detail  up  to  section  of  elaborate  discerning  of  the knowledge of Arising and Passing Away including, 

1. with regarding to “***samudayadhammanupassī***”, way of discerning on the nature of arising (***samudaya***), 
2. with  regarding  to  "***vayadhammanupassī***",  way  of  discerning  on  the  nature  of decaying (***vaya***), and  
3. with regarding to "***sarmudaya vayadhammanupassī***", way of discerning on the nature of arising decaying (***samudayavaya***). 

In later Sections after that way of elaborate discerning of the knowledge of Arising  and  Passing  Away,  those  cascade  ways  of  discerning  which  has  been presented from the section of matured knowledge of Arising and Passing Away which frees  from  defilements  to  this  Fruition  of  Arahant  are  only  the  elaborate  way  of discerning  found  in  the  following  preaching  of  ***saṭipaṭṭhāna***  (application  of mindfulness).

1. Furthermore, in the continuum of that *bhikkhu*, the mindfulness appears as “a mere all bodily constituents is present." 

That mindfulness is only factor of improvement of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge which is capable of discerning on “all bodily constituents” over and over again. It is only factor  of  improvement  of  successive  mindfulness  associating  with  ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge  which  is  capable  of  keeping  in  mind  all  bodily  constituents.  That *bhikkhu* stays without living by means of craving-wrong view. He never obsess any kind of ***dhamma*** any kind of desirable things in the world which are called fivefold  clinging  to  aggregates  (***pañcupādana-  khandha***)  as  "I,  mine". *Bhikkhus*..... thus the *bhikkhu* usually stays by discerning on all bodily constituents over and over again. (***M-1-71***) 

2. with  regarding  to  “***vayadhammānupassī***”,  way  of  discerning  on  the  nature  of decaying (***vaya***), and 
3. with  regarding  to  “***samudayavayadhammānupassī***”,  way  of  discerning  on  the nature of arising-decaying (***samudaya-vaya***).  

In later Sections after that way of elaborate discerning of the Knowledge of Arising  and  Passing  Away,  those  cascade  ways  of  discerning,  which  has  been presented  from  the  Section  of  matured  Knowledge  of  Arising  and  Passing  Away which frees from defilements to this Fruition of Arahant, are only the elaborate way of discerning  found  in  the  following  preaching  of  ***Saṭipaṭṭhana***  (application  of mindfulness).

That mindfulness is only factor of improvement of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge which is capable of discerning on “all bodily constituents” over and over again. It is only factor  of  improvement  of  successive  mindfulness  associating  with  ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge which is capable of keeping in mind “all bodily constituents”.

(***M-1-71***) 

2. Furthermore, in the continuum of that *bhikkhu*, the mindfulness appears as “a mere feeling”. 

That mindfulness is only factor of improvement of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge which is capable  of  discerning  on  “feeling”  over  and  over  again.  It  is  only  factor  of improvement of successive mindfulness associating with ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge which is capable of keeping in mind “feeling”.

(***M-1-75,76***) 

3. Furthermore, in the continuum of that *bhikkhu*, the mindfulness appears as “a mere consciousness”. 

That mindfulness is only factor of improvement of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge which is capable of discerning on “consciousness” over and over again. It is only factor of improvement of successive mindfulness associating with ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge which is capable of keeping in mind “consciousness”. That *bhikkhu* stays without living by means of craving-wrong view.

(***M-1-71***) 

6. **Thirty  seven  qualities  of  associating  *dhamma*s  of  enlightenment (*bodhipakkhiya* *dhamma*s)** 

Due to presence of ability to realize Four Noble Truths, due to occurrence of association  with  the  Noble  Path  which  is  worth  designating  as  ***bodha***  (= enlightenment),  due  to  occurrence  of  standing  as  beneficial  associates,  these  (37) kinds of ***dhammas*** viz, four kinds of application of mindfulness (***satipaṭṭhāna***)  four kinds  of  strenuous  effort  (***sammappadhāna***),  four  kinds  of  psychic  powers (***iddhipāda***) five kinds of controlling faculties, (***indriya***), five kinds of strength (***bala***), seven kinds of constituents of knowledge (***bojjhanga***), eight kinds of purified factors of Noble Path (***ariya magganga***), are designated as "***bodhipakkhiya dhamma***" ( = associating ***dhammas*** of enlightenment). 

1. **Four kinds of application of mindfulness (*satipaṭṭhana*)** 

Among  those  qualities  of  associating  ***dhamma***s  of  enlightenment,  the mindfulness(***sati***), itself, is called ***satipaṭṭhana*** due to occurrence of ability to stand on objects of bodily constituents, feeling, consciousness, principle of ***dhamma***, by means taking the object as the nature of repulsiveness (***asubha***), the nature of impermanence (***anicca***), the nature of suffering (***dukkha***), the nature of non self (***anatta***) (= by means of performing the function which rejects perception of desirability (***subha***), perception of permanence (***nicca***), perception of happiness (***sukha***) perception of self (***atta***). 

Qualities of associating ***dhammas*** of enlightenment are available in various kinds of consciousness during occurring of mundane ***vipassanā*** knowldge before the Noble Path. The way of availability is as follows. 

For  the  ***meditator***  who  discerns  and  keeps  in  mind  bodily  constituents (***rūpakāya***) bay these 14 modes, viz, 

1. ***ānāpānapabba*** = section of developing mindfulness of breathing  
1. ***iriyāpathapabba*** = section of discerning on deportment  
1. ***sampajaññapabba*** = section of discerning on clear comprehension 
1. ***paṭikūla  manasīkārapabba***  =  section  of  discerning  on  the  nature  of 

repulsiveness (loathsomeness)  

**PAGE-475** 

5. ***dhātumanasīkārapabba*** = section of taking into heart the nature of elements  6-14 ***navasivathikapabba*** = section of contemplation of nine kinds of corpses, 

14 sections of contemplation of the bodily constituents (***kāyanupassanā*** ***satipaṭṭhāna***) is available. 

Among  those  sections,  section  of  developing  mindfulness  of  breathing (***ānāpānapabba***) etc, if ***vipassanā*** practice has been performed by this cascade of ways,  firstly  concentration  is  developed  and  that  concentration  is  applied  as  the fundamental of ***vipassanā*** practice, secondly corporeality and mentality are kept in mind through the former corporeality; as priority after wards causal ***dhammas*** of those corporeality  and  mentality  are  scrutinized;  and  thirdly,  those  conditioned  things (***sankkhāra*** ***dhamma***) called corporeality and mentality with causal ***dhammas*** which are occurring in both three periods and two continuums, i.e., internal and external, are discerned,  are  discerned  as  three  general  characters,  ***anicca,  dukkha,  anatta***,  it  is designated as ***kāyānupassanā*** ***satipaṭṭhāna*** (contemplation of the bodily constituents) due to priority of corporeality to be discerned. \_\_\_\_\_ (1) 

For the ***meditator*** who keeps in mind “feeling” through (9) kinds of modes , contemplation of the feeling (***vedanānupassan***ā) is available. During keeping in mind mental ***dhammas***, the feeling as priority together with associating mental ***dhammas*** are kept in mind simultaneously. After keeping in mind mentality object-corporeality and depended base corporeality of those mental ***dhammas*** must be kept in mind again. If ***vipassanā*** practice has been performed by this cascade of processes as shown in this way, it is designated as ***vedanānupasnā*** ***satipaṭṭhanā*** (contemplation of the feeling). \_\_\_\_\_ (2) 

For the ***meditator*** who keeps in mind “consciousness” through (16) kinds of modes,  contemplation  of  the  consciousness  (***cittānupassanā***  ***satipaṭṭhāna***)  is available. During keeping in mind mental ***dhammas***, the consciousness as priority, together with associating mental ***dhammas*** are kept in mind simultaneously. After keeping in mind mentality object-corporeality and depended base corporeality of those mental  ***dhammas***  must  be  kept  in  mind  again.  If  ***vipassanā***  practice  has  been performed  by  this  cascade  of  processes  as  shown  in this  way,  it  is  designated  as ***cittānupassanā*** ***satipaṭṭhāna*** (contemplation of the consciousness). \_\_\_\_\_ (3) 

For the ***meditator*** who keeps in mind conditioned things (***saṅkhāra*** ***dhamma***) called corporeal and mental ***dhammas*** through these five kinds of modes, 

1. ***nīvara***ṇ***apabba***=  section  of  discerning  on  hindrances  as  priority  together 

with corporeality and mentality, 

2. ***khandhapabba*** = section of discerning on five aggregates (***khandh***ā) , 
2. ***āyatanapabba*** = section of discerning on twelve bases (***āyatana***), 
2. ***bojjhangapabba*** = section of discerning on seven factors of enlightenment as 

priority, 

5. ***sacca  pabba***  =  section  of  discerning  on  four  Noble  Truths  through 

***dukkasacca***  and  ***samudaya  sacca***,  as  priority,  contemplation  of  the  principle  of ***dhamma***s  (***dhammānupassanā***  ***satipaṭṭhāna***)  is  available.  Among  three  kinds  of practices on mentality (***nāmamkammaṭṭhāna***), a kind of ***vipassanā*** practice, through which this cascade of processes includes, viz, the contact (***phassa***) as priority together with  associating  mental  ***dhammas***  are  kept  in  mind,  then  object  corporeality  and depended base-corporeality of those mental ***dhammas*** are kept in mind, afterwards causal  ***dhammas***  of  those  mentality  and  corporeality  are  scrutinizes,  lastly  those mentality and corporeality together with causal ***dhammas*** are discerned as ***anicca, dukkha,  anatta***,  is  also  designated  as  ***dhammānupassanā***  ***satipaṭṭhāna*** (contemplation of the principle of ***dhammas***. An another kind of ***vipassanā*** practice, through which this cascade of processes includes, viz, conditioned things which are objects of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge are kept in mind  through aggregate method, base method,  factors  of  enlightenment  method,  four  Noble  Truths  method,  then  causal ***dhammas*** of those ultimate corporeal and  mental ***dhammas*** are scrutinized, lastly those  mentality  and  corporeality  together  with  causal  ***dhammas***  are  discerned  as ***anicca,  dukkha,  anatta***,  is  also  designated  as  ***dhammānupassanā***  ***satipaṭṭhāna***. \_\_\_\_\_ (4) 

**PAGE-476** 

For  all  four  kinds  of  contemplation,  those  objects  as  priority  ones,  bodily constituents (***kāya***), feeling (***vedan***ā), consciousness (***citta***), principle of ***dhammas,*** (***dhamma***),  are  only  conditioned  things  (***saṅkhāra***  ***dhamma***)  called  corporeality, mentality causes and results. If ***vipassanā*** practice is carried out over and over again by means of discerning as three general characters of conditioned things occurring in three periods, and two continuums, it can be said that four kinds of contemplation are developed simultaneously. However because during mundane ***vipassanā*** practice, all four kinds of contemplation cannot be achieved, simultaneously within the same mind moment, it can be said that "during mundane ***vipassanā*** practice, all four kinds of contemplation can be achieved at each mind moment respectively". However at the moment of Noble Path all four kinds of contemplation occur simultaneously. 

2. **Four kinds of strenuous effort (*sammappaddhāna*)** 

Due to seeing both the unwholesome deed, which is occurring in the continuum of others but it is never experienced in the continuum of oneself in this recent life and the punishment which is worth killing, bondage through that unwholesome deed, by taking into heart like this , "for the person who practices by means of such way this kind  of  punishment  through  unwholesome  deed  can  arise,"  by  the  time  strenuous effort is fulfilled not to arise that kind of punishment through unwholesome deed, the first  strenuous  effort  (***sammappaddhāna***)  called  trying  not  to  arise  unexperienced unwholesome deed, is available. (1) Due to seeing unwholesome ***dhammas***, which is being arisen frequently in the continuum of oneself, which is accustomed to being done,  by  the  time  strenuous  effort  is  fulfilled  in  order  to  eradicate  that  kind  of unwholesome ***dhamma***, the second strenuous effort called trying for eradication of experienced unwholesome ***dhamma***, is available. (2)  

For  the  person  who  endeavours  strenuously  in  order  to  arise  both unexperienced absorption (***jhāna***) and unexperienced ***vipassanā*** in the continuum of oneself  in  this  recent  life,  the  third  strenuous  effort  called  trying  to  arise unexperienced wholesome ***dhamma***, is available. (3) 

If  both  experienced  absorption  (***jhāna***)  and  experienced  ***vipassanā***  in  the continuum of oneself in this recent life are being arisen by such means, it never falls back. For the person who endeavours by that means over and over again, the fourth strenuous  effort  called  trying  to  improve  experienced  wholesome  ***dhamma***  is available. (4) 

3. **Four kinds of psychic powers (*iddhipāda*)** 

By the time wholesome ***dhammas***, ***samatha***, ***vipassanā*** etc are being arisen through "willing wish" as a chief, which is an ambitious to attain various kinds of wholesome  ***dhamma***s,  ***jhāna***,  ***vipassanā***,  ***magga,  phala***  and  ***nibbāna***,  the  psychic power of willing wish (***chand-iddhipada***) is available. (1) 

By the time wholesome ***dhammas***, ***samatha***, ***vipassanā*** etc, are being arisen through "willpower" as a chief, the psychic power of willpower (***cittiddhipāda***) is available. (2)  

**PAGE-477** 

By the time wholesome ***dhammas***, ***samatha, vipassanā*** etc, are being arisen through  "strenuous  effort"  as  a  chief,  the  psychicpower  of  “strenuous  effort” (***viriyiddhipāda***) is available. (3)  

By the time wholesome ***dhammas***, ***samatha vipassanā*** etc, are being arisen through  "investigation  (=  wisdom)"as  a  chief,  the  psychic  power  of  investigation (***vīmansiddhipāda***) is available. (4) 

4. **Five kinds of controlling faculties** (***indriya***)  

Both unwholesome ***dhammas*** which are opposite of firm faith (***saddh***ā) and wrong decision (***micchā*** ***dhimokkha***), which is respectful on living, non-living things which  are  out  of  Triple  Gems,  which  is  a  kind  of  false  belief  are  designated  as ***assaddhiya*** (= unbelieving). The controlling faculty of firm faith (***saddh indriya***) can suppress, overcome on those "***asssaddhiya dhammas***". If is capable of controlling on associating ***dhammas*** which are factors of deliverance from ***assaddhiya***. (1)  

The  controlling  faculty  of  effort  (***vīriyindriya***)  can  suppress,  overcome  on idleness  (***kosajja***)  which  is  worth  designating  as  arising  of  unwholesome  mind moment with significant sloth torpor (***thina middaha***). It is capable of controlling on associating ***dhammas*** which are factors of deliverance from idleness (***kosajja***) (2) 

The controlling faculty of mindfulness (***satindriya***) can suppress, overcome on negligence (***pamāda***) called unwholesome aggregate which is caused by carelessness, forgetfulness. It is capable of controlling on associating ***dhamma***s which are factors of deliverance from negligence (***pamāda***). (3) 

The  controlling  faculty  of  concentration  (***samādhindriya***)  can  suppress, overcome on mental derangement (***vikkhepa***) called restlessness of mind. It is capable of controlling on associating ***dhamma***s which are factors of deliverance from mental derangement (***vikkhepa***). (4) 

The controlling faculty  of reason (***paññindriya***) can suppress, overcome on infatuation  (***sammoha***)  with  the  nature  of  nescience  on  the  object  of  ultimate ***dhammas*** as they really are .It is capable of controlling on associating ***dhammas*** which  are  factors  of  deliverance  from  infatuation  (***sammoha***).These  five  kinds  of controlling faculties, actually, can arise simultaneously within the same mind moment during mundane ***vipassanā*** practice. (5) 

5. **Five kinds of strength (*bala*)** 

Due to occurrence of both undeserving to  oppress by those ***dhammas***, viz, ***asssaddhiya, kosajja, pamāda, sammoha***, and unshaking and stability (on the object of  conditioned things), five kinds of ***dhammas*** called firm faith (***saddh***ā) strenuous effort  (***viriya***),  mindfulness  (***sati***)  concentration  (***samādhi***)  reason  (***paññ***ā)  are designated as the strength (***bala***). These five kinds of strength (***bala***) can also arise simultaneously within the same mind moment during mundane ***vipassanā*** practice. 

6. **Seven factors of enlightenment (*bojjhanga*)** 

Due to occurrence of basis of a being who is capable of knowing on Four kinds of Noble Truths these seven kinds of ***dhammas*** mindfulness, investigation of doctrine (***dhamma***  ***vicāya***)  effort,  pleasurable  interest  (***pīti***),  tranquility  (***passaddhi***) concentration,  neutrality  (***upekkh***ā)  are  designated  as  b***ojjhanga***  (  =  factors  of enlightenment).  These  seven  kinds  of  factors  of  enlightenment  can  also  arise simultaneously within the same mind moment during mundane ***vipassanā*** practice. 

The mindfulness which  is capable of keeping in mind ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas*** (conditioned things) called all bodily constituents, feeling, consciousness, principle of ***dhamma***  together  with  causal  ***dhammas***,  is  known  as  ***satisambojjhanga***,  while ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge which is capable of penetrative knowing on the phenomena of impermanence, suffering, non-self of those ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas*** after investigating reasoning and determining on those phenomena correctly, is known as ***dhammavicāya*** ***sambojjhanga***,  the  effort  associating  with  that  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  is ***viriyasambojjhanga***; the pleasurable interest, ***pītisambojjhanga***, the tranquility, 

**PAGE-478** 

` `***passaddhisambojjhanga***,  the  concentration,  ***samādhisambojjhanga***;  the  mental concomitant called complete equanimity (***tatra majjhattat***ā),  ***upekkhā*** ***sambojjhanga***. This  is  how  seven  kinds  of  factors  of  enlightenment  arise  simultaneously  during mundane ***vipassanā***. 

By the time the supra mundane Noble Path (-moment) the mindfulness that is capable of keeping mind the object of ***nibbāna***, is known as ***satisambojjhanga***; while the Noble path knowledge, which is capable of penetrative knowing and seeing on ***nibbāna***  is  known  as  ***dhammavicāya***  ***sambojjhanga***,  effort,  pleasurable  interest, tranquility,  concentration,  complete  equanimity  (***tatramajjhattat***ā)  are ***viriyasambojjhanga***,  ***pītisambojjhanga,  passaddhisambojjhanga,  samādhi sambojjhanga, upekkhāsambojjhanga***, respectively. 

7. **Eight factors of Noble Path** (***magganga***) 

Due to occurrence of basis of deliverance from all kinds of suffering of rounds of  rebirth,  these  eight  factors,  ***sammādiṭṭhi***  (right  views),  ***sammāsankappa***  (right thought), ***sammavāsā*** (right speech), ***sammākammanta*** (right conduct), ***samm***āā***jiva*** (right  livelihood),  ***sammāvāyama***  (right  effort),  ***sammāsati***  (right  mindfulness), ***sammāsamādhi***  (right  concentration)  are  designated  as  factors  of  Noble  Path (***magganga***). 

Among those eight factors, during refraining from wrong speech, ***sammāvaca*** (right speech), is available, during refraining from wrong conduct, ***sammākammanta*** (right  conduct);  and  during  refraining  from  wrong  livelihood,  ***samm***āā***jiva***  (right livelihood)  is  available  respectively.  Those  remaining  five  factors  of  Noble  Path, ***sammādiṭṭhi***  etc.,  can  arise  simultaneously  within  the  same  mind  moment  during mundane ***vipassanā*** practice. ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, which is capable of penetrative knowing and seeing on phenomena of impermanence, suffering, non-self of ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas***  called  ***dukkha  sacca,  samudaya  sacca***,  is  known  as  right  view (***sammādiṭṭhi***), while the initial application (***vitakka***) associating with that ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge,  is  known  as  right  thought  (***sammāsankappa***),  the  effort,  right  effort (***sammāvāyāma***); the mindfulness, right mindfulness (***sammāsati***); the concentration, right concentration (***sammāsamādhi***) respectively. These five factors of Noble Path can arise simultaneously within the same mind moment during mundane ***vipassanā*** practice. During Supra-mundane Noble Path (-moment) those eight factors of Noble Path can arise simultaneously within the same mind moment appropriately. All factors of Noble Path take the object of ***nibbāna*** at that mind moment. 

Especially  those  qualities  of  associating  ***dhamma***  of  enlightenment, ***vimamsiddhipāda, paññindriya, paññābala, dhammavicaya sambojjhanga, sammā*** ***diṭṭhimagganga***,  which  are  interpreted  the  basis  as  mental  concomitant  called ***paññindriya***  (reason,  knowledge),  is  not  associated  with  the  consciousness  of mundane  ***vipassanā***  without  knowledge  (***ñāṇavipayutta***)  sometimes.  Thus  (37) qualities  of  associating  ***dhammas***  of  enlightenment  (***bodhipakkhiya***  ***dhamma***)  are available in various mind moments during mundane ***vipassanā*** practice. 

On the other hands, by the time these Four Kinds of Noble Path-Knowledge arise,  actually,  these  (37)  qualities  of  associating  ***dhammas***  of  enlightenment  are available simultaneously within the same mind moment. During arising of Fruition (- moment), remaining (33) qualities of associating ***dhammas*** of enlightenment, except four  kinds  of  strenuous  effort  (***samma  ppadhāna***),  are  available.  During Supramundane mind moments, all kinds of ***bodhipakkhiya dhamma*** take the object of ***nibbāna***.  

(See ***Vs - 2 - 320***). 

All  kinds  of  ***bodhipakkhiya  dhamma***,  actually,  concern  with  the  arising  of mind  moment  of  Noble  Path.  Due  to  occurrence  of  function  of  strenuous  effort (***sammappaddhana***) with extremely performance at the moment of the Noble Path, though they concern in that way, the commentary explained that "during arising of Fruition (-moment), except four kinds of strenuous effort." Although it explained that "during  arising  of  Fruition  (-moment),  (33)  qualities  of  associating  ***dhammas***  of enlightenment  are  available,  it  should  be  recognized  that  "it  is  not  worth  getting directly but by means of indirect way". (***Mahāṭī-2-492***). 

**PAGE-479** 

7. **How qualities of associating *dhamma*s of enlightenment arise at Noble Path (- moment).** 

***Pali Quotation (Vs-2-320)*** 

At one Noble Path (-moment) all available kinds of those (37) qualities of associating  ***dhammas***  of  enlightenment  take  the  object  of  ***nibbāna***.  If  the consciousness of Path arises through the first absorption (***pathamajhānika***) it consists of (37) mind and mental concomitants. According to tetrad method (***catukka naya***), if the consciousness of Path arises through the second absorption, it consists of (35) mind and mental concomitants, excluding ***vitakka, vicāra***. If it arises through the third absorption, it consists of (34) mind and mental concomitants, excluding ***Pīti***. If it arises  through  the  fourth  absorption,  it  also  consists  of  (34)  mind  and  mental concomitants, but agreeable feeling is replaced by neutrality feeling at that moment. All mind and mental concomitants of that arising of Path (-moment) takes the object of ***nibbāna***. Among those arising  mind and mental concomitants, the mindfulness (***sati***) is also included. There is a reasonable question that how a single mindfulness takes  objects  of  four  kinds  ***satipatthāna***  ***dhamma***s  (=  application  of  mindfulness) simultaneously. The answer is as follows: -  

Among the ***bodhipakkhiya dhammas*** which are worth getting within one mind moment, a single kind, the mindfulness, which arises by taking the object of ***nibbāna***, performs the function of removing of ... 

1. perception of pleasant (***subhasaññ***ā) on all bodily constituents (***kāya***); 
1. perception of happiness (***sukhasaññ***ā) on feeling; 
1. perception of permanence (***niccasaññ***ā) on consciousness; 
1. perception of self (***attasaññ***ā) on principle of ***dhammas***; simultaneously. 

Thus  due  to  finishing  to  eradicate  these  kinds  of  perception,  pleasant, happiness, permanence, self on ***satipatthāna*** called ***kāya, vedanā, citta***, ***dhamma*** by the Noble Path together with mindfulness, those kinds of perception are totally free from ***kāya, vedanā, citta,*** ***dhamma***. Whenever ***kāya, vedanā, citta,*** ***dhamma*** are taken as object, those kinds of perception, pleasant, happiness, permanence, self, never arise but only those kinds of perception, repulsiveness, suffering, impermanence, non-self of ***kāya, vedanā, citta,*** ***dhamma***, arise consequently. This way of realizing can be said that  four  kinds  of  application  of  mindfulness   (***satipaṭṭhāna***)  are  by  functional accomplishment  (***kiccasiddhi***).  Thus  among  those  ***bodhipakkhiya  dhamma***s  which are worth getting within one mind moment of Noble Path, a single kind called the mindfulness  can  be  designated  as  "four  kinds  of  application  of  mindfulness (***satipaṭṭhāna***) " by means of the function of eradication of four kinds of perception, pleasant, happiness permanence, self on ***kāya, vedanā, citta***, ***dhamma***.***  

Similarly, a single kind called the effort which is worth getting within one mind moment  of  Noble  path,  can  be  designated  as  “four  kinds  of  strenuous  effort (***sammappadhāna***), by means of finishing four kinds of functions, trying not to arise unexperienced unwholesome ***dhamma***. There are no variation in numbers of bases of interpretation for ***iddhipāda, indriya, bala, bojjhanga, magga. (Vs-2-320)*** 

**PAGE-480** 

[**Notes\_\_\_** If the Noble Path arises through the first absorption, (37) kinds of ***bodhipakkhiya*** ***dhamma*** can be available appropriately. It arises through the second absorption, the initial application (***vitakka***) will not associate resulting in decreased in factor of right thought (***sammāsankappa magganga***). According to tetrad method, if it arises  through  third  absorption,  ***pītisambojjhanga***  (factor  of  enlightenment  of pleasurable interest) and ***sammāsankappa magganga*** will be excluded. If the Noble path  arises  through  fourth  absorption  ***pītisambojjhanga***  and  ***sammāsankappa magganga*** will be excluded similarly.] 

**To be noticed \*** \_\_\_\_\_ In above explanation, it must be noticed especially on the word, “the mindfulness which takes the object of ***nibbāna*** or the mindfulness together with the Noble Path accomplishes the function of eradication of those kinds of  perception,  pleasant,  happiness,  permanence,  self  on  ***kāya,  vedanā,  citta,*** ***dhamma***.” 

In the field of ***vipassanā*** practice,  

1. with regarding to the word, "***kāya***", all bodily constituents (***rūpa*** ***kāya***) called 

28  kinds  of  corporeality  must  be  interpretted  by  means  of  significant  method (***padhānaya***) while ***nāmakāya*** (mentally constituents) called mental ***dhammas*** which arise depending on those corporeal ***dhammas*** by taking the object of those corporeal ***dhammas*** must be interpreted by means of non significant method (***appadhānaya***) 

2. with  regarding  to  the  word,  "***vedanā***,  "  nine  kinds  of  feeling  must  be 

interpreted by means of significant method. After discerning on feeling as priority, both mental ***dhammas*** together with that feeling and object corporeality and depended corporeality  of  those  mental  ***dhammas***  must  also  be  interpreted  by  means  of  non significant method. (***appadhānaya***). 

3. with regarding to the word, "***citta***," (16) kinds of consciousness or various 

kinds of consciousness which are worth getting in the continuum of ***meditator,*** must be interpreted by means of significant method. After discerning on consciousness as priority,  both  mental  ***dhammas***  together  with  that  consciousness  and  object corporeality  and  depended  corporeality  of  those  mental  ***dhammas***  must  also  be interpreted by means of non significant method. 

4. with  regarding  to  the  word,  "***dhamma***,"  remaining  mental  concomitants, 

which  are  led  by  contact  (***phassa***),  volition  (***cetana***),  except  "those  corporeality, feeling,  consciousness,  which  are  interpreted  as  ***kāya,  vedanā,  citta,***  by  means  of significant  method,"  must  be  interpreted  by  means  of  significant  method (***paddaānaya***). Both those feeling, consciousness which are associating ***dhammas*** of those mental concomitants and object corporeality and depended corporeality of those mental ***dhammas*** must also be interpreted by means of non-significant method. In other words with regarding to the word, "***dhamma***," five aggregates (***khandha***) twelve bases (***āyatana***), seven factors of enlightenment (***bojjhanga***), four Noble Truths, must be interpreted. 

Because the Noble Path accomplishes the function of eradication of delusion, that  is  concealing  on  those  ***kāya***,  ***vedanā***,  ***citta***,  ***dhamma***,  not  to  be  known, simultaneously with the moment of seeing ***nibbāna***, if the ***meditator*** reflects those ***kāya***, ***vedanā***, ***citta***, ***dhamma*** again, it can be realized easily. 

If a ***meditator*** suggests himself as a Noble One, above specification is a kind of  touchstone in order to test whether oneself achieves become ***ariyahood*** or not. Unless mere (28) kinds of corporealities are kept in mind and discriminated, unless mind 

**PAGE-481** 

and mental concomitants are kept in mind and discriminated by knowledge through natural  fixed  law  of  consciousness  (***cittaniyāma***);  unless  Doctrine  of  Dependent Origination called causal relationship between ***dukkha sacca*** and ***samudaya*** ***sacca***, is kept in mind and scrutinized by knowledge, even though oneself believes strongly himself as "he has got attainment of ***ariyahood***," he must decides certainly that “I'm not ***ariryahood*** yet”. This is because the Noble Path had already eradicated delusion ( 

- ignorance) which is capable of concealing on Four Noble Truths or ***kāya***, ***vedanā***, ***citta***, ***dhamma***, not to be known as they really are, indeed. 

For a ***meditator***, the occurrence of real Noble Disciple in accordance with the desire of the Supreme Buddha is great beneficial rather than the occurrence of non real Noble One who ends the goal by an other airy philosopher. It should be recognized that one who boasts so as to became ***ariyahood*** depending on flattering of other will continue to float in the ocean of infinite rounds of rebirth. These ***kāya***, ***vedanā***, ***citta***l ***dhamma***, actually, are not only  the ***dhamma***s which can be known after attaining as ariyahood but also the ***dhammas*** which are worth endeavouring to be known before ***ariyahood***  to  be  attained.  This  is  because  these  ***kāya***,  ***vedanā***,  ***citta***,  ***dhamma*** belonging to ***dukkha*** ***sacca***, ***samudaya sacca*** are objects of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge indeed. 

8. **Way of interpreting on bases of *bodhipakkhiya dhamma*s** 

Among  these  qualities  of  associating  ***dhammas***  of  enlightenment (***bodhipakkhiya dhamma***) if pure bases of interpretation are carried out commonly without  mixing  words  each  other  by  ***aggahitaggahana***  (  =  the  method  by  which unhold one must held or counted) there are (14) qualities of associating ***dhammas*** of enlightenment  viz,  ***sati,  vīriya,  chanda,  citta,  pañña,  saddhā,  samadhi,  pīti, passaddhi,  upekkhā***  (=  ***tatramajjhattat***ā)  ***sammāsankappa,  sammāvacā, sammākammanta, samm***āā***jiva***, totally. 

Among those ***dhammas,*** some ***dhammas*** ***sati*** (mindfulness) etc, are preached as various interpretations, (8) kinds etc, though they posses a single nature due to occurrence  of  finishing  of  various  functions,  ***kāyāupassanā***  etc  depending  upon efficiency of each kind. Some ***dhammas***, ***cittiddhipāda*** (psychic power of willpower) etc., are preached as one kind each, due to occurrence as character (***sarūpa***). 

In  this  case,  it  is  interpreted  on  (14)  qualities  of  associating  ***dhammas***  of enlightenment as bases resulting from maximum available bases of ***bodhipakkhiya*** ***dhamma***.  Only  for  the  Path  (-moment)  through  first  absorption,  (14)  kinds  of ***dhammas*** can be available. For the Path (-moment) through second absorption, (13) kinds of ***dhammas*** can be available due to inavailability of ***sammāsankappa***, while the Path (-moment) through third absorption, fourth absorption fifth absorption, each (12) kinds of ***dhamma***s can be available due to inavailability of ***pītisambojjhanga***, respectively according to pentad method (***pañcakanaya***). 

Nine kinds, (1) status.\_\_\_\_\_ those ***dhamma***s with only one character are of nine  kinds  viz,  ***chanda,  citta,  pīti,  passaddhi,  upekkhā,  sammāsamkappa, sammāvācā,  sammākammanta,  samm***āā***jiva***.  They  occur  as  each  status, ***chandidhipāda,  cittiddhipāda  passaddhi  sambojjhanga,  upekkhā***  ***sambojjhanga, sammāsankappa magganga, samm***āā***jiva magganga***, respectively. \_\_\_\_\_ 

***Saddha*** (faith) (2) status.\_\_\_\_\_ The faith varies as two kinds, ***saddhindriya, saddābala*** and it has got two status. 

***Samādhi***  (concentration)  (4)  status.\_\_\_\_\_  The  concentration  varies  as  four kinds,  ***samādhindriya,  samādhibala,  samādhisambojjhanga,  sammāsamadhi magganga*** and it has got four status. 

***Pañña***  (wisdom)  (5)  status.\_\_\_\_\_  The  wisdom  varies  as  five  kinds ***vīmamsidhipāda,  paññindriya,  paññbala,  dhammavicagyasambojjhanga, sammāditthi magganga*** and it has got five status. 

***Sati***  (mindfulness)  (8)  status.\_\_\_\_\_  The  mindfulness  varies  as  four ***satipaṭṭhāna, satindriya, satibala, satisambojjhanga, sammāsati magganga*** and its has got eight status. 

***Vīriya***  (effort)  (9)  status.\_\_\_\_\_  The  effort  varies  as  nine  kinds,  four ***sammappadhāna,  vīriyiddhipada,  vīriyindriya,  vīriyabala,  vīriyasambojjhanga, sammāvāyāmamagganga*** and it has got nine status. 

Due  to  occurrence  of  association  with  the  Noble  Path  which  is  worth designating as ***bodha*** (= enlightenment) due to occurrence of standing as beneficial associates of the Noble Path, these (37) kinds of ***dhammas***, basically (14) kinds of ***dhammas***  are  designated  as  ***bodhipakkhiya  dhamma***.  During  mundane  ***vipassanā*** practice, These ***bodhipakkhiya dhamma***s are available appropriately. 

***Pali Quotation (M-3-124)*** 

- *Bhikkhus* if the mindfulness of breathing (***ānāpānassati***) is developed, four 

kinds of application of mindfulness (***satipaṭṭhāna***) will be fulfilled. If four kinds of application  of  mindfulness  is  developed  seven  kinds  of  factors  of  enlightenment (***bojjhanga***) will be fulfilled. If seven kinds of factors of enlightenment is developed, the Path of Arahant and the Fruit of Arahant will be fulfilled. (***M-3-124***) 

**PAGE-483** 

9. **Way of emerging from *nimitta-pavaṭṭa*** 

There  are  two  kinds  of  ***vipassanā,***  mundane  ***vipassanā***  and  supra-mundane ***vipassanā***. 

The Noble Path knowledge is also designated as ***vipassanā*** due to occurrence of ability to know and see on Four Noble Truths through four kinds of ***abhisamaya*** (= clear understanding), viz,  

1. discriminating on ***dukkha sacca*** by means of ***pariññabhisamaya*** (= clear 

understanding of all objects of ***vipassanā*** practice) 

2. abandoning  of  ***samudaya  sacca***  by  means  of  ***pahānabhisamya***  (=  clear 

under standing on all objects to be abandoned) 

3. facing  with  ***nirodhasacca***  by  means  of  ***sacchikiriyabhisamaya***  (  =  clear 

understanding on the object to be faced )  

4. developing  of  ***maggasacca***  by  means  of  ***bhāvanābhisamya***  (=  clear 

understanding  on  the  Path  to  be  developed)  .  It  is  the  ***supramundane  vipassanā***, indeed. 

In those two kinds of ***vipassanā,*** ***lokiyavipassanā*** (mundane ***vipassanā***) and ***lokuttara*** ***vipassanā*** ( supra mundane ***vipassanā***), the former is unable to emerge from ***saṅkhāra*** ***nimitta***, ( = phenomena of conditioned things) due to presence of object called ***saṅkhāra nimitta***. It is also unable to emerge from ***pavaṭṭa*** ( = cyclic ***dhammas*** which  are  capable  of  continuous  occurring  and  are  called  five  aggregates)  due  to inability  to  remove  totally  to  ***samudaya  sacca***,  which  is  the  basis  of  consequent aggregates (***vipāka khandh***ā).  

The  knowledge  of  Trans-lineage  is  unable  to  emerge  from  ***pavaṭṭa***  due  to inability to eradicate ***samudaya sacca*** totally. It emerages from ***saṅkhāra*** ***nimilta*** due to taking the object, of ***nibbāna*** as object resulting in designating as "***ekatovutthana*** " ( = the ***dhamma*** which emerges from one side). 

These  four  Kinds  of  Noble  Path,  indeed,  emerges  from  not  only  ***saṅkhāra*** ***nimitta***, due to presence of the object of ***nibbāna*** called ***animitta***, that is void of ***saṅkhāra*** ***nimitta***, but also ***pavaṭṭa***, due to ability to eradicate ***samudaya sacca*** totally. Those  ***dhammas***,  therefore,  are  designated  as  "***ubhatovuṭṭhāna***"  (  =  the  ***dhamma*** which emerges from both sides). (***Vs -2-321***) 

***Pali Quotation (Mahāṭī-2-494)***  

Taking the object of ***nibbāna*** as object after abandoning the object of ***saṅkhāra nimitta***, is known as ***nimittato vuṭṭhāna*** ( = emerging from phenomena of conditioned things)  .  The  ability  to  reach  a  situation  with  the  nature  of  incapable  of  arising ***upādinnakapavaṭṭa***  (=  reoccurrence  of  consequent  aggregates  in  future),  resulting from  total  cessation  of  caused  ***dhamma***s  or  ***samudaya  sacca***  called  ignorance, craving,  clinging,  ***kamma-***formation,  action,  is  known  as  ***pavaṭṭato  vuṭṭhāna***  ( =emerging from ***pavaṭṭa***).It should be recognized the fact that due to arising of the path of Upstream-enterer those causal ***dhammas***, ***samudaya sacca***, i.e., ignorance, craving,  clinging,  ***kamma-***formation,  action,  which  are  causes  to  reach  woeful existence, are ceased totally and so forth. Therefore the commentator explained that "the Knowledge of Trans-lineage is unable to emerge from "***pavaṭṭa***" due to inability to eradicate ***samudaya sacca*** totally." (***Mahāṭī-2-494***) 

According to these explanations of ***Visuddhi Magga*** and ***Mahāṭīka***, it may be intended  to  interpret  on  only  "***upādinnakapavaṭṭa***  with  regarding  to  the  word, '***pavaṭṭa***'.  However  the  opinion  of  ***Atthasālinī***  ***Atthakathā***  has  been  presented previously. According to that commentary,  with regarding to the  word '***pavaṭṭa***' it must be interpreted on both 'an***upādinnaka*** ***pavaṭṭa***' and '***upādinnaka*** ***pavaṭṭa***.'

10. **The Knowledge of Trans-lineage (*gotrabhuñāṇa*)** 

The Knowledge of Trans-lineage is a kind of "reason" which occurs by means of emerging , falling back and leaving from external ***saṅkhāra nimitta***. The meaning of external ***saṅkhāra nimitta*** is explained in the commentary of ***Paṭisambhidā*** ***Magga*** as follows.\_\_\_\_\_ 

***Pali Quotation (Patṭsam -A-1-253)*** 

The external ***saṅkhāra*** ***nimitta*** means phenomena of corporeality and mentality which are external to unwholesome mental aggregates occurring in the continuum of oneself.  It  is  right  \*\_\_\_\_\_.  Due  to  both  occurrence  of  causal  phenomena  to  arise defilements and appearing as forms, outward appearance, man, woman, person, being, human,  heavenly  being,  ***brahma***  etc,  for  worldling  without  eye  of  wisdom  every mundane conditioned thing is worth designating as ***nimitta*** ***dhamma***. (***Patṭsam-A-1- 253***) 

According to this exegesis, defilements occurring in the continuum of oneself is internal ***dhamma***. It is trusted person of oneself. It should be recognized the fact that all kinds of ***saṅkhāra dhammas***, except those defilements all ***dhammas*** occurring in three Realms or (31) spheres, whether internal or external, whether it is living ***upādinnaka*** ***saṅkhāra*** or nonliving an***upādinnaka*** ***saṅkhāra***, are external ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas***. The fact relating to the way of emerging from these external ***saṅkhāra dhammas*** and entering into ***nibbāna*** is preached in ***Patṭsambhida Magga*** as follows. 

After  emerging  (leaving)  from  "***uppāda***"  which  is  arising  of  consequent aggregates in this life due to presence of previous action (***kamma***), it is capable of entering into "***anuppāda***" which is non arising of consequent aggregates. Therefore it is   designated  as  "***gotrabhu***"  (Trans-lineage).  After  emerging  (=  leaving  )  from ***upādinnaka***  ***pavaṭṭa***  which  is  continuous  processes  of  continuity  of  consequent aggregates due to presence of previous action (***kamma***), it is capable of entering into "appa***vaṭṭa***" called ***nibbāna*** where continuous processes of continuity of consequent aggregates never arise ...R... After emerging ( = leaving ) from “***ayūhana***” which is endeavouring to perform “action (***kamma***)” called the cause of process of NONE in future, it is capable of entering into ***'anāyūhana***' called ***nibbāna*** which is void of endeavouring to perform “action (***kamma***), the cause of process of NONE .... R.... After  emerging  (=  leaving  )  from  “***paṭisandhi***”  which  is  arising  of  consequent aggregates in future, it is capable of entering into ***nibbāna*** without ***paṭisandhi*** ....R.... After emerging ( = leaving from “existence” which is dependence of '***paṭisandhi***, it is capable  of  entering  into  ***nibbāna***  which  is  void  of  'existence'  the  dependence  of '***paṭisandhi***'  ...  R  ...  After  emerging  (  =  leaving)  from  '***nibbatti***'  which  is  obvious occurrence  of  five  aggregates,  it  is  capable  of  entering  into  ***nibbāna***  without “***nibbatti***” called obvious occurrence of five aggregates ... R ... After emerging from '***vipakāpavatti***' which is arising of continuity of consequent aggregates, it is capable of entering into ***nibbāna*** without ***vipakāpavatti*** ... R ... After emerging ( = leaving ) from 'birth (***jāti***)' which is arising of aggregates as a beginning of one life, it is capable of entering into ***nibbāna*** without birth (***jāti***) .... R ... After emerging (= leaving) from aging (***jar***ā) it is capable of entering into ***nibbāna*** without again... R ... After emerging ( = leaving) from 'decaying ' (***vyādhi***), it is capable of entering into ***nibbāna*** without decaying ... R.... After emerging ( = leaving ) from 'death (***mara***ṇ***a***), it is capable of entering into ***nibbāna*** which is void of death (***mara***ṇ***a***), ... R ... After emerging (= leaving) from sorrow (***soka***), it is capable of entering into ***nibbāna*** which is void of sorrow (***soka***), ... R ... After emerging (= leaving) from 'lamentation (***parideva***), it is capable of entering into ***nibbāna*** which is void of lamentation … R … After emerging (= leaving) from woe it is capable of entering into ***nibbāna*** which is void of woe (***upāyāsa***) ... R … After emerging (=leaving) from phenomena of external conditioned things (***bahiddha saṅkhāra nimitta***), it is capable of entering into ***nibbāna*** which is the cessation of ***saṅkhāra***. (***Patṭsam***-***63,46***) 

11. ***Ubhatovuṭṭhāna* (both sides emerging) the Path Knowledge**  

How  the  Path  Knowledge  called  “the  wisdom”  which  occurs  by  means  of emerging (= falling back and leaving) from both sides of “***nimitta***", ***'pavaṭṭa***' arise\_\_\_ ***sammādhiṭṭhi*** \_\_\_\_\_ At the moment of the Path of Upstream-enterer, ***sammādhiṭṭhi*** (right  view)  emerges  from  (62)  kinds  of  wrong  views  (***micchādiṭṭhi***)  through  the meaning of clear realizing on very profound essence of Four Noble Truths with the characters  of  ***pariññābhisamaya,  pahānābhisamaya,  sacchikiriyā-bhisamaya, bhānābhisamaya***. It emerges from both those defilements, ***vicikicchā*** (scepsis) etc, that follows successively to wrong views, the cause of reaching to woeful existence, and aggregates (***khandh***ā) that follows successively to that wrong view. It emerges from  all  kinds  of  external  phenomena  of  conditioned  things  (***bhiddha  saṅkhāra nimitta***),  except  defilement  aggregate  occurring  in  the  continuum  of  oneself. Therefore it can be said that the wisdom (***paññ***ā) which occurs by means of emerging, falling back, leaving from both sides of ‘***nimitta, pavatta***’, is known as the knowledge arising at the Noble Path (-moment). (***Paṭisam-66***) 

***tadanuvattaka kilesa*** (defilements that following to wrong view) \_\_\_\_\_ The Path-Knowledge  of  Upstream-enterer  emerges  from  (62)  kinds  of  wrong  through eradicating  to  underlying  tendency  of  wrong  view  (***diṭṭhānusaya***)  without  any remains. It also emerges from various kinds of defilements, which are associating with wrong  view  within  the  same  mind  moment,  which  have  supporting  factor  of  the relation of determinative dependence (***upanissaya paccaya***) of wrong view, which always  follow  wrong  view.  With  regarding  to  that  word,  it  means  removing  on ***tadekaṭṭha  kilesa***  (=  defilements  with  the  same  dependence  of  that  wrong  view). There are two kinds of ***ekaṭṭha, sahajekaṭṭha*** and ***pahānekaṭṭha***. 

***Sahajekaṭṭha*** \_\_\_\_  Those defilements which are occurring both within one mind moment, and in the continuum of one person, associating with that wrong view until it is removed by the Noble Path, is ***tadekaṭṭha*** ( = defilements with the same dependence of that wrong view) . When the Noble Path eradicates wrong view (***diṭṭhi***) both  these  defilements,  selfish  desire  (***lobha***),  delusion  (***moha***),  unrest  (***uddacca***), shamelessness (***ahirika***), dreadlessness (***anottappa***) which are associating with that wrong view in two kinds of consciousness, consciousness with wrong view rooted in greed unprepared (***lobhamūla diṭṭhigata sampayutta a-saṅkhārika citta***) and these defilements,  selfish-desire,  delusion,  sloth  (***thina***),  unrest,  shamelessness, dreadlessness,  which  are  associating  with  that  wrong  view  in  two  kinds  of consciousness, consciousness with wrong view rooted in greed, prepared (***lobha mūla diṭṭhigata  sampayutta  sasaṅkhārika  citta***),  are  also  eradicated  by  the  Path  of Upstream-enterer through ***sahajekaṭṭha***. 

***Pahanekaṭṭha*** \_\_\_\_ When the path knowledge of Upstream-enterer eradicates the defilement called wrong view, these defilements, selfish desire, hate, delusion, conceit, sceptic, sloth, unrest, shamelessness, dreadlessness, which are causes to reach woeful existence, which are occurring together with wrong view in the continuum of one person, are also eradicated by means of ***phānekaṭṭha***. 

***Khandehi***  \_\_\_\_\_  In  the  word,  "it  emerges  from  aggregates  (***khandha***)  that follows successively to that wrong view," those aggregates are \_\_\_\_\_ 

1) Four  mental  aggregates  of  consciousness  and  mental  concomitants  with 

wrong view, rooted in greed, which are associating with that wrong view within the same  mind  moment  and  are  following  successively  to  that  wrong  view, (***sahajetkaṭṭhakhandha***), 

**PAGE-486** 

2) four mental aggregates of consciousness and mental concomitants without 

wrong  view  rooted  in  greed  (***lobhamūla  diṭṭhigatavippayutta  citta  cetasika***),  four mental  aggregates  of  consciousness  and  mental  concomitants  rooted  in  hate (***dosamūlacitta  cetasika***),  four  mental  aggregates  of  consciousness  and  mental concomitants, rooted in delusion (***mohamūla citta cestasika***), which are associating with defilements, selfish desire, hate, delusion etc, that are causes to reach woeful existence and are ***phanekaṭṭha*** with that wrong view, (***pahanekaṭṭha khandha***), 

3) corporeal aggregate (***rūpakkhandha***) called corporeality produced by mind 

(CPM)  (***cittajarūpa***),  which  are  caused  by  unwholesome  mind  and  mental concomitants of those ***sahajekaṭṭha*** and ***pahanekaṭṭha*** kinds, totally five aggregates, (These are five kinds of aggregates called ***anupādinnaka pavaṭṭa***), and  

4) consequent five aggregates which are worth arising future, due to presence 

of those defilements, that wrong view etc, (These are five kinds of aggregates called ***upādinnaka*** ***pavatta***). 

The Path Knowledge of Upstream-enterer emerges from these five kinds of aggregates of both ***anupādinnaka*** and ***upādinnaka*** ***pavatta***, really. 

5) ***Pali Quotation*** (***Paṭisam-A-1-255-256***) 

If should be recognized the fact that "***bahiddhā*** ***ca sabbanimittehi***" means all kinds  of  (internal,  external)  ***saṅkhāra***  ***dhammas***,  excluding  defilement  aggregate occurring  in  the  continuum  of  oneself,  from  which  the  path  of  Upstream-enterer emerges. (***Patṭsam-A-1-255,256***) 

This  exegesis  of  commentary  of  ***Patṭsambhida  Magga***,  shows  the  same opinion, as previous mentioned in the commentary of ***Aṭṭhasalini***, that "the Noble Path emerges from both two kinds of ***khandha*** ***pavaṭṭa***, ***anupādinnaka***, ***upādinnaka***, and all kinds of phenomena of conditioned things (***saṅkhāra nimitta***). 

***Sammasankappa:*** Right thought (***sammasankappa***) associating with the Noble Path emerges from wrong thought (***micchā*** ***sankappa***) through the meaning of ability to  apply  associating  ***dhammas***  on  the  object  of  ***nibbāna***.  It  emerges  from  both defilements  and  aggregates  (***khandha***)  which  are  capable  of  following  to  wrong thought. It also emerges from all kinds of external phenomena of conditional things. Therefore it can be said that the wisdom (***pañña***) which occurs by means of emerging, falling back, leaving from both sides of ***nimitta***, ***pavaṭṭa***, is known as the knowledge arising at the Noble Path (-moment). (***Patṭsam-66***) 

The Path Knowledge of Upstream-enterer emerges from wrong thoughts (= initial  application,  ***vitakka***)  which  are  associating  with  both  five  kinds  of consciousness,  viz,  four  kinds  of  consciousness  with  wrong  view  (***diṭṭhigata sampayutta citta***), one kind of consciousness with sceptic, which are worth removing by the Path of Upstream-enters, and remaining kinds of unwholesome consciousness which are causes to reach woeful existences (***apāyagamanīya***). (***Paṭisam-A-1-256***) 

***Sammāvācā***  Right  speech  (***sammāvāc***ā)  associating  with  the  Noble  Path emerges from wrong speech (***micchāvāc***ā) through the meaning of ability to keep. It emerges  from  both  defilements  and  aggregates  (***khandha***),  which  are  capable  of following to wrong speech. It also emerges from all kinds of external phenomena of conditional things. Therefore it can be said that the wisdom (***pañña***) which occurs by means  of  emerging,  falling  back,  leaving  from  both  sides  of  ***nimitta***,  ***pavaṭṭa***,  is known as the knowledge arising at the Noble Path (-moment). (***Patṭsam-66***) 

It  means  that  it  emerges  from  both  lying  (***musāvāda***)  and  slandering (***pisunavāc***ā),  speech  with  vulgar  slang  (***pharusavāc***ā),  flattering (***samphappalāpavāc***ā). 

**PAGE-487** 

***Sammākammanta*** \_\_\_\_\_ Right conduct (***sammākammanta***) associating with the Noble path emerges from misconduct (***micchākammanta***) through the meaning of ability to occur polite bodily manners but not rude manners. It emerges from both defilements and aggregates (***khanda***) which are capable of following to misconduct (***micchākammanta***).  It  also  emerges  from  all  kinds  of  external  phenomena  of conditional things. Therefore it can be said that the wisdom (***pañña***) which occurs by means  of  emerging,  falling  back,  leaving  from  both  sides  of  ***nimitta***,  ***pavaṭṭa***,  is known as the knowledge arising at the Noble Path (-moment). (***Patṭsam-66***) 

It emerges from killing being (***p***āṇā***tipāta***) stealing (***adinnadān***ā) and sexual misconduct (***kamesumicchācāra***). 

***samm***āā***jiva\_\_\_\_\_*** Right livelihood (***samm***āā***jiva***) associating with the 

` `Noble  Path  emerges  from  wrong  livelihood  (***micchājiva***)  through  the  meaning  of capable of purifying the livelihood. It emerges from both defilements and aggregates (***khandha***), which are capable of following to wrong livelihood. It also emerges from all kinds of external phenomena of conditional things. Therefore it can be said that the wisdom (***pañña***) which occurs by means of emerging, falling back, leaving from both sides of ***nimitta***, ***pavaṭṭa***, is known as the knowledge arising at the Noble Path (- moment). (***Patṭsam-66***) 

It emerges from these kinds of wrong livelihood, viz, three kinds of bodily misconducts, four kinds of verbally misconducts, relating to livelihood, such as deceit (***kuhana***),  talking  over  (***lapana***),  prognostication  (***nemittikat***ā),  insinuation (***nippesikat***ā) to obtain four requisites, covetousness through giving little worldly gain for great ones (***lābhena labham nijigīsanat***ā). 

***Sammāvāyāma***\_\_\_\_\_ Right effort (***sammāvāyāma***) associating with the Noble path emerges from wrong effort(***micchāvāyāma***) through the meaning of capable of supporting to associating ***dhammas*** of the Noble path in order to reach on the object of ***nibbāna***. It emerges from both defilements and aggregates (***khandha***) which are capable  of  following  to  wrong  effort.  It  also  emerges  from  all  kinds  of  external phenomena of conditional things. Therefore it can be said that the wisdom (***pañña***) which occurs by means of emerging, falling back, leaving from both sides of ***nimitta***, ***pavaṭṭa***, is known as the knowledge arising at the Noble Path (-moment). (***Patṭsam- 66***) 

It emerges from various kinds of wrong effort which are associating with both these five kinds of consciousness, viz, four kinds of consciousness with wrong view, one consciousness with sceptic and remaining kinds of unwholesome consciousness which are causes to reach woeful existences (***apāyagamanīya***). 

***Sammāsati*** \_\_\_\_\_ Right mindfulness (***sammāsati***) associating with the Noble Path  emerges  from  wrong  mindfulness  through  the  meaning  of  capable  of  fixed standing on the object of ***nibbāna***.

Therefore it can be said that the wisdom (***pañña***) which occurs by means of emerging, falling back, leaving from both sides of ***nimitta***, ***pavaṭṭa***, is known as the knowledge arising at the Noble Path (-moment). (***Patṭsam-66***) 

***Pali Quotation (Patṭsam -A- 1-256) (Mahāṭī-2-494)*** 

Various kinds of unwholesome consciousness and mental concomitants, which are  arising  by  means  of  the  opposite  nature  of  mindfulness  and  remembering  on unwholesome deeds, are known as wrong mindfulness (***micchāsati***). (***Paṭisam-1-256***) 

**PAGE-488** 

***sammāsamādhi***\_\_\_\_\_ Right concentration (***sammāsamādhi***) associating with the  Noble  Path  emerges  from  wrong  concentration  (***micchāsamādhi***)  through  the meaning of calmness on the object of ***nibbāna*** without wandering on other ones. It emerges  from  both  defilements  and  aggregates  (***khandha***)  which  are  capable  of following  to  wrong  concentration.  It  also  emerges  from  all  kinds  of  external phenomena of conditional things. Therefore it can be said that the wisdom (***pañña***) which occurs by means of emerging, falling back, leaving from both sides of ***nimitta***, ***pavaṭṭa***, is known as the knowledge arising at the Noble Path (-moment). (***Patṭsam- 66***) 

It emerges from various kind of wrong concentration, which are associating with the mental concomitant called one-pointedness (***ekaggat***ā) which is associated with both five kinds of consciousness, viz, four kinds of consciousness with wrong view,  one  consciousness  with  sceptic,  and  remaining  kinds  of  unwholesome consciousness that are causes to reach woeful existences (***apāyagamanīya***). [Notes \_\_\_\_\_ In various ***Pali Text*** of ***Sutta*** it was also preached on these factors of path  (***magganga***)  viz,  wrong  speech,  misconduct,  wrong  livelihood,  wrong mindfulness. There is no specific basis of meaning for those factors of path. For every kind  of  mindfulness,  there  is  only  one  adorning  mental  concomitant  (***sobha***ṇ***a cetasika***)  called  ***sammāsati***  (right  mindfulness).  Due  to  lack  of  specific  basis  of meaning in that way it was not preached in Pali Text of ***Abhidhamma***. It should be recognized the fact that those unwholesome consciousness and mental concomitants that  are  occurring  while  various  kinds  of  wrong  speech  relating  to  four  verbally misdeeds, are designated as ***micchāvācā***, while those unwholesome ***dhammas*** that are occurring while various kinds of misconducts relating to three bodily misdeeds, as ***micchākammanta***,  those  unwholesome  ***dhammas***  that  are  occurring  while  various kinds of wrong livelihood , as ***micch***āā***jiva***, those unwholesome ***dhammas*** which are predominant with unwholesome perception (***akusala saññ***ā) while various misdeeds are remembered again, as ***micchāsati*** respectively.] 

Because  the  Path  of  Upstream-enterer  eradicates  both  five  kinds  of unwholesome  consciousness  and  mental  concomitants,  i.e.,  four  kinds  of consciousness with wrong view and one consciousness with sceptic, and remaining unwholesome  consciousness  and  mental  concomitants  which  are  causes  to  reach woeful  existences  it  can  be  said  the  Path  of  Upstream-enterer  emerges  from unwholesome mental ***dhammas*** together with wrong view and sceptic and remaining unwholesome  consciousness  and  mental  concomitants  which  are  causes  to  reach woeful existences. 

This is the way showing how eight factors of path emerge from both opposite ***dhammas,  micchādiṭṭhi***  etc,  those  defilements  that  follows  to  opposite  ***dhammas, micchādiṭṭhi***  etc,  various  aggregates  and  all  kinds  of  phenomena  of  external conditioned things (***bahiddha saṅkhāra nimitta***) at the arising of Path (-moment) of Upstream-enterer.  Now  it  will  be  continued  to  present  how  those  processes  of emerging from defilement aggregates etc, occur at arising of Path (-moment) of Once- returnee etc. 

**Path  (moment)  of  Once-returnee**  \_\_\_\_\_  At  the  path  (-moment)  of  Once- returnee, right view (***sammādhiṭṭhi***) emerges from wrong view through the meaning of capable of knowing on Four Noble Truths ... R ...

R ...  

**Path  of  Non-returnee**  \_\_\_\_  At  the  Path  (-moment)  of  Non-returnee  right  view (***sammādiṭṭhi***) emerges from wrong view through the meaning of capable of knowing on Four Noble Truths ... R ... Right concentration emerges from both scarce, subtle fetters of sensual desire (***kamarāga***) 

**PAGE-489** 

and repulsion (***paṭigha***) and scarce, subtle underlying tendency of sensual desire and scarce, subtle underlying tendency of repulsion through the meaning of calmness on the object of ***nibbāna*** ... R .... 

**Path of Arahant** \_\_\_\_\_ At the Path (-moment) of Arahant, right view (***sammādiṭṭhi***) emerges from wrong view through the meaning of capable of knowing on four Noble Truths ... R ... Right concentration emerges from both fetters of desire to existence of fine material sphere and immaterial sphere (***rūparāga arūparāga***), fetter of conceit, fetter of unrest, fetter of ignorance, and these kinds of underlying tendency, conceit, desire  to  existence,  ignorance  through  the  maning  of  calmness  on  the  object  of ***nibbāna***  without  wandering  on  other  ones.  It  emerges  from  both  defilements  that follows to" desire to existence of fine material sphere "etc and aggregates (***khandha***) which  follows  to  that  defilement.  It  also  emerges  from  all  kinds  of  external phenomena of conditional things. Therefore it can be said that the wisdom (***pañña***) which occurs by means of emerging, falling back, leaving from both sides of ***nimitta***, ***pavaṭṭa***, is known as the knowledge arising at the Noble Path (-moment). (***Patṭsam- 66***) 

In three kinds of Upper Noble Path, the path of Once-returnee, the Path of Non returnee, the Path of Arahant, the right view (***sammādiṭṭhi***) emerges from conceit which is worth eradicating by each kind of Noble Path. It is right\_\_\_\_\_ That conceit stands  in  the  place  of  wrong  view  by  means  of  "I  am".  However  it  should  be recognized on the fact that it is never preached specifically on emerging of these three kinds  of  Upper  Noble  path  as  "emerges  from  wrong  view"  etc,  but  it  has  been preached  specifically  on  emerging  from  fetters  and  various  kinds  of  underlying tendency which are worth eradicating by each Noble Path respectively. (***Mahāṭī-2- 495***) 

**9.12.A. Efticiency of *samatha*, efficiency of *Vipassan***ā**  

While eight kinds of mundane attainment (***samāpatti***) are being developed, the efficiency of ***samatha*** (***samathabala***) is predominant due to occurrence of practice of concentration  (***samādhibhāvan***ā).  While  contemplation  on  impermanence (***aniccanupassan***ā)  etc  are  being  developed,  the  efficiency  of  ***Vipassanā*** (***vipassanābala***  )  is  predominant,  due  to  presence  of  extremely  strong  ***Vipasanā*** Knowledge.  Then  at  the  Noble  Path  (-moment),  actually,  those  concentration  and wisdom  called  ***samatha***  ***vipassanā***  arise  harmoniously  as  two  bulls  with  equal strength, which are yoking together (***yuganaddha***), due to lack of predominance of ***samatha***  or  ***vipassanā***  on  each  other.  Therefore  in  these  four  kinds  of  Path Knowledge, both kinds of efficiency of ***Samatha*** and efficiency of ***Vipassanā*** are youking together with equal range of strength. (***Vs-2-322***) 

12. **B. Way of preaching in *Patṭsambhida Magga*** 

`  `***Pali Quotation. (Paṭsam-289)*** 

The  concentration  associating  with  the  Noble  Path  knowledge,  which  is emerging from both those defilements that are associated and predominated by unrest (***uddhacca***) and aggregates that follows successively to unrest, which is the opposite of wandering of mind, ***vikkhepa***, that is called an occurrence of mind with only one object; has the 

**PAGE-490** 

object called ***nibbāna***. Due to presence of ability of repeated discerning over and over again of the mind, which emerges from both defilements predominated by ignorance and aggregates following to that ignorance, ***vipassanā*** practiec has the object called ***nibbāna***. 

Thus  ***samatha***  (=  concentration)  and  ***vipassanā***  (=wisdom)  have  the  same function  through  the  occurrence  of  capable  of  emerging  from  both  ***nimitta***  (= phenomena  of  conditioned  things)  and  ***pavaṭṭa***  (=  ***upadinnka  pavaṭṭa*** ***anupādinnakapavaṭṭa)***.  As  two  bulls  with  same  strength,  which  are  being  yoked together, they arise harmoniously but not predominantly . Therefore it can be said that ***samatha*** and ***vipassanā*** are developed equally, as two bull with same strength, which are being yoked together, through the occurrence of capable of emerging from ***nimitta*** and ***pavaṭṭa***. (***Patṭsam- 289***) 

This is how ***yuganaddha*** (yoking together) can be occurred, due to presence of equal  strength  and  equal  efficiency  of  controlling  faculties  of  concentration  and wisdom at the Noble Path (-moment) and how the Noble Path Knowledge associates with both kinds of efficiency of ***samatha*** and ***vipassanā*** . The way of ***yuganaddha*** can be occurred during ***vipassanā*** practice has been presented previously with reference to ***Yuganaddha Sutta***. 

13. **Defilements (*kiles***ā**) eradicated by the Noble Path**  
1. If the Noble Path eradicates past defilements, it can be said the Rat that 

Noble Path finishes defilements which had been finished; it ceases defilements which had  been  ceased;  it  voids  defilements  which  had  been  voided.  It  can  be  said  the defilement  that  had  been  reached  into  cessation,  had  been  reached  into  cessation again. These past defilements had been ceased naturally when life span of three time phases  called  ***uppāda-ṭhiti-bhanga***,  had  been  finished  resulting  in  designating  as “void  of  defilements  after  ceasing  in  that  way  are  eradicated  by  the  Noble  Path. Therefore it is not true that the Noble Path eradicates past defilements. 

2. If the Noble path eradicates future defilement, it can be said that that Noble 

Path eradicates defilements which are not arising yet because future defilements are not obviously present in the continuity of corporeality and mentality by means of three time phases, ***uppāda-ṭhiti-bhanga***, it eradicates defilements which are not reaching it eradicates defilements which are not reaching, into three time phases, ***uppāda-ṭhiti- bhanga***,  it  eradicates  defilements  which  are  not  arising  apparently,  it  eradicates defilements  which  are  not  obviously  present  because  future  defilements  are  not obviously present in the continuity of corporeality and mentality. Therefore, it is not true that the Noble path eradicates future defilements. 

3. If the Noble Path eradicates present defilements, it can be said that the lust 

(***rāga***) is eradicated during attaching with lust, the hate (***dosa***) is eradicated during burning with hate, the delusion (***moha***) is eradicated during ignoring with delusion, conceit is eradicated during arising of harsh consciousness with conceit, wrong belief with wrong view is eradicated during paying unwise attention with wrong view, the unrest (***uddhacca***) is eradicated during reaching into the situation with unrest, the sceptic (***vicikicch***ā) is eradicated during reaching into the undecided situation with sceptics, the underlying tendency of defilement (***anusaya kilesa***) is eradicated during possessing  with  both  ***thāmagata***  defilements  and  underlying  tendency,  which  are reaching  into  fixedly  standing  situation.  It  can  be  said  that  unwholesome  and wholesome ***dhamma***s are associating together within the same mind moment as those yoking  bulls.It  can  be  said  the  Noble  Path  that  is  associating  with  impurified ***dhammas*** (***samkilesa***) which are causes of impurity of mind, is developed. Therefore, it is not true that the Noble Path eradicates present defilements. 

Unless the Noble Path eradicates those defilements occurring in past, future and  present  in  that  way,  there  is  a  reasonable  question  that  due  to  occurrence  of defilements  in  only  three  periods  whether  developing  of  the  Noble  path  called ***maggabhāvana*** is present or not, (= whether the function of eradicating defilements, which has been finished by occurrence of developing of the path, is present or not); whether  facing  with  the  Noble  Fruition  (***ariya  phala***)  is  present  or  not;  whether eradication of defilement is present or not; whether penetrative knowing and seeing on the four Noble Truths is present or not, etc. The answer is that it is present really, and not absence either. 

**Worldly simile** \_\_\_\_\_ There is a such fruitless tender plant. One man cuts roots of that fruitless plant. There will be such fruits which are not reaching into fruition stage yet in that tender plant. These fruits, which are not reaching into fruition stage, are not arising apparently, due to absence of apparent arising only, those are not appearing  due  to  absence  of  appearance  only,  those  are  not  occurring  yet  due  to absence  of  occurrence  only,  those  are  not  present  apparently  due  to  absence  of apparent presence only. 

Similarly, those aggregates belonging to round of consequence (***vipāka vaṭṭa khandha***) which have the nature of arising (***uppāda***) in recent life due to previous actions (***kamma***) is not only a direct cause (***hetu***) but also an indirect supporting cause (***paccaya***) of occurrence of defilements depending upon those aggregates. After seeing the faults of "five kinds of ***upādinnaka*** aggregates with that nature of arising" the mind enters into ***anuppāda*** ***nibbāna*** (eternal peace with non-reappearing cessation of aggregates), which is void of ***upādinnaka*** aggregates with that nature of arising. 

Because the mind enters into that ***anuppāda*** ***nibbāna***, such defilements could be occurred obviously due to presence of ***upādinnaka*** aggregates with that nature of arising.  “Those  defilements  are  not  arising  apparently  due  to  absence  of  apparent arising only; those are not appearing, due to absence of appearance only; those are not occurring obviously due to absence of obvious occurrence only; those are not present apparently,  due  to  absence  of  apparent  presence  only;  thus  due  to  cessation  of defilements which are causal ***dhammas***, the cessation of resultant suffering, which will be arisen in future, occurs consequently."  

In  order  to  arise  defilements  continuous  occurrence  of  continuity  of ***upādinnaka*** aggregates called ***pavaṭṭa*** is not only a direct cause (***hetu***) but also an indirect  supporting  cause  (***paccaya***)  of  occurrence  of  defilements  depending  upon those aggregates ... R...  

Phenomena of conditioned things (***saṅkhāra nimitta*** is not only a direct cause (***hetu***) but also an indirect supporting cause (***paccaya***) of occurrence of defilements depending upon those phenomena of conditioned things ... R ...  

Endeavouring of actions (***āyūhana***) which is the cause of process of NONE in future  is  not  only  a  direct  cause  (***hetu***)  but  also  an  indirect  cause  (***paccaya***)  of occurrence of defilements depending upon that endeavoring of actions. After seeing the faults of “endeavouring of actions (***āyūhana***), " the mind enters into anuppada ***nibbāna*** (eternal peace with non reappearing cessation of aggregates), which is void of  endeavouring  of  actions  (***āyūhana***).  Because  the  mind  enters  into  that ***anuppādanibbāna*** without ***āyūhana***, such defilements could be occurred obviously due 

**PAGE-492** 

to presence of that endeavouring of actions (***āyūhana***). “Those defilements are not arising apparently due to absence of apparent arising only; those are not appearing, due to absence of appearance only; those are not occurring obviously due to absence of  obvious  occurrence  only;  those  are  not  present  apparently,  due  to  absence  of apparent  presence  only;  thus  due  to  cessation  of  defilements  which  are  causal ***dhammas***, the cessation of resultant suffering, which will be arisen in future, occurs consequently." 

Thus the developing of the Noble Path called ***maggabhāvanā*** is present the facing with the Noble Fruition (***ariyaphala***) is present, the eradication of defilements is  present,  the  penetrative  knowing  and  seeing  on  the  four  Noble  Truths  is present.(***Patṭsam-394, 395***) 

As if fruitless tender plant is having roots cut, those fruits with  unfruition stage, which are worth arising in future unless cutting in that way is achieved, will be damaged,  similarly  as  if  those  defilements,  which  are  worth  occurring  unless developing of the Noble Path called "***maggabhāvana*** is achieved, will not be arisen due to achievement of developing of the Noble Path called ***'maggabhāvana***', it can be said  that  those  defilements  are  eradicated  actually.  Thus  it  should  be  paralleled between object of comparison (***upamāna***) and subject of comparison (***upameyya***). 

14. **A *Bhūmiladdhuppanna* defilements**  

***Pali Quotation (Vs-2-328)*** 

With regarding to above exegesis found in Pali Text of ***Patṭsambhida Magga***, which  meaning  should  be  shown?  It  will  be  shown  on  eradication  of  underlying tendency  of  defilements  called  ***bhūmiladdha***.  There  is  a  question  whether  those underlying tendency of defilements called ***bhūmiladdha*** are any kind of ***dhammas*** of past, future or present. The answer is that \_\_\_\_\_ those defilements can be designated as "***bhūmiladdhuppanna***" only.  

***Pali Quotation (Vs-2-328-329)*** 

Unwholesome deed (***akusala***) which is worth designating as '***uppanna***' with the  presence  of  the  nature  of  arising  ,  because  it  is  not  worth  designating  as  the "absence", through the occurrence which is not reached into a situation with the nature of non reappearance in continuums of various kinds of corporealities and mentalities and in various factors of the clinging to existence (***upadāna kkhandah***ā) called living creatures  of  human  beings,  heavenly  beings  etc,  through  the  occurrence  of  non eradicated by the Noble Path, through lacking of eradication of the Noble Path only, is designated  as  "***bhūmiladdhuppanna***".  In  this  case  it  should  be  understood  on  the significance  of  ***bhūmi***  and  ***bhūmiladdha***.  The  ***termbhūmi***,  means  five  kinds  of aggregates occurring in three realms, which are objects of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, which are not distinguished by three kinds of full understanding (***pariññ***ā), i.e., full understanding  on  object  (***ñātapariññ***ā),  full  understanding  on  propagation  of  the course  (***tīra***ṇ***apariññ***ā),  full  understanding  on  course  of  abandoning (***pahānapariññ***ā). It is right. Those five aggregates occurring in three realms, ***kāma*** , ***rūpa***, ***arūpa***, which have not been distinguished by three kinds of full understanding, are designated as “***bhūmi*** (realm), where defilements arise depending on it. 

***Pali Quotation (Mahāṭī-2-500)*** 

All kinds of defilements which are worth occurring in those various factors of the  clinging  to  existence  (***upādānakkhandh***ā)  of  three  realms,  are  designated  as "***bhūmiladdha***". This is because \_\_\_\_\_ those all kind of defilements deserve to get that ***'bhūmi***' (realm) called various factors of the clinging to existences occurring in three realms; which have not been distinguished by three kinds of full understanding; which is the standing place of defilements. Those all kinds of defilement therefore, can be designated as "***bhūmiladdha***". 

That  ***'bhūmi***'  (realm)  is  not  worth  designating  by  means  of  taking  object through those defilements. If it is accepted the opinion that "it is worth designating by means of taking object," it will be resulted in an inevasible fault as follows. 

If  a  worldling  being  with  defilements  takes  those objects  of  even  past  and future aggregates, so to speak moreover the objects of present, defilements can be occurred  in  the  continuum  of  that  being  by  means  of  taking  object  with  unwise attention previously and significantly. Defilements can be occurred by taking objects of physical appearance of even the Supreme Buddha and Arahant who had achieved as "***pariññāta***" due to presence of three kinds of full understanding (***pariññ***ā) on all aggregtes. It should be recognized the fact similar as defilements were being arisen in the continuum of Soreyya, a son of wealthy person, by taking the object of physical appearance of Venerable Mahā Kaccayana Thera; defilements were being arisen in the continuum of Nanda, a young guy who was a first cousin of *Bhikkhun*ī *Uppalava*ṇṇ*a Theri*, by taking the object of physical appearance of that *bhikkhun*ī. Aggregates of Venerable Mahā Kaccayana Thera, actually, were ‘‘***pariññāta***’’ aggregates which had been distinguished by Three kinds of full understanding of himself. Aggregates of Uppalavanna Theri were also ‘‘***pariññāta*** aggregates which had been distinguished by three kinds of full understanding of herself. Because defilements can also be occurred in the continuum of other beings, like a young guy called Nanda, by taking objects of those ‘***pariññāta***’ aggregates, if it is accepted the opinion that “it is worth designating by means of taking object”, it will be resulted in an inevasible fault, “anyone cannot eradicate defilements which are fundamental roots of existence,” due to occurrence of falling of all defilements in the continuum of other beings, like Soreyya, a son of wealthy  person  and  Nanda,  a  young  guy,  resulting  from  inability  to  eradicate defilements occurring in the continuum of other beings through the Path - Knowledge of  Noble  Arahants,  like  Venerable  Maha  Kaccayana  Thera  and  *Bhikkhun*ī Uppalavanna  Theri.  It  will  be  reached  into  the  meaning  that  defilements  called “***bhūmiladdha***” is latently underlain in the physical appearance of Arahant. 

Therefore those defilements, which are arisen by means of taking objects of both “***pariññāta”*** aggregates of the Buddha, Arahants and ***a-pariññāta*** aggregates ( =which has not been distinguished by three kinds of full understanding), of remaining persons, should not be designated as “***bhūmiladdha***”. Actually \_\_\_\_\_ it should be understood  on  ‘‘***bhūmiladdha***’’  as  the  standing  base  or  depended  situation  of defilements.  It  is  right.  \_\_\_\_\_  In  such  such  existence  or  such  such  continuity  of corporeality and mentality ***a-pariññāta*** aggregates, which has not been distinguished by ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, are occurring. In that that existence or that that continuity 

**PAGE-494** 

of  corporeality  and  mentality,  from  the  beginning  of  arising  of  those  aggregates, defilements that are fundamental roots of rounds of rebirth are latently underlying in those aggregates due to lack of any other factor except the occurrence of defilements that has not been eradicated by The Noble Path. There force, it should be recognized the fact that all kinds of defilements that are latent underlying in those aggregates, are designated as ‘‘***bhūmiladdha***’’ ( = defilements which are acquired on a certain stage of existence) due to occurrence of non-eradicated situation by The Noble Path. (***Vs-2- 328, 329***) 

According  to  this  exegesis,  the  aggregate  with  eradicated  defilements  are known as “***pariññāta*** ***khandha***”. Those ***pariññāta*** ***khandha*** are not the sources of defilements (***uppaṭṭhāna***). The aggregate with non-eradicated defilements are known as “***a-pariññāta*** ***khandha***.” That “***a-pariññāta khandha***” is known as the source of defilements  (***uppaṭṭhāna***).  The  former  one,  ***pariññāta***  ***khandha***  are  aggregates  of ***asekkha*** ( = full filled) person called Arahants, while the second one, ***a-pariññāta*** ***khandha*** are aggregates of remaining Noble Ones and worldlings (***puthujana***), except Arahants.  Those  ***a-pariññāta***  ***khandha***  are  ‘***bhūmi***’,  the  place  where  defilements arise,  indeed.  Underlying  tendency  of  defilement  (***anusaya  kiles***ā)  which  are deposited  latently  in  those  ‘***bhūmi***’  is  called  ‘‘***bhūmiladdha***’’,  and  it  should  be recognized in this way. 

**Way  of  depositing**  \_\_\_\_\_  Among  those  aggregates,  which  are  sources  of defilements, in aggregates of such person, underlying tendencies of defilements are deposited  latently,  due  to  lack  of  eradication  through  the  Noble  Path.  Only  those aggregates  of  that  person,  which  are  the  places  of depositing  of  those  underlying tendencies of defilements, are known as the standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of  those  underlying  tendencies  of  defilements.  Those  aggregates  of  other  persons, however, are  not designated as standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of those underlying tendencies of defilements. 

For those underlying tendencies of defilements, which were deposited in past aggregates  due  to  lack  of  eradication  through  the  Noble  Path,  only  those  past aggregates were standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of those kinds. But present aggregates and future aggregates can not be designated as standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of those kinds. For those underlying tendencies of defilements which will be deposited in future aggregates due to lack of eradication through The Noble Path, only those future aggregates will be standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of those kinds. But present aggregates and past aggregates can not be designated as standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of those kinds. ‘‘For those underlying tendencies of defilements which are deposited in ‘‘present aggregates’’ due to lack of eradication through the Noble Path, only’’ these present aggregates’’ are standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of those kinds. But ‘‘past aggregates and future aggregates’’ can not be designated as standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of those kinds. (***Vs-2-329***) 

With regarding to these words, ***bhūmilanddha*** occurs by means of standing bases  but  not  by  means  of  object.  Therefore  it  shows  that  destruction  of  Those underlying tendencies occurs through destruction of standing bases. ***(Mahāṭī-2-501)*** 

Furthermore,  ‘‘For  those  underlying  tendencies  of  defilements  which  are deposited in ‘‘aggregates of sensual sphere’’ due to lack of eradication through the Noble Path, only’’ these aggregate of sensual sphere are standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of those kinds. But aggregates of fine material and immaterial sphere can not be designated as standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of those kinds. ‘‘For those underlying tendencies of defilements which are deposited in “aggregates of fine- material  sphere”  due  to  lack  of  eradication  through  the  Noble  Path,  only  these aggregates of fine-material sphere are standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of those  kinds.  But  aggregates  of  sensual  sphere  and  immaterial  sphere  can  not  be designated as standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of those kinds. ‘‘For those underlying  tendencies  of  defilements  which  are  deposited  in  ‘‘aggregates  of immaterial sphere’’ due to lack of eradication through the Noble Path, only these aggregates of immaterial sphere, are standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of those kinds.  But  ‘‘aggregates  of  sensual  sphere  and  five  material  sphere  can  not  be designated as standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of those kinds. (It means that during cycling in rounds of rebirth only existing aggregates of various specific spheres are  standing  bases,  sources  of  those  respective  underlying  tendencies  of  elements (***anusaya dhātu***). Those aggregates which are occurring in either separated periods, past, future etc, or separated spheres, are not standing bases of underlying tendencies with different periods and spheres. (***Vs-2- 329***) 

**9.14.B. Aggregates That are not worth designating as ‘*bhūmi*’** 

Especially  \_\_\_  Among  Those  Noble  Ones,  the  Upstream-enterer  etc,  in aggregates  of  such  such  Noble  One,  various  kinds  of  underlying  tendencies  of defilements,  which  are  fundamental  roots  of  rounds  of  rebirth,  are  eradicated  by respective Noble Path. Those aggregates of that Noble One can not be designated as ‘‘***bhūmi***’’ because those aggregates are not standing bases, sources, plot of farmland of  underlying  tendencies  of  defilements  which  had  already  been  eradicated.  The nature of latent depositing in continuity of aggregates as the underlying tendencies of defilements can be  known by  having reasoned inductively  through suppressing of outburst of defilements (***pariyuṭṭhāna kilesa***), which arise apparently in the continuity of mind as three-time-phases, ***uppāda-ṭhiti-bhanga***. This is because if the element of underlying tendency is not present apparently, that nature of suppressing of outburst of defilements can not be occurred consequently. In the continuum of such person, elements of underlying tedencies has been eradicated by The Noble Path. It can be said that that person has overcome well on those elements of underlying tendencies because five kinds of aggregates, which are standing bases of underlying tendencies, has been distinguished by three kinds of full understanding. Therefore, it means that those five aggregates (= that standing basis) can not be designated as ‘‘***bhūmi***,’’ the standing bases of those elements of underlying tendencies. (***Vs-2-329, Mahāṭī-2- 501, 502***) 

**9.14.C. Which aggregate is deposited?** 

For a worldling (***puthujana***) with various kinds of defilements, due to lack of eradication  of  any  kind  of  underlying  tendency,  any  kind  of  actions  of  bodily, verbally, mentally, can be occurred as either wholesome deed or unwholesome deed randomly  because  none  of  underlying  tendencies  of  defilements,  which  are fundamental roots of rounds of rebirth, has been eradicated. Due to presence of non- eradicated elements of underlying tendencies, the consequent round (***vipāka*** ***vaṭṭa)*** is cycling through action defilements (***kamma*** ***kilesa***) for that world ling. It should not be said that for that worldling those elements of underlying tendencies are deposited either  in  the  corporeal  aggregate  only  but  not  feeling  aggregate  etc,  or  in  the consciousness  aggregate  only,  but  not  corporeal  aggregate  etc.  This  is  because elements of underlying tendencies are deposited in all kinds of aggregates generally. (***Vs-2-329***) 

**Worldly simile \_\_\_\_\_** It should be understood as the essence of structural constituents of earth (***pathavirasa***) and the essence of structural constituents of water (***āporasa***) which are existing within a tree. It will be explicit. If a kind of tree exists 

**PAGE-496** 

until the end of world by successive seeds occurring in generation by generation after growing with roots, stem, branches, foliages flowers, fruits, which are filled out into the  sky,  due  to  presence  of  essence  of  earth  (***pathavirasa***)  and  essence  of  water (***āporasa***) depending upon those essence of the ground, it should not be said that those kinds of essence of earth and water spread through roots only but not stem, branches, foliage s ... R ... those kinds of essence of earth and water spread through fruits only but not root etc. It should not be said in that way because it spreads through all kinds of roots, stem, branches, foligaes, flowers, fruits. Similarly, it should not be said that those elements of underlying tendencies are also deposited in any kind of aggregates only  but  not  others  etc  due  to  depositing  through  all  five  kinds  of  aggregates thoroughly. (***Vs-2-329***) 

**The nature of reverse meaning** \_\_\_\_\_ A  man who disgusts only flowers, fruits of that tree, beats all arial shoots of that tree with poisonous sting of a ray. As if the tree is beaten in that way, the poison gives rise to loss of essence of earth, essence of  water  and  retardation  of  growth  of  the  tree,  resulting  in  inability  to  reproduce continuity of off springs through generation by generation, similarly, those gentleman and lady who disgust continuous occurrence of aggregates as that man beats all arial shoots of that three with poisonous sting of a ray, endeavour to develop practice of  Four kinds of Noble Path (***catumagga bhāvan***ā) in the Continuity of corporeality and mentality  of themselves.  When they endeavour in that way, in the continuities of corporealities  and  mentalities  of  those  gentleman  and  lady,  defilements  which  are fundamental roots of rounds of rebirth, are lost by the influence of poison called those four kinds of Noble Path resulting in the occurrence of more indifferent functions (***kiriya***) for all kinds of bodily actions, verbally actions, mentally actions of those gentleman and lady. It means neither wholesome action nor unwholesome action will be arisen. Due to reaching into a situation called actions, bodily actions etc, those gentleman and lady reach a situation  with the nature of non reappearance of new existence in future. Due to presence of that kind of situation, continuity of corporeality and  mentality  called  the  "next  existence"  will  not  be  capable  of  arising  further. Actually, due to cessation of consciousness called the final death, complete extinction of ***khandha*** life (***parinibbāna***) and total cessation (of sufferings) occur, resulting from non attachment on any kind of fuels of five aggregates as "I, mine," like forest fire with no fuel of any kind. It should be understood on the significance of both '***bhūmi***' and "***bhūmiladdha***" in this way. (***Vs -2-329, 330***)

**9.15A. Way of knowing on Four kinds of Noble Truths simultaneously**  

The fire of open oil lamp performs four kinds of functions within a moment simultaneously. 

1. It burns and finishes off the wick of open oil lamp consisting of a saucer of 

oil and wick. 

2. It destroys the cloud of darkness. 
2. It shows apparently the light. 
2. If finishes off the gum called oil. 

Similarly the Noble path knowledge knows and sees penetratively on the Four Noble Truths within one mind moment simultaneously. 

1. It  knows  and  sees  penetratively  "***dukkha  sacca***  through  abandoning  of 

infatuate ***dhammas*** (***sammoha dhamma***), which is capable of concealing on ***dukkha sacca***,  not  to  be  known  and  seen  (  =  by  means  of  ***pariññā***  ***bhisamaya***  which  is penetrative knowing and seeing on all kinds  of Noble Truths of suffering, ***dukkha sacca*** totally). 

2. It knows and sees penetratively "***samudaya sacca***" through abandoning of 

infactuate  ***dhammas***  (***sammoha***  ***dhamma***),  which  is  capable  of  concealing  on ***samudaya sacca***, not to be known and seen, ( = by means of ***pahānābhisamaya*** which is eradication of respective defilements called Noble Truths of Cause of suffering, ***samudaya sacca***). 

3. The mental concomitant called knowledge within the Noble Path (-moment) 

benefits the occurrence of remaining seven factors of path (***sattangamagga***), the Right Thought (***sammāsankappa***) etc, by means of efficiency of various kinds of relations, the relation of compatibility (***sahajāta paccaya***) etc.It knows and sees penetratively "***magga  sacca***"  through  destroying  on  infactuate  ***dhammas***  (***sammoha***  ***dhamma***), which is capable of concealing on ***magga sacca***, not to be known and seen (= by means of ***bhavanābhisamaya*** which is proliferation of associating factors of path with the supporting cause of efficiency of various relations, the relation of compatibility etc. 

***Pali Quotation*** (***Mah***āṭī ***-2-503***)  

The Noble path knowledge destroys not only infatuate ***dhammas*** which are capable of concealing on associating mental ***dhammas*** but also infatuate ***dhammas*** which  are  capable  of  concealing  on  itself,  not  to  be  known  and  seen simultaneously.(***Mahāṭī-2-503***)  

4. It  knows  and  sees  penetratively  "***nirodha  sacca***"  through  destroying  on 

infatuate ***dhammas***, which is capable of concealing on ***nirodha sacca*** , not to be known and seen ( = by means of ***sacchikiriyabhisamaya*** which is facing with the total happiness, ***nibbāna***, ***asaṅkhata dhātu*** ( unconditioned element) called ***nirodha sacca***, the Noble Truth of Cessation of suffering. 

With regarding to these words, it means that all Four kinds of Noble Truths are attained, known, seen penetratively by taking the object of ***nibbāna***, ***asaṅkhata dhātu*** called ***nirodha sacca*** as object.  

As the fire of open oil lamp burns and finishes off the wick, similarly the Noble Path Knowledge distinguishes on the Noble Truth of suffering. As the fire of open oil lamp destroys the cloud of darkness, similarly the Noble Path Knowledge abandons the Noble Truth of cause of suffering. As the fire of open oil lamp, shows obviously the light similarly, the Noble Pat-Knowledge shows clearly and give rise to factors of Path, Right though etc, by means of supporting factor f efficiency of various relations, the relation of compatibility etc. As the fire of open oil lamp finishes off the gum called oil, similarly the Noble Path Knowledge faces with ***nibbāna***, ***nirodha*** ***sacca*** which is the lost of gum called defilements. (***Vs-2- 331***)  

**PAGE-498** 

It should be recognized the fact that due to occurrence of cause of presence of dependency, distinguishing of ***dukkha sacca*** is similar to burning of the wick while due to ability of destroying opposite defilements, eradication of ***samudaya sacca*** is similar  to  destroying  of  the  cloud  of  darkness,  due  to  occurrence  of  capable  of spreading light called knowledge out surroundings, developing of ***magga sacca*** is similar to obvious showing on light; due to occurrence of finishing the gum called defilements off through each such means of that various Noble Path, mode of facing with  ***nirodha  sacca***  is  similar  to  mode  of  finishing  the  gum  called  oil  off  by metaphorical usage called ***kar***āṇū***pacrāa*** ( = the name of cause is applied as the name of result). (***Mahāṭī-2-504***)** 

There  are  two  modes  of  knowing  and  seeing  while  The  Noble  Path  - Knowledge  is  knowing  and  seeing  on  Four  Noble  Truths,  i.e.,  by  means  of ***ārama***ṇ***apaṭivedha,*** and by means of ***asammoha paṭivedha*** Penetrative knowing and seeing by facing with those Truths as object, is called “ā***ramma***ṇ***apaṭivedha***”, which penetrative  knowing  and  seeing  by  eradication  on  infatuate  ***dhammas***  which  are capable of concealing on Four Noble Truths not to be known and seen, after finishing The  function  of  realizing  (***kiccasiddhi***)  is  called  ‘***a-sammoha  paṭivedha***’.  During knowing and seeing on ***nirodha sacca***, The Noble Path Knowledge knows and sees it both kinds of modes, ***āramma***ṇ***apaṭivedha*** and ***a-sammohapaṭivedha***. ***Dukkha sacca, samudaya  sacca,***  and  ***magga  sacca***  are  known  and  seen  through  ***a- sammohapaṭivedha***  only.  At  the  Noble  Path  (-moment),  The  arising  Noble  Path Knowledge realizes ***nibbāna*** by taking object it as object, called mode of ***ārammana paṭivedha***. Way of realizing on remaining Three Noble Truths is as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

When The Noble Path-Knowledge arises, it eradicates The cloud of darkness of delusion, which is capable of concealing on Four Noble Truths, not to be known and seen. Due to eradicating in that way, in the continuum of that Noble One, infatuate ***dhammas*** (= delusion = ignorance), which are capable of concealing on ***dukkha sacca*** called  five  factors  of  clinging  to  existence  (***pañcupādānakkhandha***);  which  are capable  of  concealing  on  ***samudaya  sacca***  called  ignorance,  craving,  clinging, ***kamma***-formations, actions, which are capable of concealing on ***nirodha sacca*** called ***nibbāna***, which are capable of concealing on ***magga sacca*** called noble eightfold path, are eradicated totally, resulting in reaching into fulfilled person to know and see Three Noble Truths without taking object those Truths as object although The Noble Path-Knowledge  realizes  The  object  of  ***nibbāna***  only.  It  can  be  designated  that fulfillment of function of realizing in that way is said to be knowing and seeing on remaining  three  kinds  of  Noble  Truth  through  fulfillment  of  function  of  realizing (***kiccasiddhi***). 

**To be noticed** \_\_\_\_\_ If a such person thinks himself as a Noble One, it should be read over and over again on above explanation. Unless five factors of clinging to existence occurring in three periods and two continuums called ***dukkha sacca***, are known by breaking down on each compactness of aggregate up to the field of ultimate reality, unless how the resultant ***dhammas*** called ***dukkha sacca*** arises due to presence of ignorance, craving, clinging, ***kamma***-formations, action, called ***samudaya sacca***, 

**PAGE-499** 

` `the  causal  ***dhammas***,  are  known  by  systematic  ways  of  practice,  it  should  be understood for himself as it is very far from the status of Noble One determined by the Buddha. This is because every Noble One knows thoroughly both causal and resultant ***saṅkhāra dhammas*** every time due to presence of a situation in which the delusion ( =ignorance) that is capable of concealing on those ***saṅkhāra dhammas*** called ***dukkha sacca***  and  ***samudaya  sacca***,  not  to  be  know  and  seen,  is  eradicated  partially  or completely by the Path-Knowledge of each Noble One. For a real Noble One not only ***dukkha sacca*** and ***samudaya sacca*** but also ***nirodha sacca*** and ***magga sacca*** can be known whenever those are taken as object, indeed. This kind of knowing is designated as The Knowing through ‘‘***asammoha paṭivedha***’’. 

**9.15.B. Evidence found in *Pali Text*** 

Relating to the fact, ‘The Noble Path-Knowledge knows and sees penetratively only ***nibbāna***, ***nirdodha sacca***, through ***āramma***ṇ***a paṭivedha***, while it knows and sees penetratively remaining Three Noble Truths or all Four Noble Truths through ***asammoha paṭvedha***, The evidence is as follows. \_\_\_\_\_ 

***Pali Quotation (Sam - 3- 382)*** 

*Bhikkhus* ... such person knows and sees ***dukkha sacca***. That person knows and sees not only ***samudaya sacca***, the cause of suffering, but also ***nirodha sacca***, the cessation of suffering, and ***magga sacca***, the course leading to cessation of suffering called ***nibbāna***. (***Sam-3-382***) 

In above Pali Text The Buddha did not preach with intention that Four Kinds of Noble Truths are known and seen asynchronously but with the intention that those are known and seen synchronously within one mind moment (***ekapaṭivedha***). Evidence is as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

***Pali Quotation (Vibhanga-341, Paṭsam-114)*** 

There is such Noble Path-Knowledge for the person who has fulfilled with the Noble Path. That Noble Path-Knowledge occurs on not only ***dukkha sacca***, ***samudaya sacca*** that is the cause of suffering but also ***nirodha sacca***, the cessation of suffering and  ***magga  sacca***,  the  course  leading  to  cessation  of  suffering  called  ***nibbāna***. (***Viphanga-341, Paṭisam-114***)*** 

These  are  reasonable  evidences  found  in  Pali  Text  how  The  Noble  Path- Knowledge knows and sees simultaneously Four Noble Truths, how ***nirodha sacca*** is known and seen through ***arammana*** ***paṭivedha***, while the remaining three kinds of Noble Truths or all Four kinds are known and seen through ***a-sammoha paṭvedha***, and how  each  Noble  Truth  is  known  by  various  modes,  i.e.,  ***dukkha  sacca***  by ***pariññābhisamaya***;  ***samudaya  sacca***  by  ***pahānābhisamaya***,  ***nirodha***  ***sacca***  by ***sacchikiriyabhisamaya, magga sacca*** by ***bhāvanābhisammaya*** respectively. 

**9.15.C.  Paralleling between the first part of a comparison (*up-amāna*) and The second part of a comparision (*upameyya*)** 

**PAGE-500** 

1. If both five aggregates called ***dukkha sacca*** and the occurrence of those 

five  aggregate  so  far  as  ***dukkha  sacca***,  are  distinguished  thoroughly,  there  is  no oppotunity  to  attach  by  craving  and  wrong  view  on  those  ***pariññātakhandha***  (= aggregates that has been known). Therefore that kind of knowing is the real cause of absence of dependence for obsession as “I, mine” which is called craving, wrong view. Due to this reason, distinguishing on ***dukkha sacca*** is similar to the process of burning of wick by the fire of open oil lamp. 

2. Due  to  capable  of  eradicating  of  each  opposite  defilements  by  the 

respective Noble Path, eradication in that way is, actually, abandoning of ***samudaya sacca***.  Therefore  eradicating,  abandoning  of  each  opposite  defilements  by  the respective Noble Path-Knowledge is similar to the process of removing of cloud of darkness by the fire of open oil lamp. 

3. The Noble Path-knowledge ( = Right View) benefits the occurrence of 

remaining seven factors of Path, Right Thought etc, by means of efficiency of various relations, relation of compatibility etc. By benefiting in that way, associating seven factors  of  Path  are  arisen  and  well  developed  and  it  is  called  “***maggabhāvan***ā.” Developing of ***maggabhāvanā*** called Supra mundane ***magga sacca*** is called thorough shining and spreading of the light of Noble Path-Knowledge. Due to occurrence of capable of thorough shining and spreading of the light of the Noble Path-Knowledge by developing ***magga sacca***, it is similar to the process of showing obviously the light by fire of open oil lamp. 

***Pali Quotation (Mahāṭī-2-504)*** 

Corporealities  produced  by  mind,  which  have  the  nutriment  as  eight  factor (CPM, ***cittajaojaṭṭhamaka rūpa***) are arisen by mind and mental concomitants of the Path (-moment ) (mind and mental concomitants of the Fruition also include). Those corporealities  include  visible  object  called  colour  (***va***ṇṇ***a***)  which  is  brilliant (***bhaāura***).  Then  each  corporeal  unit  of  CPM  consists  of  the  fire-element  called temperature  (***utu***).  Due  to  presence  of  those  temperature  (=  the  fire-element), corporealities  produced  by  temperature,  which  have  the  nutriment  as  eight  factor, (CPT, ***utujaojaṭṭhamaka rūpa***), spread out not only internal but also external. Those CPT also consist of visible-object called colour which are brilliant ones. It should be recognized the fact that causal ***dhammas***, the knowledge, are applied on the name of the  light  of  resultant  corporeal  ***dhammas***,  as  a  metaphorical  usage  called ***taddhammūpacāra, kāranupacāra***. 

4. Facing with ***nibbāna***, ***nirodha sacca***, which is the cause of finishing of 

gum called defilement is similar to the process of finishing of gum called oil by the fire of open oil lamp. By That Noble Path through such such mode, the facing with ***nirodha sacca*** occurs consequently. Due to occurrence of finishing of gum called defilements by that Noble Path-Knowledge through that  that mode, it can be said that facing with ***nirodha sacca*** is similar to the process of finishing of gum called oil by The fire of open oil lamp. 

**PAGE-501** 

**A metaphoric expression using cause for effect**  

The Noble ***dhamma*** ***nibbāna***, ***asaṅkhatadhātu*** ( = unconditioned element) is ***nirodha***  ***sacca***.  It  is  the  object  condition  of  the  Noble  Path.  The  Noble  path- Knowledge is the resultant ***dhamma*** called ***āramma***ṇ***ika*** (= sense owner). Eradication of  defilements  is  performed  by  the  resultant  Noble  Path-Knowledge.  It  should  be recognized the fact that it is a metaphoric expression using the cause, ***nirodha sacca***, ***nibbāna***  for  the  resultant  Noble  Path-Knowledge  which  eradicates  gum  of defilements, (***Kāra***ṇū***pacāra***). 

[These sections of way of (simultaneous) knowing and seeing on Four Kinds of Noble Truths  are presented by extracting from commentary called ***Visuddhi Magga***, vol. 2, page 331, 332, sub-commentary called ***Mahāṭīkā***, vol.2, page 503, 504.] 

16. **Sixteen kinds of meaning of the Noble Truths** 

***Pali Quotation (Paṭisam-296, Vs-2-332)*** 

How Four Noble Truths are known and seen simultaneously by penetrative a single knowledge, as they really are? Four Noble Truths are penetratively known and seen by a single knowledge simultaneously, as they really are, through (16) kinds of modes. 

` `**9.16.A. Four kinds of meaning of *dukkha sacca*** 

`   `**Pali Qus (*Mūla***ṭī***-2-50*)** 

1. ***P***īļ***anattha*** \_\_\_\_\_ Because these two kinds of feelings, mentally disagreeable 

feeling  (***cetasikadomanassa***  ***vedan***ā),  which  is  associating  with  two  kinds  of consciousness,  root  in  hate  (***dosamūla***)  and  bodily  disagreeable  feeling  (***kāyika dukkhavedan***ā),  which  is  associating  with  touching  consciousness  with  suffering (***dukkhasahatgata***  ***kāyaviññāṇa***)  are  both  naturally  and  worth  designating  as ‘‘***dukkha***’’,  These  are  called  ‘‘***dukkhadukkhat***ā.’’  Every  causal  ***dhamma***  of occurrence of that ***dukkha*** ( = suffering) is called ***tannimittat***ā. The bases of that ‘‘***tannimittatā*** are 

**PAGE-502** 

agreeable feeling, neutrality feeling and remaining ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas*** occurring in three realms. Although the agreeable feeling is happiness at the standing phase it gives rise  to  suffering  when  it  changes  and  alters.  Therefore  change  and  alteration  of agreeable  feeling  or  agreeable  feeling  which  is  capable  of  changing  and  altering without  long  lasting  is  the  cause  of  occurrence  of  that  suffering  feeling,  called ***tannimittat***ā.  [***sukha***  ***vedanā***  ṭ***hiti***  ***sukha***  ***vipari***ṇā***madukkha***.  (***M-1-377***)].  Due  to occurrence of being oppressed by  continuous arising  and passing  away, neutrality feeling  and  every  ***saṅkhāa  dhammas***  occurring  in  three  realms  are  designated  as ***saṅkhāra  dukkha***.  Those  ***saṅkhāra  dhammas***  occurring  in  three  realms  called ***saṅkhāra dukkha*** are the causes of occurrence of various kinds of sufferings called bodily  and  mentally  disagreeable  feelings.  It,  therefore,  is  ***tannimittat  saṅkhāra dukkha***.  Every  kind  of  bodily  disagreeable  feeling  on  every  kind  of  mentally disagreeable feeling, which is occurring in continuum of every person with three kinds of perversion (***vipattāsa***) occurs depending upon those ***saṅkhāra dhammas*** occurring in three realms. Every ***saṅkhāra dhammas*** occurring in three realms, therefore, is ***tannimittatā***,  the  cause  of  occurrence  of  suffering.  In  the  aspect  of  Noble  Ones, disagreeable  feeling  called  ***dukkhadukkha***,  agreeable  feeling  called  ***vipari***ṇā***ma dukkha***, and neutrality feeling and every ***saṅkhāra dhamma*** occurring in three realms called ***saṅkhāra dukkha*** are undesireable ***dhammas (aniṭṭhā*** ***dhamma)*** only. Those are groups of ***dhammas*** which have the nature of being oppressed (***p***īļ***anaṭṭha***) by three  kinds  of  sufferings,  called  ***dukkhadukkha***,  ***vipari***ṇā***ma  dukkha***,  ***saṅkhāra dukkha***. 

***Pali Quotation*** (***Abhi-A-2- 88***) 

Due to presence of the nature of being oppressed by continuous arising and passing away, it should be recognized that the Path (-moment) called mind and mental concomitants  of  the  Path,  and  the  Fruit  (-moment)  called  mind  and  mental concomitants of the Fruition, as every ***saṅkhāra dhamma*** occurring in three realms, are  designated  as  ***saṅkhāra***  ***dukkha***  by  means  of  indirect  method  but  not  direct method. (***Abhi-A-2-88***) 

***puggalahinsanam vā*** ***p***īļ***anam. (Mūla***ṭī ***- 2- 50)*** 

***p***īļ***anaṭṭho  tamsamangīno  sattassa  hinsanam  avipphārikatā***  ***kara***ṇ***am. (Mahāṭīi-1-257)*** 

In other words \_\_\_\_\_ The languidness of the continuity of aggregates during suffering is the torturing of ***dukkha*** for the person with five aggregates called that ***dukkha sacca***. Due to presence of torturing of ***dukkha***, those poor persons, though they  are  young  ones,  languish  over  work  without  fresh  and  cheerful  feeling  but languidness. In brief \_\_\_\_\_ it should be recognized the fact that the nature of being oppressed by three kinds of sufferings, ***dukkhadukkha***, ***viparināmadukkha***, ***saṅkhāra*** ***dukkha***, is the ***p***īļ***anaṭṭha*** nature of five aggregates called ***dukkha sacca***. 

The apex sphere of that ***p***īļ***anaṭṭha*** suffering is the existence in four woeful existences (***apaya***). Among those the hell lies at The uppermost realm of suffering. Among joyful existences, That torturing of ***p***īļ***anaṭṭha*** suffering is powerful. Every ***saṅkhāradhamma***  is at  least  being  oppressed  by  continuous  arising and  suffering actually. 

**PAGE-503** 

2. ***saṅkhattaṭṭha*** \_\_\_\_\_ Those five aggregates called ***dukkha sacca*** are, as 

shown in section of Dependent-Origination (***paticca samuppāda***), conditioned things which can be occurred only when respective causal ***dhammas***, ignorance, craving, clinging,  ***kamma***-formations,  action,  nutriment  etc,  are  available  to  provide  their occurrence, indeed. The nature of occurrence of co-operative availabilities of causal ***dhammas*** for conditioned corporeal and mental ***dhammas*** called ***dukkha sacca*** in that way is designated as the nature of ***saṅkhatattha***. 

Conditional  and  prerequisite  preparations  in  that  way  are  also  ***dukkha***  (  = suffering) really. During cultivating on even unwholesome deeds, which are leading to woeful existences, it is surrounded by various kinds of torturing of ***dukkhadukkha, viparināmadukkha,  saṅkhāradukkha***,  called  bodily  disagreeable  feeling,  mentally disagreeable feeling. In order to obtain The Knowledge of Omniscience (***sabbañññuta ñāṇa***), during performing fulfillment of perfections (***pāramitta***), ***bodhisattas*** have to give up Their lives,  organs, sons, daughters, wives, wealth, authority  of kingship. These are showing how ***saṅkhata dukkha*** are so great really. Very rich person can become poor one within one day through donation. Restraining with virtue is also the nature  of  grudging  fulfillment  indeed.  During  developing  ***samatha***  and  ***vipassanā*** practices, chastisement of ***saṅkhata dukkha*** suffering of conditional and prerequisite preparations is so great. Every kind of cultivation of wholesome and unwholesome deeds  for  attainment  of  various  existences  is  only the  nature  of ***saṅkhatadukkha***, indeed. 

3. ***santāpaṭṭha***  \_\_\_\_\_  The  meaning  of  great  worries  with  two  kinds  of 

nature,  ***dukkhadukkhatā***  that  is  really  bodily  and  mentally  sufferings,  and ***tannimittatā*** that is fundamental cause of those bodily and mentally sufferings, of ***saṅkhata dhamma*** called ***dukkha sacca***, is called the nature of ***santāpaṭṭha***. In other words\_\_\_\_\_  the  nature  of  association  of  oppressing  and  heating  elements  called defilements and ***dhammas*** called ***dukkha sacca*** within same continuity of corporeality and  mentality,  is  called  The  nature  of  ***santāpaṭṭha***.  In  other  words  \_\_\_\_\_  Those ***saṅkhata dhammas***, which are called ***dukkha sacca***, are powerful nature of capable of bearing worries and suffering pain as it's acquired nature. Thus the occurrence of powerful acquired nature of itself is designated as the nature of ***santāpaṭṭha***. 

For a practising ***meditator*** who has known and seen phenomena of ***anicca, dukkha, anatta*** of ***saṅkhāra*** ***dhammas*** through the eye of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, That nature of ***santāpaṭṭha*** will be seen clearly in him. 

4. ***Viparināmaṭṭha*** \_\_\_\_\_ The nature of change and alteration through two 

kinds of modes, aging and death in an existence of ***dukkha sacca dhammas*** called  rebirth (***jāti***) with the process of NONE (***paṭisandhi***), is designated as the nature of ***viparināmaṭṭha***.  This  is  the  principle  found  in  the  aspect  of  conventional  reality (***samuti sacca***). In the aspect of ultimate reality (***paramattha*** ***sacca***), actually, five aggregates  which  are  just  arising  apparently  as  three-time-phases,  ***uppāda-ṭhiti- bhanga***, are ***dhukkha sacca*** ***dhamma***. The nature of change and alteration through two kinds of modes, the static phase with out standing as arising phase (ṭ***hiti***) that is called aging (***jar***ā), and perishing phase (***bhanga***) that is called death, of ***dukkha sacca dhammas***, is designated as the nature of ***vipari***ṇā***maṭṭha***. 

**PAGE-504** 

**Significance facts to be made mental note** 

Among four kinds of meaning in ***dukkha sacca***, the meaning of ***p***īļ***anaṭṭha*** is aquired apparent meaning of itself without regarding to other kinds of Truths (***sacca***). The nature of “***saṅkhataṭṭha***” becomes apparent with regarding to ***samudaya sacca*** that is able to perform conditional and prerequisite preparations for “***dukkha sacca***”, as “every ***dukkha sacca*** is ***saṅkhata dahamma*** that is performed by conditional and prerequisite  preparations  of  the  craving  called  ***samudaya  sacca***”.  The  nature  of ***santāpaṭṭha*** becomes apparent with regarding to ‘‘***magga sacca***’’ That is tasting the flavour of total happiness called ***santisukha*** or ***nibbāna***, as ‘‘every perishing ***dukkha sacca dhamma*** is actually hot suffering, dissimilar to the Noble Path which is very peace and calm. (If means that the ***meditator*** can understand the nature of worry and hot suffering of field of ***saṅkhata*** with regarding to the nature of peace and calmness of  field  of  ***a-saṅkhata***).  The  nature  of  ***viparināmaṭṭha***  becomes  apparent  with regarding  to  ***nirodha  sacca***  (=  ***nibbāana***)  which  lacks  any  kind  of  changes  and alterations, as “every ***saṅkhata dhamma*** called ***dukkha sacca*** is real suffering with the  nature  of  change  and  alteration  through  both  aging  and  death,  dissimilar  to ***niibbāna*** that never changes and alter”. (***Mahāṭī-2-50***) 

These four kinds of meaning of “***dukkha sacca***” are true but not false, not wrong. Those ***dhammas*** belong to “***dukkha sacca***” never arise through any  other natures, except four kinds of nature, “***p***īļ***ana*** (oppression)” etc, resulting in designating as ***sacca*** (Truth) consequently. 

**9.16.B. Four kinds of meaning of *samudaya sacca*** 

1. ***āyūhanattha*** \_\_\_\_\_ The cultivation for arising of mass of suffering by 

means  of  extreme  attachment  on  various  sensual  objects  in  various  existences  is designated as the nature of “ā***yūhana***” (endeavouring). In other words \_\_\_\_\_ Due to presence of ‘***samudaya sacca***’, ‘***dhammas*** of ***dukkha sacca***’ is  called “ā***ya***”. The nature of producing that ***dukkha sacca*** called ***āya*** is designated as ***āyūhana***. This meaning  of  endeavouring  called  ***āyūhana***  is  acquired  specific  nature  that  occurs apparently without regarding to any other Truths. 

2. ***nidānaṭṭha*** \_\_\_\_\_ Due to presence of ability to give rise to ***dhammas*** of 

***dukkha sacca***, it is called “***nidāna*** (source). It means that it is capable of producing mass of suffering as making over that… “that suffering is this but not any other.” Only when ***dukkha sacca*** is known and seen, can this meaning of nature of ***nidānaṭṭha*** of ***sumudaya sacca*** be occurred apparently. When oneself knows and sees penetratively ‘‘how five aggregates of process of NONE (***paṭisandhi***), called ***dukkha sacca***, arise in recent life, due to presence of ***samudaya sacca*** called ignorance, craving, clinging, ***kamma-***formations, actions which were cultivated in previous life,” by means of the knowledge called “***sammādiṭṭhi***”, The meaning of nature of this ***nidānaṭṭa*”** will be obvious really. It should be understood for all three periods similarly. 

3. ***samyogaṭṭha***  \_\_\_\_\_  The  nature  of  adhering  for  associating  with 

suffering of rounds of rebirth, not to be detached, of ***samudaya sacca***, is designated as 

**PAGE-505** 

***samyogaṭṭha***. It is the meaning of tying with a bond of suffering of rounds of rebirth not to be released easily. This meaning becomes apparent, due to presence of knowing and  seeing  on  ‘***nirodha  sacca***’  which  is  not  associated  with  rounds  of  rebirth. Continuous occurrence of processes of aggregates-bases-elements (***khandha-āyatana- dhātu***)  is  designated  as  ***samasāra***  in  which  corporealities  and  mentalities  called conditioned things are arising and passing away continuously. During discerning on process  of  perishing  away,  the  practising  ***meditator***  faces  with  ***asaṅkhata  dhātu*** (unconditioned element) called ‘‘***nirodha sacca***” which lacks process of perishing away or processes of arising and passing away. Due to absence of processes of arising and passing away, that unconditioned element, ***nirodha sacca*** is the ***dhamma*** which never associates with rounds of conditioned things that are always arising and passing 

away. It means that due to presence of ability of knowing and seeing on ‘***nirodha sacca***’ which is not associated with that ***samsāra*** (rounds of conditioned things), the meaning of ***samyogaṭṭha*** of ***samudaya sacca***, which has the nature of association with ***samsāra***,  becomes  apparent  consequently.  It  means  that  for  a  ***meditator***  who  has known and seen penetratively by insight knowledge on both how resultant ‘***dukkha sacca  dhamma***’  arises  apparently  due  to  presence  of  causal  ‘***samudaya  sacca dhamma***’ and how resultant ***dukkha sacca dhamma*** ceases due to cessation of causal ‘***samuday sacca dhamma***’ when the faces with ***nirodha sacca*** practically, the nature of ‘***samyogattha***’, i.e., repeated associating with ***dukkha sacca*** over and over again, of that ***samudaya sacca*** has been seen obviously. 

4. ***palibodhaṭṭha*** \_\_\_\_\_ The nature of impeding, to the Noble Path which 

is the cause of releasing from rounds of rebirth is the  meaning  of ***palibodhaṭṭha***, (impediment)  of  ***samudaya  sacca,***  indeed.  When  unconditioned  element,  ***nirodha sacca***, which is the cessation of corporealities and mentalities, which lacks processes of arising and passing away of ***saṅkhata*** ***dhamma***, has been faced with the Noble Path-Knowledge through ***āramma***ṇ***apaṭivedha***. The function to be known on delusion which is concealing on Eightfold Noble Path called ***magga sacca***, which is the course leading to deliverance from rounds of rebirth or processes of arising and passing away of conditioned things, has also been finished through ***asammohapaṭivedha*** with the nature of eradication. Due to presence of capable of knowing and seeing on ***magga sacca*** called the course leading to deliverance of rounds of rebirth, the knowledge of himself falls in the mode of nature of prohibiting to the Noble Path, That is the cause of releasing of rounds of rebirth, of ***samudaya sacca***. ***Maggasacca*** is the ***dhamma*** that leads to release from rounds of rebirth while ***samudaya sacca,*** is the ***dhamma*** that is the cause of cycling of rounds of rebirth. It means that when the ***dhamma***, which leads to releasing from rounds of rebirth, has been known and seen, he also knows and sees ‘***samudaya sacca***’ as the ***dhamma*** which impedes opposite ***dhamma*** which leads to releasing from rounds of rebirth. 

These four kinds of meaning of “***samudaya sacca***” are true but not false, not wrong. Those ***dhammas*** belong to “***samudaya sacca***” never arise through any other natures,  except  four  kinds  of  nature,  “ā***yūhana***  (endeavouring)”  etc,  resulting  in designating as ***sacca*** (Truth) consequently. 

**9.16.C. Four kinds of meaning of *nirodha sacca*** 

\1.  ***nissara***ṇ***aṭṭha***  \_\_\_\_\_  After  attaining  the  object  of  ***nibbāna***  in  the continuum of Noble Ones, those Noble Ones who knows and sees ***nibbāna*** can release from rounds of rebirth, due to presence of the object called this ***nibbāna***. Due to occurrence 

**PAGE-506** 

` `of  cause  of  releasing  from  rounds  of  rebirth,  that  ***nibbāna***  is  designated  as ‘‘***nissara***ṇ***a***’’. In the next method \_\_\_\_\_ 

Due  to  occurrence  of  abandoning  of  these  all  kinds  of  ground  ***dhammas*** (***upādhidhamma***), due to occurrence of place of abandoning of all kinds of ground ***dhammas***; due to absence of all kinds of ground ***dhammas***, to wit, 

1. fivefold sensual objects called ‘‘***kāmupadhi***,’’ 
1. five aggregates called ‘‘***khandhupadhi***,’’ 
1. ten defilements called ‘‘***kilesupadhi***,’’ 
1. accumulation of ***kamma*** which can provide to give rise to aggregates of 

new existence called ‘‘***abhisaṅkhārupadhi***,’’ 

***nibbānam***, itself, is releasing from all kinds of conditioned things (***saṅkhata dhamma***).  It  never  associates  with  ***saṅkhata  dhamma***.  Due  to  presence  of  the meaning that is the occurrence of capable of releasing from all kinds of ***saṅkhata dhamma***, that ***nibbāna*** is called “***nissara***ṇ***a***”. In the next method \_\_\_\_\_ 

Due to presence of efficiency of relation of object (***āramma***ṇ***apaccaya***) of the Unconditioned element called ***nibbāna***, The Noble Path-Knowledge which is capable of  taking  object  of  that  ***nibbāna***,  eradicates  defilements  step  by  step.  Due  to eradication of defilements without any remains, those actions (***kamma***), which are able to give rise to result only in the presence of association of defilement, has no opportunity to give rise to resultant ***dhamma***, resulting in impossibility of occurrence of consequence five aggregates. All kinds of ground ***dhamma*** (***upadhis***) are ceased consequently. The Unconditioned, ***nibbāna***, therefore, is the fundamental cause of deliverance of all kinds of ground ***dhammas***. The nature of occurrence of fundamental cause of deliverance of all kinds of ground ***dhammas***, is the meaning of ***nissaranattha*** of ***nirodha sacca***. 

***Pali Quotation*** (***Mūla***ṭī***-2-50***) 

`    `(***Mahāṭī-1-257***) 

This meaning of releasing called ‘‘***nissara***ṇ***a***’’ is acquired specific nature that occurs apparently without regarding to any other Truths. 

2. ***Vivekaṭṭha*** \_\_\_\_\_ That nature of void of craving, and origin (***samudaya***) 

is the meaning of ***vivekaṭṭha*** of ***nirodha sacca***. Due to void of craving, that action (***kamma***), which can give rise to result in the presence of association of craving, is also  wanting.  Due  to  lack  of  action-defilement,  those  conditioned  things  of consequence round (***vipākavaṭṭa)*** are also void. The nature of void from all kinds of conditioned things (***saṅkhāra*** ***dhamma***) without associating with these conditioned things is the meaning of ***vivekaṭṭha*** of ***nirodha sacca***. 

Due to occurrence of cause of finishing of craving, ***nirodha sacca*** is void from origin (***samudaya***) called craving. It is also void from the processes of arising and 

**PAGE-507** 

passing away of conditioned things. Therefore the meaning of ***vivekaṭṭha*** of ***nirodha sacca*** is a kind of meaning which becomes apparent due to knowing and seeing on origin (***samudaya***) and conditioned things which are not void (***viveka***), by means of ***asammoha paṭivedha*** of the Noble Path. 

3. ***asaṅkhataṭṭha***  \_\_\_\_\_  The  nature  of  occurrence  which  is  not  worth 

preparing  or  conditioning  by  any  kind  of  conditions  called  ignorance,  craving, clinging, ***kamma***-formations, action etc, is called the meaning of ***a-saṅkhaaṭṭha*** of ***nirodha  sacca***.  Even  the  Noble  Path  is  the  ***dhamma***  with  cause  (***sappaccaya dhamma***) in the presence of determinative dependence (***upanissaya***) of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge. It is also ***saṅkhata dhamma*** which can arise only when causal ***dhamma***s are available. Even the Noble Path is unavoidable from the nature of ***sappaccaya*** and ***saṅkhata***. Due to seeing the occurrence of conditioned thing called the Noble Path the meaning of ***asaṅkhata*** of ***nirodha sacca*** becomes apparent. It means that the nature of The Unconditioned occurrence of ***nirodha sacca*** becomes apparent with regarding to the conditioned occurrence of ***magga sacca***. 

4. ***amataṭṭha***  \_\_\_\_\_  Due  to  presence  of  permanent  nature  of  ***nibbāna*** 

called ***nirodha sacca***, in other words, \_\_\_\_\_ due to occurrence of ***nibbāna*** called ***nirodha sacca***, in other words, \_\_\_\_\_ due to occurrence of deathless one without dissolution is called the meaning of ‘***amatattha***’ of ***nirodha*** ***sacca***. 

Due to knowing and seeing on conditioned things, ***dukkha sacca***, which are always perishing away with the nature of death, the nature of ***nibbāna, nirodha sacca*** which is lacking nature of death, becomes apparant. Conditioned things which are being discerned in the stage of ***vipassanā*** practice, belongs to the field of perishing away, and field of death. At the end of the field of death, the Unconditioned element, which appears apparently in the Noble Path-Knowledge, is the field without perishing away and death indeed. It means that the nature of The Unconditioned element called ***nibbāna*** becomes apparent with regarding to the nature of death of conditioned things. 

These four kinds of meaning of “***nirodha sacca***” are true but not false, not wrong. Those ***dhammas*** belong to “***nirodha sacca***” never arise through any other natures,  except  four  kinds  of  nature,  “***nissara***ṇ***a***  (releasing)”  etc,  resulting  in designating as ***sacca*** (Truth) consequently.

In another method \_\_\_\_\_ The Noble ***dhamma*** called ***nibbāna*** is designated as not only ***“vivekaṭṭha”*** (= the nature of void of origin and craving), due to occurrence of loss of origin and craving, but also “***asaṅkhaṭṭha***” (= the nature without causes called ignorance, craving, clinging, ***kamma***-formations, action etc, and ***“amataṭṭha***,***”*** which lacks the nature of perishing away. (***Mūla***ṭī***-2-50***) 

**9.16.D. Four kinds of meaning of *magga sacca*** 

1. ***niyyānaṭṭha*** \_\_\_\_\_ The nature of occurrence of cause of deliverance 

from  suffering  of  rounds  of  rebirth  of  ***magga  sacca***  is  called  the  meaning  of ***niyyānaṭṭha***. This is obvious nature through specific function of that ***magga sacca*** indeed. While ***vipassanā*** practice is performing by taking the object of process of perishing away of ***saṅkhata*** ***dhamma***, The Noble Path-Knowledge that arises at the apex of ***Vipassanā***  

**PAGE-508** 

Knowledge, can take the object of the Unconditioned element peaceful ***nibbāna***, as object. The Noble Path-Knowledge, therefore, is the cause of deliverance from the field of dissolution. It is the nature of ***niyyānaṭṭha***, indeed. When the Noble Path- Knowledge takes the object of the Unconditioned element which lacks any kind of dissolution,  the  fire  of  underlying  tendency  element,  which  are  underlying  on  the continuity of corporeality and mentality, are finished off successively due to presence of tranquillity and peace the Unconditioned element. Due to finishing of defilements, 

potentiality of action (***kamma***) are also finished successively resulting in sequence of cessation  of  continuity  of  consequence  aggregates.  The  sequential  cessation  of continuity  of  consequence  aggregates  is  sequential  deliverance  from  suffering  of rounds of rebirth. Because deliverance from rounds of rebirth is invaluable resultant ***dhamma*** produced by the Noble Path-Knowledge the latter is designated as ***niyyāna dhamma*** (cause of deliverance). 

This  nature  of  ***niyyānaṭṭha***,  becomes  apparent  through  specific  function  of itself, that is eradication of respective defilements of that ***magga sacca***. 

2. ***hetuṭṭha***  (=  ***hetvaṭṭha***)  \_\_\_\_\_\_  The  nature  of  occurrence  of  cause  to 

attain ***nibbāna*** is the meaning of ***hetuṭṭha*** of ***magga sacca***. 

***Pali Quotation (Mūla***ṭī ***- 2- 50, 51)*** 

***(Anuti-2-61) ( Mahāṭī-1-257)*** 

Only  when  the  Noble  Path  arises  apparently  by  taking  the  object  of  the Unconditioned  element,  ***nibbāna***,  as  object,  the  former  can  eradicate  in  sequence underlying  tendencies  of  defilements  called  ***samudaya  sacca***  that  is  capable  of impeding  the  Noble  Path.  The  sequential  finishing  of  underlying  tendencies  of defilements is called ***kilesa parinibbāna*** (= release from cravings and attachement to life, emancipation (in  this life) with the assurance of final death). It is called the attainment of ***saupādisesa*** ***nibbāna*** extinction (of passion) with some substratum left.) Due to sequential finishing of defilements, the potentiality of actions (***kamma***) which can  give  rise  to  resultant  ***dhammas***  in  presence  of  defilements,  are  also  lost  in sequence. Due to loss of potentiality of actions (***kamma***), consequence aggregates (***Vipākakhandh***ā) finished off in sequence. Finally when The Noble Path of Arahant is  attained  all  kinds  of  defilements  are  eradicated  without  any  remains.  Due  to finishing of all defilements without any remains, five aggregates cease by means of ***anuppāda*** ***nirodha*** (= complete extinction of ***khandha*** life, i.e., all possibility of such life and its rebirth, final release from (the misery of) rebirth and transmigration, death after  The  last  life  -  span  of  an  Arahant.  It  is  called  entering  into  ***“Khandha parinibbāna”*** or attaining ***“aupādisesa*** ***nibbāna*** ***dhātu”***. Because the opportunity of both  facing  with  the  Unconditioned  element,  ***nibbāna***  and  attaining  ***saupādisesa*** ***nibbāna*** ***dhātu*** and ***aupādisesa*** ***nibbāna*** ***dhātu*** can be occurred by the Noble Path only,  the  Noble  Path  ***dhamma***  called  ***magga  sacca***  is  the  fundamental  cause  of attaining of ***nibbāna***, called the meaning of ***“hetu***.***”*** 

Thus the nature of ‘***hetu***’ of ***magga sacca*** become apparent with regarding to the nature of ***samudaya sacca***. Due to knowing and seeing on ***“samudaya sacca”*** called 

**PAGE-509** 

the craving that is fundamental cause of ***dukkha*** ***sacca*** but not the cause of attainment of  ***nibbāna***,  the  nature  of  fundamental  cause  of  attainment  of  ***nibbāna***  called  the meaning of ***hetuṭṭha*** of ***magga sacca***, becomes apparent consequently. 

3. ***dassanaṭṭha*** \_\_\_\_\_ Due to occurrence of presence of significance of 

wisdom (***paññ***ā) called ***sammādiṭṭhi*** (Right View) of ***magga*** ***sacca***, Noble Eightfold 

Path, the nature of capable of seeing on the Unconditioned element, ***nibbāna***; in the next method \_\_\_\_\_ the nature of occurrence with ability to see on the Unconditioned element, ***nibbāna***, in the next method \_\_\_\_\_ the nature of facing with subtler and subtler Unconditioned element, ***nibbāna*** really, is the meaning of ***“dassanaṭṭha”*** of ***magga  sacca***.  Due  to  presence  of  ability  to  see  on  very  profound  and  subtle Unconditioned element, ***nibbāna*** really, the nature of ***dassanaṭṭha*** of ***magga sacca*** becomes apparent through seeing on that ***nirodha sacca***. (If means that due to seeing on ***dhamma*** which is worth seeing, ***dhamma*** which is capable of seeing, becomes apparent with regarding to the former ***dhamma***.) 

4. ***adhipateyyaṭṭha*** \_\_\_\_\_ The nature of occurrence of chief in knowing 

and  seeing  on  Four  Noble  Truths,  and  in  making  to  end  worries  of  suffering  of defilements, is the meaning of ***adhipateyyaṭṭha*** of ***magga sacca***. 

According to the tetrad method (***catukkanaya***), The arising consciousness of the Path (-moment) consists of (37) kinds of mind and mental concomitants, if it arises through the first absorption, while (35) kinds of mind and mental concomitants, if it arises  through  the  second  absorption;  (34)  kinds,  including  agreeable  feeling (***sukhavedan***ā) and (34)kinds, including neutrality feeling but not agreeable feeling, of mind and mental concomitants each, if it arises through the third absorption and the fourth absorption respectively. Those bases of factors of Path consisting in that arising consciousness of the Path (-moment) are designated as ***magga sacca***. Those bases of factors of path called ***magga sacca***, are capable of functioning of both knowing and seeing on Four Noble Truths and finishing off great worries of defilements through an occurrence as chief of associating ***dhammas***. 

That occurrence of chief, therefore, is called the meaning of ***adhipateyyaṭṭha*** of ***magga sacca***. 

In  next  method  \_\_\_\_\_  Due  to  preaching  as  ***“maggādhipatino  dhammā”***, factors of Path are more significant ***dhammas*** of relation of objective predominance (***āramma***ṇ***adhipati  paccaya***),  rather  than  other  associating  mental  ***dhammas***. Therefore the nature of occurrence of relation of objective predominance of those factors of Path is designated as the meaning of ***“adhipateyyaṭṭha***.***”*** 

As  nobility  of  an  officer  who  lacks  any  kind  of  disease  becomes  apparent through seeing on a poor person who is oppressed by many diseases, the occurrence of chief of ***magga sacca*** becomes apparent through seeing on suffering ***dhammas*** of ***dukkha sacca***. 

These four kinds  of meaning of “***magga sacca***” are true but not false, not wrong.  Those  ***dhammas***  belong  to  “***magga  sacca***”  never  arise  through  any  other natures,  except  four  kinds  of  nature,  “***niyyīnaṭṭha***  (deliverance)”  etc,  resulting  in designating as ***sacca*** (Truth) consequently. 

It should be taken commonly as a single nature of Absolute Truth of Four Noble Truths through these (16) modes of real nature without any false. Such (16) modes of meanings are worth taking a single nature of Absolute Truth. Those (16) modes of meanings, which are taken commonly as a single nature of Absolute Truth, are designated as the nature of ***ekatta*** (oneness) that is the same occurrence of the Four Noble Truths. 

**PAGE-510** 

There is a such nature of ***ekatta*** (oneness). That nature of ***ekatta*** is known by the Path- Knowledge penetratively. Four Noble Truths, therefore, are having the nature which is worth knowing simultaneously by a single Path-Knowledge through oneness nature called Absolute Truth of (16) modes. 

These (16) kinds of meaning of Four Noble Truths are extracted from ***Paṭisam- 296, Abhi-A-2-78, Vs-2-332, Mūla***ṭī***-2-50, 51, Mahāṭī-1-257***. 

***Ekapaṭivedhadassan***a \_\_\_\_\_ Although The Noble Path Knowledge takes the object of ***nibbāna*** only, such meaning of Turth (***saccaṭṭha***) that is called the Absolute Truth of, the Ultimate Truth of, the Real Occurrence of ***dukkha sacca*** etc, is present, and that meaning of Truth is also known by the Noble Path - Knowledge through ***a- sammohapaṭivedha*** (= penetrative knowing without infatuation) after destroying on delusion which is concealing on that nature of urth. (It means that due to finishing to destroy the delusion that is concealing on meanings of truths, those meanings of turths have been known by practical knowledge (***paccakkha ñāṇa***). Due to occurrence of penetrative knowing and facing with in that way, later periods after the Noble Path- Knowledge has arisen, (16) kinds of meanings of truths always appear apparently in the insight of Noble One as purified ruby showing on the palm, in other words, as a bael fruit, ***Aegle marmelos***, putting in the hand. (***Mahāṭī-2-505***) 

**E. Reasonable interrogative facts** 

There is a reasonable question that why four kinds of meanings only  were preached even though many other kinds of meanings, the occurrence of the same as disease, the occurrence of the same as open sore, etc, other than those meanings, ‘***p***īļ***ana***’,  ***saṅkhata***  etc,  of  ***dukkha***  ***sacca***  and  ***samudaya  sacca***.  The  answer  is  as follows: \_\_\_\_\_ 

Due to occurrence of obvious nature by means of seeing on other Truths, Only four kinds of Truthswere preached. It is right \_\_\_\_\_ . 

***Pali Quotation (Vibharga-341, Paṭisam-114)*** 

- Among those, which is the knowledge arising on ***dukkha*** ***sacca***? Such reason 

which is arising by taking the object of ***dukkha sacca*** possesses such distinguishable recognition. 

***(Vibhanga - 341, Paṭisam - 114)*** 

By means of taking the object of each Truth (***sacca***), The Knowledge of Object (***saccañāṇa***) is preached through this way etc. 

***Pali Quotation (Sam-3-382)*** 

- *Bhikkhus*… a such *bhikkhu* sees ***dukkha sacca***, that *bhikkhu* sees ***samudaya*** 

***sacca*** also. (***Sam-3-382***) 

By means of finishing The function to known remaining three kinds of Truths, by faking The object of any kind of Truths, the Knowledge of Object (***saccañāṇa***) is preached through this way etc. (***Vs - 2- 333***) 

In  those  two  kinds  of  preaching  methodologies,  penetrative  knowing  and seeing on Four Noble Truths, by means of finishing the function to know through asammoha ***paṭvedha***, is similar to the ***“***seeing***”*** due to obvious occurrence. In the commentary, it is continued to explain in this way, by reasoning of seeing on each Truth specifically without reasoning of seeing by mean of finishing the function to know in that way. (***Mah***āṭī ***-2-505***) 

In those two kinds of preaching methodologies, for such time, each specific Truth  is  taken  into  heart  as  object.  At  That  time  due  to  knowing  and  seeing  on ***samudaya sacca***, the nature of ***saṅkhata*** of ***dukkha sacca*** with the nature of ***p***īļ***ana*** also becomes apparent. Why is it apparent? 

By means of extreme desire to that ***dukkha sacca***, The Noble Truth called ***samudaya sacca***, which has the nature of cause to arise sufferings, and the nature of endeavouring for occurrence of ***dukkha sacca***, called ***“āyūhana lakkha***ṇ***a”***, causes groups  of  ***dukkha  sacca***  all  together,  as  corporeal  and  mental  units  (***rūpakalāpa, nāmakalāpa***).  It  is  right  \_\_\_\_\_\_  Any  kind  of  resultant  ***dhamma***  called ***paccayuppaññā***  arises  randomly.  It  is  a  fixed  natural  law  that  those  all  kinds  of resultant ***dhammas*** always arise as group commonly. Those resultant ***dhammas*** are worth  preparing  co-operatively  by  other  causes,  ***gati***  (existence),  ***upadhi***  (forceful personality), ***kāla*** (time), ***payoga*** (exerting by oneself) but not ***samudaya*** alone.  

Groups of corporealities and mentalities called corporeal units and mental units are  worth  producing  all  together.  It  is  right.  \_\_\_\_\_  When  numerous  resultant ***dhammas***  called  ***“paccayuppaññā”***  within  same  corporeal  unit,  mental  unit,  arise synchronously in one mind moment it is resulting from co - operative performance of respective cause of themselves. Due to occurrence of capable of producing resultant ***dhammas***, ***dukkha*** ***sacca*** all together by ***samudaya sacca*** in that way, that nature of ***saṅkhata*** of that ***dukkha sacca*** becomes apparent. (***Vs-2 -33***) 

Then due to ability to remove worries called defilements resulting in lacking from any kind of defilement itself, ***magga sacca*** is very calm and peaceful. Therefore due to seeing on ***magga sacca***, the nature of ***santāpa*** (= great worries) of that ***dukkha sacca*** become apparent. It is similar to what a way that due to seeing on the beauty of female  celestial  being,  the  occurrence  of  ugliness  of  princess  ***Janapadakalayāni*** called ***Sundari*** becomes apparent as an old female monkey for ***Venerable Nanda***, The younger brother of the ***Buddha***. (***Vs-2-333***) 

Furthermore, due to seeing on the Unconditioned element ‘***nibbāna***’, ***nirodha sacca***, which has the nature of permanence but not change and alteration, the nature of change and alteration (***vipari***ṇā***ma***), which is changing to the nature of aging and dissolution of that ***dukkha sacca***, just after arising phase (***uppāda***), becomes apparent. Thus it is not need to say any more the reasonable fact that due to seeing on ***nirodha sacca***, the nature of ***“vipari***ṇā***maṭṭha”*** (= change and alteration) of ***dukkha sacca*** becomes apparent as a result of contrast between their nature is very marked. (***Vs-2- 333***) 

Furthermore, due to seeing on ***dukkha sacca***, the nature of ***nidānaṭṭha*** (source) of  ***samudaya  sacca***  with  acquired  nature  of  ***ayūhana***  (endeavouring)  becomes apparent in a way that ***“***this ***samudaya sacca*** can make over that ***dukkha sacca***.***”*** It should be recognized as an the occurrence of source of disease of nourishment is obvious due to seeing on arising of disease through taking unfavourable nourishment. (***Vs - 2- 333***) 

**PAGE-512** 

Due  to  seeing  on  ‘***nirodha  sacca***’,  which  occurs  without  associating  with suffering of rounds of rebirth, the nature of association with suffering of defilement of ***samudaya sacca*** become apparent. Due to seeing on ***magga sacca*** which is the cause of deliverance from rounds of rebirth, the nature of impediment of ***samudaya sacca***, by tying and oppressing in the lock - up or prison of rounds of rebirth, becomes apparent. (***Vs-2-333***). 

Furthermore  due  to  seeing  on  ***“samudaya  sacca”***,  which  always  lacks  of quiescence  by  means  of  unfailing  associating  with  defilements,  the  nature  of ***vivekaṭṭha***  (seclusion),  which  is  void  of  four  kinds  of  ground  (***upadhi***),  of ***nirodhasacca*** with the nature of ***nissara***ṇ***a*** (deliverance), becomes apparent. Due to seeing on ***magga sacca***, the nature of ***asaṅkhaṭṭha*** (unconditioned) of ***nirodhasacca*** become apparent. It is right. \_\_\_\_\_ The practising ***meditator*** has never seen the Noble path,  ***magga  sacca***,  previously  for  very  long  infinite  rounds  of  rebirth.  Although unexperienced Noble Path occurs with marvelous nature which has never seen in very long  infinite  rounds  of  rebirth,  it  can  occur  only  when  the  supporting  factors  of efficiency  of  determinative  dependence  of  successive  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  are available, resulting in occurrence of ***magga sacca*** as ***sappaccaya*** ***dhamma*** ( = with cause)  only.  After  seeing  on  ***magga  sacca***  with  that  nature  called  ***saṅkhata***,  the Unconditioned element, ***nibbāna*** without any cause (***appaccayadhamma***), becomes apparent. Then due to seeing on ***dukkha sacca***, the nature of ***amataṭṭha*** (deathless) of ***nirodhasacca***, which lacks the nature of dissolution, becomes apparent. It is right \_\_\_\_\_ Due to presence of occurrence of the nature of dissolution and death, ***dukkha sacca*** is similar to poision. The Noble ***dhamma*** called ***nibbāna***, which is the same as the medicine of ***dukkha sacca*** with poisionous nature, become as ***“***panacea***”*** which leads to deethless state. It will be apparent in this way. (***Vs-2-33***) 

Furthermore, due to ***“samudaya sacca”*** is known and seen in a way, that is explained in the stage of ***maggāmaggañāṇa dessana visuddhi*** as  ***“***this ***samudaya sacca*** is not the cause of reaching to ***“nibbāna***”, this Noble Path only is the cause of reaching of ***nibbāna***,***”*** although the desire (***nikanti***) which is worth reaching to praise as the Noble Path, arises quiescently in the stage of Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away (***udayabbayañāṇa***), the nature of ***hetuṭṭha*** (= cause of reaching to ***nibbāna***) of ***magga sacca*** with acquired nature of ***niyyān***a (= releasing from rounds of rebirth, becomes  apparent.  Due  to  seeing  on  very  subtle  ***nirodha  sacca***,  the  nature  of ***dassanaṭṭha***, i.e, an occurrence of capable of seeing on the Unconditioned element ***nibbāna***, of ***magga sacca***, becomes apparent. It is similar to the fact that for a person who sees very subtle visible objects, the occurrence of clearness of the eye - clear - sensitivity  becomes  apparent  as  ***“***my  eye-clear-  sensitivity  is  very  clear.***”***  Due  to seeing on ***dukkha sacca*** with great faults of capable of reaching to great worries, the nature of ***adhipateyyaṭṭha***, i.e., an contrast occurrence of chief to finish off fire of defilements and to see Four Noble Truths, of ***magga sacca*** becomes apparent. It is similar to the fact that due to seeing a poor with great pains and diseases, the noble occurrence of a kingship with great wealth and attendants, becomes apparent. (***Vs-2- 333,334***) 

**PAGE-513** 

Thus, due to obvious occurrence of These Four Noble Truths, i.e., each nature called  ***p***īļ***anaṭṭha***,  ***āyūhanaṭṭha***,  ***nissara***ṇ***aṭṭha***,  ***niyyānaṭṭha***,  by  means  of  specific nature  of  respective  Truth  and  remaining  three  kinds  of  nature  other  than  these specific kinds of nature called ***p***īļ***anaṭṭha***, ***āyūhanaṭṭha***, ***nissara***ṇ***aṭṭha***, ***niyyānaṭṭha***, by means of seeing on other each kind of Truths, Four kinds of meaning of each Truth are preached in detail. It should be recognized the fact that at The Noble path (- moment), all kinds of those (16) nature are known and seen penetratively by single Noble  Path-Knowledge  which  achieves  four  functions  on  Four  Noble  Truths simultaneously. (***Vs -2-334***) 

17. **A *Pariññābhisamaya* (realization by full understanding)** 

There are three kinds of ***pariññā*** (full understanding) , i.e, 

1. ***ñātapariññā*** = full understanding on objects  
1. ***tīra***ṇ***apariññā***  =  full  understanding  on  propagation  of  ***Vipassanā*** 

Knowledge 

3. ***pahānapariññā  =  full  understanding  on  abandoning  of  conditioned 

things. 

1. ***ñātapariññā***  \_\_\_\_  ***tassa  sappaccayanāmarūpabhijananā  ***āve***ṇ***ikā 

***bhūmi***. (***Vs-2-334***) 

The  Knowledge  of  Analysing  Mentality  and  Corporeality  (***nāmarūpa pariccheda ñāṇa***) and the Knowledge of Discerning Cause and Condition (***paccaya pariggahañāṇa***),  which  are  capable  of  knowing  and  seeing  on  mentality  and corporeality together with causal ***dhammas*** penetratively up to the field of ultimate reality,  are  the  specific  sphere  (***bhūmi***)  of  full  understanding  on  objects (***ñātapariññ***ā), due to concerning to none of ***pariññās*** other than ***ñātapariññ***ā. those are standing and occurring as the sphere of that ***ñātapariññā***, indeed. (***Vs - 2- 334***) 

2. ***tīra***ṇ***apariññā*** \_\_\_\_\_ ***Parli Quotation (Vs-2-334)*** 

The  stages  of  ***Vipassanā***,  from  the  beginning  of  ***nayavipassanā***  called ***kalāpasammasana*** till the Knowledge of Adaptation, which are occurring by means of having reasoned deductively  and scrutinizing as ***anicca, dukkha, anatta*** on all kinds of conditioned things together with causal ***dhammas***, are the specific sphere (***bhūmi***)  of  that  ***tīra***ṇ***apariññā***  (full  understanding  on  propagation  of   ***vipassanā*** practice). Those are standing and occurring as the sphere of that ***tīra***ṇ***apariññ***ā. (***Vs - 2 - 334***) 

Even the knowledge of Adaptation arises by taking the object of conditioned things through impermanence (***anicca***) etc. There is nothing to say for those preceding ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, the Knowledge of Reflection (***paṭisankhāñāṇa***) with object of conditioned things, etc. Therefore it is designated as the sphere of ***tīra***ṇ***apariññā*** up to the Knowledge of Adaptation. There is a reasonable question that both ***ñātapariññā*** and  ***tīra***ṇ***apariññā***  are  also  worth  designating  in  this  sphere  of  ***tīra***ṇ***apariññā***, however although both ***ñātapariññā*** is worth getting,  due to discerning by taking objects  of  corporealities  and  mentalities  together  with  causal  ***dhammas***  and ***pahānapariññā***  is  also  worth  getting,  due  to  distinguishing  on  phenomena  of impermanence,  suffering,  non  -  self  of  conditioned  things  after  abandoning defilements  temporarily,  these  two  kinds  of  full  understanding  (***pariññ***ā)  cannot perform significantly the functions of reasoning and scrutinizing on phenomena of impermanence, suffering, non - self of conditioned things as ***ñātapariññā*** does, with the  result  that  it  says  that  these  are  the  specific  sphere  (***ave***ṇ***ikabhūmi***)  of ***tīra***ṇ***apariññ***ā. (***Mahāṭī-2-507***) 

**PAGE-514** 

3. ***pahānapariññā*** \_\_\_\_\_ ***Pali Quotation (Vs-2-335)*** 

***Vipassanā***  practices  performing  from  the  Knowledge  of  Dissolution (***bhanganupassanāñāṇa***) to the Noble Path-Knowledge are designated as the sphere of ***pahānapariññā*** (= full understanding on abandoning of conditioned things). Due to penetrative distinguishing on both phenomena of impermanence, suffering, non-self of conditioned  things  through  ***asammoha  paṭvedha***,  and  the  Uncoditioned  element, ***nibbāna***  through  ***āramma***ṇ***a***  ***paṭvedha***,  the  Noble  Path-Knowledge  only  is  worth designating as ***pahānapariññā***, directly. When analysing on penetrative knowing on ***dukkha  sacca***  through  the  function  of  ***pahānabhisamaya***  of  the Noble  Ones,  this ***pahānapariññā***  only  is  essential  to  designate  really.  If  means  that  the  nature  of ***dukkha sacca*** is known through ***pahānapariññābhisamaya***, which is so - called ***a- sammohapaṭvedha*** (= penetrative knowing and seeing without infatuation). It is due to  occurrence  of  beneficial  result  called  ***pahānapariññā***  of  ***ñātapariññā***  and ***tīra***ṇ***apariññ***ā. It means that two kinds of preceding full understanding, ***ñātapariññā*** and ***tīra***ṇ***apariññā***, are carried out for attainment of ***pahānapariññā*** only. (Vs-2-335, ***Mahāṭī-2-507, 508***) 

In other words, \_\_\_\_ Both ***ñātapariññā*** and ***tīra***ṇ***apariññā*** are also beneficial result called that ***pahānapariññā*** only (= eradication of defilements = attainment of the Noble Path). It is right.\_\_\_\_\_ Those two kinds of full understanding occur in order to give rise to the Noble Path only. Then such ***dhammas*** are abandoned, and then it is natural fixed occurrence that those ***dhammas*** are both ***ñāta dhamma*** (= the ***dhamma*** which has been known thoroughly) and ***tīritadhamma*** (= the ***dhamma*** which has been scrutinized and reasoned inductively by generalizing on three general characters). All three  kinds  of  full  understanding,  therefore,  are  the  function  of  the  Noble  Path- Knowledge only indirectly. It is because of the facts as follows. \_\_\_\_\_ 

It is explained that ***“***such ***dhammas*** are abandoned, and then it is natural fixed occurrence that those ***dhammas*** are both ***ñātadhamma*** (= the ***dhamma*** which has been  known  thoroughly)  and  ***tīritadhamma***  (=  the  ***dhamma***  which  has  been scrutinized and reasoned inductively by generalizing on  three general characters)***”*** because  both  ***pahānapariññā***  can  not  occur  in  the  absence  of  ***ñātapariññā***  and ***tīra***ṇ***apariññā***,  and  as  if  the  function  of  ***pahānapariññā***  is  finished,  that  of ***ñātapariññā*** and ***tīra***ṇ***apariññā*** are also finished. It is right. \_\_\_\_\_ It can be said that when the Noble Path-Knowledge arise through ***pariññābhisamaya*** of ***dukkha sacca***, it knows penetratively specific characters of each ultimate element, five aggregates clinging to existence (***upādānakkhandha***) called ***dukkha sacca***, as well as general characters called ***anicca***, ***dukkha***, ***anatta*** of those ultimate elements respectively. It is because  the  Noble  Path-Knowledge  has  eradicated  delusion  which  is  capable  of concealing on specific and general characters of those ultimate elements, not to be known,  through  relinguishing  by  extirpation  (***samuccheda  pahāna***).  It  should  be understood that all three kinds of full understanding, therefore, are the function of the Noble Path-Knowledge only indirectly. (***Vs - 2- 334,335; Mahāṭī-2-507, 508***)

**9.17.B *Pahānabhisamaya* ( = realization through abandonment)** 

There are three kinds of abandonment (***pahāna***) concerning with abandoning of defilements, viz, 

1. ***vikkhambhanappahāna*** (abandonment with a moderate duration) 
1. ***tadangappahāna*** (abandonment with temporariness) 
1. ***samucchedappahāna*** (abandonment by extirpation). 

**B.1  *vikkhambhanapahāna***\_\_\_\_\_  Among  those  three  kinds,  as  spreading  out  of duckweeds due to putting of earthen pot into water with duckweeds, the abandonment with a moderate duration of opposite ***dhammas***, hindrance ... etc, by the mundane concentration  of  various  absorptions,  is  designated  as  ***vikkhambhana***  ***pahāna***. Hindrance of desire to sensual pleasure (***kamacchandanīvara***ṇ***a***) etc, are not stood in the  continuity  of  mind  and  mental  concomitant  by  means  of  out  bursting  nature (***pariyuṭṭhāna***) and the mind is not oppressed by those hindrances etc, through such mode.  Performance  of  prohibiting  not  to  be  oppressed  by  that  mode  is  called ***vikkhambhana***  (abandonment).  That  abandonment  can  be  said  as  ***“***a  kind  of relinquishing  (***pahāna***),  resulting  in  designated  as  ***vikkhambhana  pahāna*** (abandonment  with  a  moderate  duration).  It  can  be  found  in  Pali  Text  as follows.\_\_\_\_\_ 

***vikkhambhanapphāneñca nīvara***ṇā***nam jhānam bhāvayato***. (***Paṭisam***- ***26***) 

- ***“***and abandonment (***pahāna***) called relinquishing of defilements of a person 

who develops the first absorption***”***... (***Paṭisam* - 26**) 

Relinquishig of hindrances ***dhammas*** only has been preached through this way etc.  It  should  be  recognized  the  fact  that  kind  of  preaching  is  performed  due  to obvious occurrence in others also, such as, “this person has the consciousness that is not  suppressed  by  anger  and  lacking  in  sloth  and  torpor,”  etc.  It  is  right,  \_\_\_\_\_ Hindrances are unaable to supress immediately the mind of practice both before and after  the  absorption.  Initial  application,  sustained  application,  pleasurable  interest, agreeable  feeling,  perception  of  form  (***rūpasaññ***ā)  etc.,  are  removed  during  the moment, entering into the second, third, fourth absorptions etc. Although those are removed in that way, they (***hindances***) can arise in the continuum of a person who just emerges  from  various  absorptions,  the  second  absorption  ...  etc.  This  is  because emerging from absorption can be achieved through the consciousness of sensuous sphere (= only when consciousness of sensuous sphere arises). (***Vs-2-335, Mahāṭī-2- 508***) 

It is explained the words,***”*** hindrances are unable to suppress immediately the mind of practice both before and after the absorption,***”*** by means of just acquired absorption  only.  For  a  person  with  well  developed  and  proficient  absorption (***pagunajhāna***),  hindrances  ***dhammas***  are  unable  to  suppress  until  last  death- consciousness. In other words \_\_\_\_\_ it should be recognized the fact that both former part of practice (***pubbabhāgapaṭipad***ā) that is a period before absorption and during 

endeavouring to attain absorption, and in the continuum of a person who is busy with various  social  dealings,  hindrances  are  unable  to  suppress  the  mind  immediately. (***Mahāṭī-2-508***)

**B. 2. (1) *tadangappahāna*** \_\_\_\_\_ As the cloud of darkness disappears at night due to lighting  on  open  oil  lamp,  abandoning  of  various  ***dhammas***,  which  are  worth abandoning by means of opposite nature of causal ***dhamma*** called various kinds of knowledge that are partial of ***Vipassanā*** practice, is designated as ***tadangapahāna*** (= abandonment with temporariness). (This word can be said in order to show such kind of ***tadangappahāna*** that is reaching into the field of ***vipassanā*** practice. It should be recognized  the  fact  the  various  ***dhammas***,  which  are  worth  abandoning,  can  be abandoned  temporarily  by  purifying  of  virtue  (***sīlavisodhana***)  etc.  (***Vs-2-  335, Mahāṭī-2-508, 509***) 

Previously twenty kinds of wrong views of personality (***sakkāya diṭṭhi***) are abandoned by the Knowledge of Analyzing Mentality and Corporeality (***namarūpa*** ***pariccheda  ñāṇa***).  The  wrong  view  of  ***“***denier  of  a  cause***”***  (***a-hetuka***  ***diṭṭhi***),  the wrong view on creators, such as Brahma, Vishnu, God etc, (***visamahetu***), skeptical doubts which have (16) kinds of standing bases, skeptical doubts on eight kinds of standing bases, are abandoned by the Knowledge of Discerning Cause and Condition (***paccaya pariggahañāṇa***). Wrong perception of Noble Path on false Noble Path is abandoned by the Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away (***udayabbayañāṇa***) which  discriminates the real Path and Not-Path (***magāmagga vavaṭṭhāna***). Wrong view of annihilation (***ucchedadiṭṭhi***) which holds misbelief that ***“***the self (***atta***) is annihilated after death***”***, is abandoned by discerning on the arising (***udaya***) of five aggregates.  Wrong  view  of  eternalism  (***sassatadiṭṭhi***),  which  holds  misbelief  that  ***“***the  self  is eternal and never destroyed,***”*** is abandoned by discerning on the perishing way (***vaya***) of five aggregates. Wrong perception on all conditioned things as ***“***without terror***”*** ( ***a- bhayasaññ***ā)  is  abandoned  by  the  Knowledge  of  Terror  (***bhayatupaṭṭhānaāṇa***). Wrong  perception  on  five  aggregates,  which  arises  by  means  of  pleasurable  ones (***assāda***),  is  abandoned  by  the  Knowledge  of  Danger  (***adīnavanupassanāñāṇa***), which is capable of discerning on dissolution all conditioned things. Wrong perception called ***abhiratisaññā***, which arises by means of extreme desirable ones, is abandoned by the Knowledge of Disenchantment (***nibbidññānupassanāñāṇa***). The situation with non-desire for deliverance is abandoned by the Knowledge of Desire for Deliverance (***muñcitu kamyatāñāṇa***). Delusion (***moha***) which is opposite of the Knowledge of Reflection  (***paṭisankhānupassanāñāṇa***),  is  abandoned  by  the  latter.  The  nature  of non-naturalizing towards conditioned things (***anupekkhanalakkha***ṇ***a***) is abandoned by the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations (***saṅkhārupekkhāñāṇa***). Those obsessions on conditioned things, permanence etc, which are opposite of attainment of ***magga sacca***, are abandoned by the Knowledge of Adaptation (***anulomañāṇa***). This kind  of  abandonment  is  designated  as  ***tadangappahāna***  (abandonment  with temporariness). (***Vs-2-335***)

**PAGE-517** 

` `Endeavouring of volition leading to arising of process of NONE in future, called ***āyūhana***,  is  abandoned  by  ***vayanupassanāñāṇa***  (Knowledge  of  Decay),  which discerns  the  instant  of  the  perishing  phase  of  conditioned  things.  Perception  of stability (***dhuvasaññ***ā) that holds the poinon as ***“***conditioned things are stable,***”*** is abandoned  by  ***vipari***ṇā***mānupassanāñāṇa***  (Knowledge  of  Change  and  Alteration) which discerns on the nature of change to worse of conditioned things through aging (***jar***ā) that is static phase (ṭ***hiti***) and death (***marana***), that is perishing phase (***bhanga***) of conditioned things. 

The obsession of permanence of conditioned things, called ***nicca nimitta*** is abandoned  by  ***animittānupassanāñāṇa***  =  ***aniccānupassanā***  ***ñāṇa***.  Desire  of  bliss (***sukhapa***ṇ***idhi***)  towards  conditioned  things  is  abandoned  by ***appanihitānupassanāñāṇa***  =  ***dukkhānupassanāñāṇa***.  Taking  into  heart  by  wrong way (***attabhinivesa***), as ***“***self (***atta***) is present apparently in the Ultimate sense,***”***... is abandoned by ***suññātānupassanāñāṇa*** = ***anattānupassanāñāṇa***, which is capable of discerning on the nature of void of self of conditioned things. Taking into heart by wrong  way  called  ***sārādānābhinivesa***,  which  is  capable  of  obsessing  on  five aggregates without essence, as ‘essence of permanence, essence of self are present,***”*** is abandoned by ***adhipaññādhamma*** ***vipassanā*** ***ñāṇa***, which scrutinizes the nature of void of self and the nature of nothingness (***suññāta***) by discerning on dissolution of two  kinds  of  ultimate  ***dhammas***,  observed  ***“***conditioned  things***”***  called  ***ñāta***  and observing ***“***conditioned things***”*** called ***ñāṇa***. 

Taking into heart with indecisiveness called ***sammohabhinivesa***, which arises   through wrong believes with sceptical doubts, such as ***“***did I exist in the past?***”***, ... “the world is become by creator (***issara***), such as Brahama, Vishnu, God etc***”*** ... is 

abandoned by ***yathābhūtañāṇadassanāñāṇa*** = ***sappaccayanamarūpapariggahañāṇa*** (Knowledge  of  Analying  Mentality  and  Corporeality,  together  with  Cause  and Condition), which is capable of knowing and seeing on conditioned things as they really are. Taking into heart conditioned things as refuge and taking into heart three kinds  of  realms  as  desirable  ones,  both  kinds  of  ways  of  taking  into  heart  called ***ālayabhinivesa***, are abandoned by ***ādinavānupassanāñāṇa*** (Knowledge of Danger), which discerns disavantage of all kinds of existences, resulting from ***bhayatupaṭṭhāna*** which appears as great terror of conditioned things. It occurs as a result of seeing on none of desirable ***dhammas*** as refuge and protection in (31) realms. Delusion, which is  opposite  of  consideration,  is  abandoned  by  (***paṭisankhānupassanāñāṇa***) (Knowledge  of  Consideration)  called  wisdom  (***paññ***ā)  which  causes  indirectly deliverance from three realms. 

Taking  into  heart  defilements,  such  as  associating  with  sensual  pleasure (***Kāmasamyoga***) etc, called ***abhinivesa***, (= arising of defilements, ***kāmaasamyoga***, etc), is abandoned by ***viva***ṭṭā***nupassanāñāṇa***, which is common usage of Knowledge of  Neutrality,  Towards  Formations  (***saṅkhārupekkhāñāṇa***),  Knowledge  of Adaptation  (***anulomañāṇa***),  which  enters  fastly  into  ***nibbāna***  with  any  cyclic ***dhamma***.  These  ways  of  abandonment  are  called  ***tadangappahāna***  (abandonment with temporariness). (***Vs-2-335, 335***) 

**17.B.3. *Samucchedapahāna*** \_\_\_\_\_\_ Eradication of unwholescrne ***dhammas***, fetter (***samyojana***)  etc,  without  any  remains  through  the  Noble  Path-Knowledge,  as  a thunderstruck  tree  can  not  proliferate  again,  is  designated  as  ***samucchedapahāna*** (abandonment  by  extirpation).  With  regarding  to  that  ***samucchedapahāna***,  it  is preached in The Pali Text, ***Paṭisambhida Magga***, page 27, That ***“***in the continuum of a person 

**PAGE-518** 

who  develops  and  achieves  The  Noble  Path  that  reaches  to  ***nibbāna***,  which  is Supramundane ***dhamma***, which is finishing off all actions and defilements, and all conditioned  things,  The  abandonment  by  extirpation  (***samucchedapahāna***)  occurs simultaneously. (***Vs-2-337***) 

Among  these  three  Kinds  of  abandonment,  in  saying  on  ***abhisamaya***,  as ***“samudaya  sacca***  is  known  through  ***pahānābhisamaya”***,  only  the  third  one, ***samucchedapahāna***, is worth desiring. This is the word said as unchangeable usage (***nippariyāya***) without discursion (***pariyāya***). For the practising ***meditator***, however, previous kinds of abandonment, ***vikkhambhanapahāna*** and ***tadangappahāna*** have the advantageous result called that ***samucchedapahāna***. It means the previous two kinds  of  abandonment  are  fundamental  constituents  of  the  Noble  Path  with ***samucchedapahāna***. This is because in the absence of those two kinds of previous abandonment,  ***vikkhambhanapahāna***  and  ***tadangappahāna***,  the  third  one, ***samucchedapahāna*** can not be accomplished. In other words \_\_\_\_\_ in the continuum of  that  practising  person,  ***vikkhambhanapahāna***,  ***tadangappahāna***,  which  are previous to the Noble Path, have advantageous result called the Noble Path only. Due to that reason, those kinds of abandonment have the function of the Noble Path. It should be recognized that three kinds of abandonment, therefore, are the function of the Noble Path discursively. 

Worldly simile \_\_\_\_\_ A king who becomes kingship after killing on enemy king is worth doing such function of administration which is previous period before kingship. It can be said that function as ***“***this so - called administrative function and so forth  are  worth  doing  for  a  king.***”***  Similarly,  although  ***vikkhambhanapahāna***  and ***tadangappahāna*** are accomplished by mundane ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, it is worth saying  as  the  occurrence  of  function  of  the  Noble  Path  which  arises  through ***samucchedapahāna***.  This  is  because  \_\_\_\_\_  both  the  occurrence  of  presence  of advantage called the Noble Path, of those ***vikkhambhana*** and ***tadangappahāna***, and the occurrence of falling into continuity of mind of ***samatha*** and ***vipassanā*** practices called those ***vikkhambhana***, ***tadanga***, of the Noble Path.

**9.17.C. *Sacchikiriyabhisamaya* (= realization as personal experience)** 

The explanation, ***“***the Noble Path-Knowledge knows penetratively ***nibbāna***, ***nirodha sacca***, through ***sacchikiriyabhisamaya*** (realization by experiencing),***”*** should be recognized in this way. 

There are three kinds of ***sacchikiriya***, to wit, one is mundane kind and two are supramundane kinds, as follows \_\_\_\_\_ 

1. ***lokiya sachikiriya*** = mundane realization as personal experience, 
1. ***lokuttarā***  ***dassan***a***sacchikiriya***  =  Supramundane  realization  as  first 

experience. 

3. ***lokuttarā***  ***bhavanā***  ***sacchikiriya***  =  Supramundane  realization  as 

advanced experience. 

**17. C. 1. *lokiyasacchikiriya*** \_\_\_\_\_\_ Coming and contact with (***phassan***ā) the first absorption etc, such as, ‘I have got the first absorption’, ‘ I have faced with The first absorption,’ is designated as ***lokiya sacchikiriya***. The word, ***phassana***  

**PAGE-519** 

(coming and contact with) means coming and contact of knowledge which can be said that ***“***realization as personal experience,***”*** such as, ***“***I have got this absorption,***”*** after the first absorption etc, has been attained. It is right. \_\_\_\_\_ With referring to this meaning,  after  preaching  in  a  way  that  ...  ***“***the  understanding  (***paññ***ā),  which  is capable of realizing through the meaning of ***“***coming and contact, is designated as the Knowledge  (***ñāṇa***)  (***Paṭisam-2***)***”***,  exegesis  of  realization  as  personal  experience (***sacchikiriyaniddesa***)  has  been  preached  that  ***“***such  various  ***dhammas***  are  worth realizing,  that  various  ***dhammas***  are  worth  coming  and  contact  with  Knowledge (***Paṭisam*** ***-85***),***”*** in similar way. (***Vs-2-338***) 

With regarding to this word, ***paccakkhato*** = ***“***as personal experience,***”*** the way of  taking  the  object  through  hypothetical  reckoning  is  rejected.  Knowing  on  the absorption (***jhāna***) as personal experience by means of reflecting on absorption as ***“***this ***dhamma*** has this kind of nature...***”*** etc, is worth designating as ***“ñāṇaphassa*** = coming and contact with Knowledge,***”*** in this case. (***Mahāṭī-2-510***). 

In another method\_\_\_\_\_ Although absorption, Path and Fruition has not been achieved in the continuum of oneself, such ***dhammas*** are worth Knowing through ***a- prappaccaya  ñāṇa***,  the  knowledge  that  is  not  relying  on  others,  and  then  those ***dhammas*** have been realized as personal experience. It is right. \_\_\_\_\_\_ These kinds of preaching, therefore, as ***“**bhikkhu*s ... all kinds of ***dhammas*** should be realized, *bhikkhu*s ... which all kinds of ***dhammas*** are worth realizing; *bhikkhu*s ... the eye (cakkhu) should be realized,***”*** (***Paṭisam*** - 34) etc. were preached. Furthermore, another kind of preaching, such as ... ***“*** Corporeal ***dhamma*** has, been faced after realizing as personal experience; Feeling ... R ... Perception … R …; ***Kamma***-formations … R …; Consciousness has been faced after realizing as personal experience; the eye (***cakkhu***) ... R .., Aging-death ... R ...; Death-less element ***nibbāna*** has been faced after realizing as  personal  experience.  Such  various  ***dhammas***  have  been  faced;  that  various ***dhammas*** have being come and contact with Knowledge” ... (***Paṭisam*** - 34), is also preached. (***Vs-2 -338***) 

The  Knowledge,  which  occurs  after  attainment  of  the  Path  -  and  Fruit  - Knowledge, which are capable of eradicating on delusion by means of abandoning of infatuation  that  is  capable  of  concealing  on  ***sacchikātabba  dhamma***  (=  those ***dhammas*** which are worth realizing), is designated as ***aprappaccayañāṇa*** due to lack of relying on other. It means that it is actively realizable knowledge but not passively relying on other. (***Phyi-Vs-trans-5-405***) 

According to these explanations, the Knowledge that knows penetratively into mundane  fie  aggregates  of  clinging  to  existence  (***lokiya  pañcupādānakkhandh***ā), twelve bases, eighteen elements, principle of Dependent-Origination. The reflecting Knowledge that reflects. The absorption; and the reflecting Knowledge that reflects Supramundane ***dhammas***, Path, Fruition, ***nibbāna***, are actually ***lokiyasacchikiriya*** (= mundane realization as personal experience). 

2. ***dassanasacchikiriya*** \_\_\_\_\_\_ Seeing on ***nibbāna*** at the Path (-moment) 

of  Upstream-enterer,  is  designated  as  ***“dassanasacchikiriya”***,  that  is  realization through the Path of Upstream-enterer called ***dassan***ā. 

3. ***bhavanā*** ***sacchikiriya*** \_\_\_\_\_ Seeing on ***nibbāna*** at the Path (-moment) 

of  Once-returnee,  the  path  (-moment)  of  Non-returnee,  The  Path  (-moment)  of Arahant, is designated as ***bhāvanāsacchikiriya*** that is realization through Upper Paths called ***bhavanā*** (advanced). 

**PAGE-520** 

In these words of ***abhisamaya*** showing how Noble Ones see ***nirodhasacca*** through  ***sacchikiriyabhisamaya***,  those  two  kinds,  ***dassanasacchikiriya***  and ***bhāvanāsacchikiriya*** are worth desiring. Therefore, it should be recognized the fact that realizing on ***nibbāna***, ***nirodhasacca*** through the Path called ***dassanā*** and the Path called ***bhāvanā*** is designated as the function of this Supramundane Path-Knowledge. (***Vs - 2- 338***) 

Although the Knowledge of Trans-lineage sees ***nibbāna*** earlier than the Path- Knowledge,  it  is  not  worth  designating  as  ***dassana,***  due  to  inability  to  perform eradication of defilements after realizing on ***nibbāna***. Furthermore, with regarding to above words, ***“***realizing on ***nibbāna***, ***nirodhasacca*** through the Path called ***dassana*** 

and the Path called ***bhāvanā***,***”*** the word, ***“*** realizing on ***nibbāna*** through reflecting knowledge,  which  arises  by  means  of  none  of  the  Noble  Path,  is  rejected.  With regarding to the word, ***“***realizing on ***nibbāna*** is worth desiring,***”*** in this case, realizing on the Path and Fruition through reflecting knowledge is rejected. (***Mah***āṭī ***- 2- 511***) 

**9.17.D. *Bhavanā*** ***bhisamaya* (realization as advancement)** 

In  the  word,  the  Noble  Path  knows  penetratively  ***magga  sacca***  through ***bhāvanābhisamaya***, there are two kinds of ***bhāvanā*** (advancement), ***lokiyabhāvanā*** (mundane advancement), ***lokuttarābhāvanā*** (Supramundane advancement). 

**17.D.1. *Lokiyabhāvan***ā** \_\_\_\_\_ Advancement of mundane virtue, concentration and wisdom and instilment of those virtue, concentration and wisdom, into the continuity of corporeality and mentality of one self is designated as ***lokiyabhāvan***ā. 

**17.D.2  *Lokutarābhāvanā***  \_\_\_\_\_  Advancement  of  Supramundane  virtue, concentration and wisdom and instilment of those virtue, concentration and wisdom, into the continuity of corporeality and mentality of oneself is designated as ***lokuttarā*** ***bhāvan***ā.  For  those  two  kinds  of  ***bhāvanā***,  in  these  words  relating  to ***ñāṇadassanāvisuddhi***,  that  is  showing  how  the  Noble  Path  knows  and  sees penetratively  ***magga  sacca***  through  ***bhāvanā***  ***bhisamaya***,  the  second  one, ***lokuttarābhāvanā***  only  is  worth  desiring  but  not  ***lokiyabhāvan***ā.  It  is  because ***lokiyabhāvanā*** is only fundamental basis of that ***lokuttarābhāvan***ā. 

It is right. \_\_\_\_\_ Both all kinds of Four Noble Path-Knowledge give rise to each three kinds of Supramundane factors of Path of both virtue and concentration or Supramundane factors of Path of virtue, concentration and wisdom. The way how they give rise to ... is that \_\_\_\_\_ those ones factor or Path of virtue etc ... are given rise by efficiency  of  relation  of  compatibility  (***sahajāta  paccaya***)  etc.  In  another  method, those are given rise by  efficiency of relation of compatibility  etc, and relation of contiguity (***anantarapaccaya***) etc. 

The Noble Path-Knowledge eradicates those defilements which are source of committing wrong speech, bodily misconduct, wrong livelihood without any remains. It  also  eradicates  delusion  which  is  capable  of  concealing  on  factors  of  Path  of concentration called right endeavouring, right mindfulness, right concentration. The Fruit  Knowledge  extinguishes  again  those  defilements  eradicated  by  that  Path- Knowledge by means of ***paṭipassambhana*** (subsidence) in order to attain complete ease.

The Noble One instils with Supramundane factors of Path of virtue, concentration and wisdom,  which  are  produced  by  Path-Knowledge  and  Fruit-Knowledge  through ***samucchidana*** (eradication without any remain), ***paṭipassambhana*** (subsidence), into the  continuity  of  corporeality  and  mentality  of  himself.  Only  ***lokuttarābhāvanā***, therefore, is designated as the function of that Noble Path-Knowledge. (***Vs-2- 338, 339***) 

The  Noble  Path  Knowledge  called  Right  View  (***sammādiṭṭhi***)  benefits associating seven factors of Path by means of efficiency of relation of compatibility etc. The Right View that is associating with the consciousness of Fruition (-moment) etc.  benefits  Right  Endeavoring  ....  R....  Right  Concentration  by  means  of  both efficiency  of  relation  of  contiguity  and  efficiency  of  relation  of  determinative dependence (***upanissaya paccaya***). The Noble Path-Knowledge, therefore, not only gives rise to virtue, concentration and wisdom which are bases of factor of Path, but also instils with those into the continuity of corporeality and mentality, resulting in designating as ***bhāvanā*** (advancement) consequently. It means that kind of ***bhāvanā*** (Supramundane advancement) is worth desiring in ***bhāvanābhisamaya*** (realization as advancement). 

***ñāṇadassana visuddhiniddesa* finished  PAGE-522 9.18 Advantage of advancement of wisdom (*paññābhāvan***ā**)** 

Due  to  ability  of  giving  rise  to  great  purified  beneficial  effects, ***pakatisāvakabodhi***  (enlightenment  of  usual  disciple),  ***mahasāvakabodhi*** (enlightenment  of  great  disciple)  ***aggasāvakabodhi***  (enlightenment   of  Supreme Disciple),  ***paccekabodhi***  (enlightenment  of  ***paccekabuddha***)  who  is  one enlightenment  by  himself,  i.e.,  one  who  has  attained  to  the  supreme  and  perfect insight,  but  dies  without  proclaiming  the  truth  to  the  world),  ***sammāsambodhi*** (enlightenment  of  the  Supreme  Buddha),  this  advancement  of  wisdom (***paññābhāvan***ā)  has  numerous  advantageous  benefits.  It  is  uneasy  to  be  explicit advantageous benefits of advancement of wisdom even for giving very long time, due to presence of abundant benefits. However, there are four kinds  of advantages of advancement of wisdom in brief , viz,  

1. ***ñāṇakilesa viddhamsana*** = eradicating of various defilements. 
1. ***ariyaphalarasānubhāvanā***  =  enjoying  the  flavour  of  bliss  of  Noble 

Fruit, 

3. ***nirodhasamāpattisamāpajjanasamaṭṭhatā***  =  ability  to  enter  the 

cessation absorption (***nirodha*** samapatti) 

4. ***āhuneyyabhāvādisiddhi***  =  finishing  of  the  nobility  of  worthy  of 

offerings or of sacrifice (***āhuneyya***) amongst  (9) kinds of nobility of ***sangha***. 

Among those four kinds, it will be presented on the section of enjoying the flavour of bliss of Noble Fruit in this paper . (***Vs - 2 - 340***) 

` `**9.18.A.  Speech on Fruition - Absorption (*Phala-samapattikath***ā**)** 

These questions are essential to be understood with relating to the Fruition - Absorption,  

1. What is the Fruition-Absorption? 
1. Who are able to enter into that Fruition-Absorption? 
1. Who are unable to enter into the Fruition-Absorption? 
1. Why do they enter into the Fruition-Absorption? 
1. How does the process of entering into the Fruition-Absorption occur? 
6. How stability is maintained into the Fruition-Absorption? 
6. How does the process of emerging from the Fruition-Absorption occur? 
6. Which ***dhamma*** will arise contiguously after the Noble Fruition? 
6. Which ***dhamma*** is contiguously followed by the Noble Fruition? 
1. Among those questions, the answer of that first one is that \_\_\_\_ such nature 

of fixing of thought on an object (***appan***ā)  of ***nibbāna***, ***nirodhasacca***, which is an absorption associating with the Noble Fruit, is present; that nature of fixing of thought on an object is designated as the Fruition - Absorption (***phalasamāpatti***) . (***Vs - 2 - 341***) 

***Appanā***  –––  According  to  the  phrase,  "***takko  vittakko  sankappo  appanā*** ***byappanā***  ***cetaso  abhiniropana  sammāsankappo***",  found  in  Pali  Text, ***Dhammasanga***ṇī  (***Abhi-1  8***)  the  term  ***appanā***  is  designated  of  ***vitakka***  (initial application) . "***Cittam aramma***ṇ***e appeti abhiniropetiti appanā***" = Due to capable of initial applying of associating consciousness on to the object, the initial application (***vitakka***) is called "***appanā***" (fixing of thought on an object). 

**PAGE-523** 

**Terminology of commentary \_\_\_\_\_ *Pali Qustation* (*Mūla***ṭī***-1-101)*** 

In the Pali Text of ***Dhammasanga***ṇī, the term ***vitakka*** (initial application) is designated  as  ***appanā***  (fixing  of  thought  on  an  object).  However  in  the  usage  of commentary, the "**concentration of first absorption**" of mundane and Supramundane sphere, which is reaching into stable situation on respective object of ***samatha*** or object of ***nibbāna***, resulting from special performance of ***vitakka*** in order to apply the mind on object, is designated as "***appanā***", due to occurrence of association with ***vitakka***  called  ***appanā***  within  one  mind  moment  ,  according  to  preaching methodology, ***sahacara***ṇ***a*** (=arise together with). Both mundane and Supramundane concentration of second absorption etc, which are same degree of concentration of the first  absorption,  are  also  designated  as  ***appanā***  due  to  occurrence  of  stability  on respective  object  of  ***samatha***  or  object  of  ***nibbāna***,  resulting  from  removing  of opposite hindrances by concentration of the first absorption, according to preaching methodology, ***sadisūpacāra*** (= same condition). It means that the usage of all kinds of absorptions  of  both  mundane  and  Supramundane  sphere,  as  ***appanā***,  is  the terminology of commentary. (***Mūla***ṭī***-1-101***) 

2. Who are able to enter into that Fruition - Absorption? 
2. Who are unable to enter into that Fruition - Absorption? 

If it is question in this way \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ all kinds of worldlings called worldling with actively acquired mundane absorption, worldling without mundane absorption, are unable to enter into Fruition - Absorption due to lack of attainment of those Noble Path and Fruit. All Noble Ones are able to enter into respective Fruition-Absorption due to presence of various kinds of actively acquired Path and Fruit. During entering into Fruition - Absorption, it is different from mundane absorptions in which those persons with upper absorptions can enter lower absorptions. Those upper Noble Ones, Once-returnee etc, never enter into lower kinds of Fruition-Absorption called Fruition absorption of Upstream-enterer, etc,. This is because \_\_\_\_ after reaching into upper kinds of Noble Ones, Once-returnee etc, the preceding lower Fruition-Absorption has been extinguished, resulting in the nature with non-reappearance again. Then lower kinds  of  Noble  Ones,  the  Upstream-enterer,  etc.  are  also  unable  to  enter  into  the Fruition - Absorption of Once-returnee, etc, due to lack of attainment of those upper ones. It can be said in sooth,  

1. the  Upstream-enterer  is  able  to  enter  into  the  Fruition-Absorption  of 

Upstream-enterer (***sotāpattiphalasamāpatti***) , while, 

2. the Once-returnee, the Fruition-Absorption of Once-returnee, 
2. the Non-returnee, the Fruition-Absorption of Non-returnee, 
2. the  Arahant,  the  Fruition-Absorption  of  Arahant  respectively. 

Respective  acquired  Noble  Fruition-Absorption  of  themselves  can  be  entered specifically. (***Vs-2-341, 342***) 

**PAGE-524** 

4. **Why do they enter into the Fruition - Absorption?** 

They enter into the Fruition - Absorption in order to stay with blissfulness in recent life (***ditthadhammasukhavihārattam***). It means that they enter into the Fruition 

- Absorption for the purpose of staying with quiescence through extinguishing the fire of defilements which are capable of burning, in recent life. As the king chakavatin enjoys the flavour of bliss of kingship, similarly Noble Ones enters into the Fruition - Absorption, whenever they wish by determining of desired duration, in order to enjoy total happiness of quiescent element, ***nibbāna***, which is free from defilement, passion etc, resulting in extremely purified and noble Supra - mundane bliss of Fruition - Absorption . (***Vs-2-342***). 
5. **Way of entering 6. Way of stability  7. Way of emerging** 

Entering into that Fruition -Absorption can be performed through two kinds of factors, viz,  

1. not taking into heart any objects other than ***nibbāna***, 
1. taking into heart (= realizing) ***nibbāna*** only ***Pali Quotation (M - 1 - 370, 371)***. Ā***vuso – Koṭṭhika***... there are two kinds of factors in order to enter the Fruition 
- Absorption which is called ***cetovimutti*** (emancipation of heart ) with the object of ***nibbāna***,  in  another  method  \_\_\_\_\_  which  is  called  ***cetovimutti***  which  is  entered through ***aniccanupassanā*** as in front. These two kinds are \_\_\_\_\_\_ both non- realizing and  not  taking  into  heart  phenomena  of  all  kinds  of  conditioned  things  due  to occurrence of abandonment after seeing faults, and realizing and taking into heart the Unconditioned element, ***nibbāna***, called ***animmitta***, due to occurrence of void of all phenomena  of  all  kinds  of  conditioned  things,  through  the  mental  concomitant, intention  (***manasikāra***)  which  is  associating  with  consciousness  of  the  Fruition  - Absorption. (***M-1-370, 371, Mahā*** ***Vedalla Sutta; Vs-2-342***). 

In this case, the reason why another factor, 'not taking into heart any objects other than ***nibbāna***', is explicit further even though only one factor, 'taking into heart (realizing) ***nibbāna*** only', is worth saying enough for desire essence, is as follows: \_\_  ***Pali  - Quotation (M-1 -89)*** 

Due  to  cessation  of  ***vitakka***  ***vicāra***,  it  will  be  reached  into  the  second absorption,  which  is  capable  of  purifying  consciousness  of  continuum  of  oneself internally,  which  is  capable  of  developing  supreme  noble  concentration  of  mind, which is lacking ***vitakka*** ***vicāra*** but pleasurable interest (***pīti***) and bliss (***sukha***), which is produced by the concentration of first absorption or associating concentration. ( ***M- 1 -89***). 

**PAGE-525** 

When the Buddha preached about mundane absorptions, as shown in above Pali Text, it had been preached further about factors of absorption that are worth rejecting, as " ... due to cessation of ***vitakka***, ***vicāra*** ", even though attainment of the second  absorption  is  worth  accomplishing  when  three  factors  of  absorption,  ***pīti***, ***sukha***, ***ekaggatā*** are fulfilled. 

As rejected factors of absorption are preached beforehand, due to occurrence of various absorption which are worth getting  only  when those factors of absorption which should be rejected, can be overcome, similarly \_\_\_\_\_  it should be said the fact, 'not taking into heart  any  objects other  than ***nibbāna***', even though the Fruition - Absorption can be accomplished by realizing ***nibbāna*** only. This is because\_\_\_\_\_ it can be accomplished through the occurrence of consciousness which falls back to take object of all kinds of conditioned things. Therefore it should be said on the factor, "not taking into heart any object other than ***nibbāna***", beforehand. For a Noble One with the mind which is void from selfish desire on conditioned things after disenchanting of all conditioned things through cascade of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, the Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away etc., the consciousness of Fruition - Absorption which has the object of ***nibbāna***, deliverance from those all kinds of conditioned things, arises consequently. It  means that is worth saying on both two factors  of occurrence of consciousness of Fruition - Absorption produced by that mode, as 'not taking into heart any objects other than ***nibbāna***' and 'taking into heart (= realizing) ***nibbāna*** only'. (***Mahāṭī-2-517***) 

**Way of entering** \_\_\_\_\_\_ Way of entering into the Fruition - Absorption is as follows: 

The Noble One who desire to enter into the Fruition - Absorption approaches to quiet place, after avoiding from various kinds of sensual objects, ***vipassanā*** practice must be performed by generalizing on conditioned things by means of (9) kinds of ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  from  the  Knowledge  of  Arising  and  Passing  Away  to  the Knowledge  of  Adaptation.  In  the  continuum  of  that  Noble  One  with  cascade  of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, the Knowledge of Arising Passing Away, the Knowledge of Dissolution, the Knowledge of Terror etc, which are arisen, due to discerning in that way, at the end of Knowledge of Trans-lineage which is worth designating as Purity (***vodāna***)  with  the   object  of  phenomena  of  conditioned  things,  the  consciousness arises  through  full  concentration  of  Fruition  -  Absorption  (***appanājhāna phlasamāpatti***) by taking the object of ***nibbāna***, ***nirodha sacca***. Due to occurrence of inclination of the mind towards Fruition - Absorption during entering into Fruition - Absorption by means of cascade of ***vipassanā***  practice (***anupubba*** ***vipassanā***), for a ***sekkha*** person (belonging to training, one who has not yet attained Arahantship), only the Fruition-Absorption occurs but not the Noble Path. (***Vs-2-342***) 

**Trans-lineage with the object of conditioned things** \_\_\_\_\_\_ 

The  reason  why  the  Knowledge  of  Trans-linage  has  not  get  the  object  of ***nibbāna***  during  entering  into  Fruition-Absorption,  which  is  comparable  to  the Knowledge of Trans-lineage previous adjacent to the Noble Path - Knowledge, which has  the  object  of  ***nibbāna***,  is  that  \_\_\_\_\_  the  Noble  Fruition  is  not  the  cause  of deliverance from suffering of rounds of rebirth, dissimilar the Noble Path which is the cause of deliverance of rounds of rebirth. It is right \_\_\_\_. The Noble Path ***dhammas*** only are the real cause of deliverance from suffering of rounds of rebirth. Evidence is as follows:\_\_\_\_ 

***Katame*** ***dhamma*** ***niyyānikā***, ***cattāro maggā*** ***apariyāpaññ***ā. (***Abhi-1-254, 298***). 

**PAAGE-526** 

- Which  ***dhammas***  are  real  causes  of  deliverance  from  rounds  of  rebirth? 

Those are four kinds of Noble Path-Knowledge which are not belonging to rounds of rebirth. (***Abhi-1-254, 298***). 

These words were preached by the Buddha. Actually, the Knowledge of Trans- lineage, which arise before the Path - Knowledge with the nature of deliverance from rounds of rebirth through emerging from two situations, ***nimmitta, pavatta***, which is the  factor  of  relation  of  contiguity  for  the  Noble  Path,  is  worth  emerging  from ***saṅkhāra*** ***nimitta*** (phenomena of conditioned things). Therefore the occurrence of the Knowledge of Trans-lineage, just before the Noble Path, with the object of ***nibbāna***, is an appropriate occurrence. In contrariwise saying \_\_\_\_\_ the Knowledge of Trans- lineage, which is worth designating as Purity (***vodāna***), which is previous adjacent  to the Fruit-Knowledge that is the consequence of the Path-Knowledge and is unable to eradicate  defilements  by  means  of  ***samucchedapahāna***,  and  it  lacks  the  nature emerging  (***vuṭṭhāna***),  is  not  worth  getting  the  object  of  ***nibbāna***  as  object  by  all means. This is because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ those kinds of Knowledge of Adaptation occurring in two kinds of cognitive processes of Path and Fruit, have different conditions, indeed. 

It will be explict \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ In the cognitive process of Noble Path, those kinds of  Knowledge  of  Adaptation  (***anuloma***)  arise  through  conformity  with  the  Noble Path- Knowledge after reaching to the apex of all kinds of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, due to penetrating extraordinarily into grosser and grosser masses of selfish desire, anger, delusion, which are unexperienced to the penetrated previously. However those kinds of Knowledge of Adaptation (***anuloma***) which are occurring in the cognitive process of Fruition-Absorption, arise as a preliminary work (***parikamma***), due to occurrence of finishing of eradication of defilements, resulting in lack of responsibility to further eradicating function with merely to be accomplished the bliss of Fruition - Absorption of Noble Ones. Therefore, it is unusual occurrence of emerging of those kinds of Knowledge of Adaptation previous adjacent to that Noble Fruition by any means. It means  that  "due  to  emerging  from  phenomena  of  conditioned  things (***saṅkhāranimitta***), the last Knowledge of Adaptation among those kinds proceeding of  the  Noble  Fruition,  can  take  the  object  of  ***nibbāna***  through  such  means,  the emerging  with  that  mean  is  unusual  situation  indeed".  Due  to  this  reason,  this explanation of the commentary , "due to occurrence of inclination of the mind towards Fruition-Absorption during entering into Fruition-Absorption by means of cascade of ***vipassanā*** practice, for a ***sekkha*** person, only the Fruition- Absorption occurs but not the Noble Path ", is complete well. Therefore, the commentary explained that "for a ***sekkha***  person,  only  the  Fruition  -  Absorption  occurs  but  not  the  Noble  Path". (***Mahāṭī-2-518, 519***). 

***Phalasamāpatti* (Fruition-Absorption)** \_\_\_\_\_ The continuous occurrence of consciousness  of  the  Noble   Fruit,  for  such  desired  determined  period  without interruption,  by  taking  the  object  of  ***nibbāna***,  ***nirodhasacca***  through  the  full absorption (***appanājhāna***), is called ***phalasamāpatti*** (Fruition-Absorption). (***Mahāṭī-2-519***). 

**PAGE-527** 

**Inclination of the mind towards Fruition-Absorption** \_\_\_\_\_.  

"If the process of entering into the Fruition - Absorption, by means of cascade of  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  which  are  discerning  on  conditioned  things  from  the Knowledge  of  Arising  and  Passing  Away  to  the  Knowledge  of  Adaptation  in sequence, is achieved, for a ***sekkha*** person, an upper Noble Path is worth arising through cascade of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge in that way ", to which is worth arising a kind  of  interrogative  reasoning  and  with  referring  to  that  reason  the  commentary explained as "***phalasamāpattinnatāya*** = due to occurrence of inclination of the mind towards the Fruition-Absorption, for a ***sekkha*** person the Noble Fruition occurs but not the Noble Path". 

With regarding to that word, it shows that ***vipassanācāra*** which can arise the Noble Path  is  a  specific  kind  while  ***vipassanācāra***  (=  occurrence  of  ***vipassanā***  practice) which leads to Fruition- - Absorption is only another one. (***Mah***āṭī-***2-518, 519***) 

Rebutment to opinion of another school of ***Abhayagīri*** group said that "If the Upstream-enterer  performs  ***vipassanā***  practice  for  the  purpose  with  Fruition-- Absorption of Upstream enterer, he becomes the Once-returnee, if the Once-returnee performs  ***vipassanā***  practice  for  the  purpose  with  Fruition-Absorption  of  Once- returnee, he becomes the Non-returnee". It is worth debuting a charge in this way, that "if the Upstream-enterer becomes the Once-returnee, the Once-returnee becomes the Non-returnee  through  performing  ***vipassanā***  practice  for  the  purpose  with  each Fruition-Absorption, the Non-returnee will become Arahant, the Arahant will become the ***pacceka*** Buddha, the ***pacceka*** Buddha will also become the Supreme Buddha with the Knowledge of Omniscience." Therefore, if ***vipassanā*** practice is performed for the purpose  with  Fruition-Absorption,  there  is  not  any  results  other  than  the  Noble Fruition-. 

The word said by those teachers staying ***Abhayagīri*** with mistaken opinion, should be rejected by means of reference of Pali Text of ***Paṭisambhida Magga,*** “***dasa gotrabhudhamma vipassanāvasena uppajjanti***”. (***Paṭisam-65***) 

- Ten kinds of ***gotrabhudhamma*** (Trans-lineage ***dhammas***) arise by means of 

***vipassanā*** practice. (***Paṭisam-65***) If should be rejected by means of preaching in Pali 

Text  of  ***Paṭisambhida  Magga***,  by  which  those  ***vipassanā***  practices  are  separately preached as ***vipassanā*** practice which gives rise to the Noble Path and ***vipassanā*** practice which gives rise to the Noble Fruition. If it is said in sooth \_\_\_ "for a ***sekkah*** person who wants to enter the Fruition-Absorption, only the Noble Fruition arises but not the Noble Path due to presence of inclination of the mind towards the Fruition- - Absorption" and then it should be recognized on this principle only certainly. (***Vs-2- 342***) 

Furthermore, if this Noble Disciple has got the Noble Path which is association with the first absorption, The Noble Fruition occurring in that Fruition-Absorption will also arise by associating with the first absorption only. If the Noble Path which is associating with any kind of absorptions, second absorption etc, The Noble Fruition occurring in the Fruition-Absorption will arise by associating with each specific kind of absorption, The second absorption etc, respectively. Thus firstly the process of entering into Fruition-Absorption occurs for the Noble Ones. (***Vs-2-342***) 

***Pali Quottion (Mahāṭī-2-519)*** 

**PAGE-528** 

These  words  of  commentary,  mentioned  above,  are  the  explanations  which show that the Supramundane consequence (***lokuttarā*** ***vipāka***) is also the same with the wholesomedeed  as  lofty  consequence  (***mahaggatā***  ***vipāka***).  By  showing  the  same occurrence  of  the  Noble  Path  and  Noble  Fruition-,  by  means  of  associating  with specific absorption, in this section of Fruition-Absorption, it should be recognized the fact that "The same occurrence of those ones, by means of associating with ***bojjhanga magganga***  (factors  of  Enlightenment  and  factors  of  Path)  has  also  been  shown similarly. (***Mah***āṭī ***-2-519***) 

**The consciousness never ceases** 

There  is  a  question  whether  or  not  This  Fruition-  Absorption  is  a  kind  of absorption with cessation of consciousness. The Buddha, himself, preached that it is not  Fruition-Absorption  with  cessation  of  consciousness.  The  Venerable  Ā*nanda* asked the Buddha as follows \_\_\_\_\_  

"*Bhante* ... for a *bhikkhu*, " he is not a person with perception of earth on the earth, not a person with perception of water on the water, not a person with perception of fire on the fire; not a person with perception of wind; on the wind not a person with perception of boundless space on the boundless space; not a person with perception of boundless consciousness on the boundless consciousness, not a person with perception of emptiness on the emptiness, not a person with perception of neither-perception-nor -non-perception;  on  the  neither-perception-nor-non-perception,  not  a  person  with perception of this world on this world, not a person with perception of other world on the  other  world;  although  it  occurs  in  that  way,  how  will  the  improvement  of concentration  with  the  nature  called  he  may  be  a  person  with  perception,  be occurred?" asked by the Venerable Ā*nanda*. (***Ang-3- 262, 263***) 

At that time the Buddha answered as follows\_\_\_\_\_ 

***Pali Quotation (Ang -3-263)*** 

"Ā*nanda*..... under this Noble Admonishment, the *bhikkhu* is the person with perception  as  "***nibbāna***,  which  is  extinguished  of  all  conditioned  things, which  is abandonment of all grounds (***upadhis***), which is finishing of craving which is void of passion;  which  is  cessation  of  person,  is  quiescent,  that  ***nibbāna***  is  superior". Ā*nanda*.... in this way for the *bhikkhu* .... “he is not a person with perception of earth on the earth, not a person with perception of water on the water, not a person with perception of fire on the fire; not a person with perception of wind; on the wind not a person with perception of boundless space on the boundless space; not a person with perception of boundless consciousness on the boundless consciousness, not a person with  perception  of  emptiness  on  the  emptiness,  not  a  person  with  perception  of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; on the neither-perception-nor-non-perception, not a person with perception of this world on this world, not a person with perception of other world on the other world; 

**PAGE-529** 

` `although it occurs in that way, the improvement of concentration with the nature called 'he may be a person with perception will be occurred," preached by the Buddha. (***Ang -3-263***) 

It  will  be  presented  further  explanation  for  those  ones  who  can  not  clear understand. A such Noble One enters into the first absorption with the object of earth- ***kasi***ṇ***a*** by spreading circular object of earth-***kasi***ṇ***a*** up to infinite solar systems. Those mental ***dhammas*** of the first absorption are mental ***dhammas*** with the perception of earth-***kasi***ṇ***a*** or perception of earth on the earth, indeed. That Noble One enters into the Fruition- Absorption through ***vipassanā*** practice that is discerning on three general characters  of  mental  ***dhammas***  with  the  object  of  that  earth-***kasi***ṇ***a***.  Those consciousness of Noble Fruition- takes the object of ***nibbāna*** only but not the earth- ***kasi***ṇ***a,*** resulting in lacking perception of earth on the earth. The stable concentration which  is  associating  with  the  perception  of  ***nibbāna***  only  occurs  continuously.  It should be recognized similarly on the process of entering into the Fruition-Absorption through ***vipassanā*** practice that is discerning on mental ***dhammas*** of the second, third, and fourth absorption respectively. Then after taking into heart the space one sidedly through that earth-***kasi***ṇ***a*** object, the absorption of boundless space is being entered by spreading that space out until infinite solar systems, resulting in the occurrence of a person with perception of boundless space on the boundless space. Furthermore, he enters into the Fruition-Absorption through ***vipassanā*** practice that is discerning on mental ***dhammas*** of the absorption of boundless space. Those mental ***dhammas*** of Fruition-Absorption, take the object of ***nibbāna*** only, but not the concept of boundless space, resulting in the occurrence of a person who is lacking perception of boundless space on the boundless space. 

It should be recognized similarly on the process of entering into the Fruition- Absorption through ***vipassanā*** practice that is discerning mental ***dhammas*** as of the absorptions of boundless consciousness (***viññānañcāyatanajhāna***), empiness 

` `**PAGE-530** 

` `(***akiñcaññāyatanajhāna***),  neither  perception  nor  non  perception  (***nevasaññā***  ***nā***  ***saññayatanA jhāna***) respectively. Those mental ***dhammas*** of Fruition- Absorption, take the object of ***nibbāna*** only, but not any of these objects, boundless consciousness, concept of emptiness, mentality of neither perception nor non perception (very subtle perception), resulting in the occurrence of a person who is lacking perception of any kind  of  these,  boundless  consciousness,  emptiness,  neither  perception  nor  non perception. However, he will be a person with perception. It should be understood similarly  on  remaining  ***kasi***ṇ***a***  objects  water-***kasi***ṇ***a,***  fire-***kasi***ṇ***a***  wind-***kasi***ṇ***a***  etc. These  are  brief  account  of  meaning  of  above  Pali  Text.  Furthermore,  it  will  be presented on exegesis found in commentary, of meaning of above Pali Text. 

***Pali Quotation (Ang-3-288)*** 

This Fruition- Absorption is a kind of absorption with perception. It consists of consciousness and called ***sacittakasamāpattai*** (absorption with consciousness).In the continuum of Noble One who is entering into the Fruition-Absorption, after reaching into ***appanāphala*** (fixing of mind on object of ***nibbāna***), by taking into heart as "***etam santam, etam santam*** = this ***nibbāna*** is quiescent, this ***nibbāna*** is quiescent," the continuity  of  consciousness  of  Fruition-Absorption  occurs  as  "***santa,  santa***  = quiescence, quiescence thorough out the day. In the continuum of Noble One who is entering into the Fruition- Absorption, after reaching into ***appanāphala***, by taking into heart as "***pa***ṇ***ita, pa***ṇ***ita***, = superior, superior, " the continuity of consciousness of Fruition-Absorption occurs as " ***pa***ṇ***ita, pa***ṇ***ita*** " throughout the day. In the continuum of  Noble  One  who  is  entering  into  the  Fruition-Absorption,  after  reaching  into ***appanāphala***  by  taking  into  heart  as  "***nibbāna***  ***nibbāna***,  the  continuity  of consciousness of Fruition-Absorption occurs as "***nibbāna***, ***nibbāna***," throughout the day. All these words were preached by the Buddha with referring to the concentration of the Fruition-Absorption. This Fruition- Absorption is called ***sacitakasamāpatti*** = an attainment with consciousness really. (***Ang -A-3-288***) 

According to these Pali Text and commentary, the Fruition-Absorption is not attainment  with  cessation  of  consciousness.  The  attainment  with  cessation  of consciousness is only the Cessation-Absorption (***nirodha samāpatti***).It should be read the following exegesis of commentary. 

***Pali Quotation (Vs- 2-347) (Mah***āṭī ***-2-526)*** 

**PAGE-531** 

Noble Ones called Non-returnees and Arahant who have got Eight kinds of Attainment  (***aṭṭhasamāpatti***)  are  able  to  enter  the  Cessation  Absorption  (***nirodha samāpatti***).The reason why they enter into the Cessation-Absorption is that\_\_\_\_\_ due to disgusting of seeing the process of arising and passing away of conditioned things every  time,  resulting  in  taking  into  heart  a  way  that  they  will  stay  peacefully  as reaching into ***anupādisesa*** ***nibbāna*** (= complete extinction of ***khandha*** life ) which is the  cessation  of  mind  and  mental  concomitants  including  perception  feeling,  they enter into the Cessation Absorption called ***nirodhasamāpatti***.(***Vs-2-347***) 

`  `***aṭṭha samāpattilābhino pana anāgāmino, kh***īṇā***savā*** ***ca samāpajjanti.(Vs-2-344)*** 

This Cessation-Absorption is a kind of attainment (***samāpatti***) which can be achieved to enter for only Non-returnee and Arahant who have got eight kinds of mundane  absorptions.  Unless  a  ***meditator***  has  achieved  eight  kinds  mundane absorptions or unless he becomes any kind of Noble Ones, Non-returnee or Arahant, it should  be  reasoned  whether  or  not  a  kind  of  absorption  with  cessation  of consciousness  will  be  occurred  in  the  continuum  of  himself.  It  is  because  in  the commentary called ***Visuddhi Magga-2-344***, it is explained that the following persons, to wit, 

1. all worldling persons (***pathujjana***) 
1. all kinds of Upstream-enterer (***sotāpanna***) 
1. all kinds of Once-returnee (***sakadāgām***ī)  
1. Non-returnee  without  any  absorption  of  mundane  sphere  (***suddhavipasska anāgām***ī) 
5. Arahant without any absorption of mundane sphere (***suddhavipassaka arahanta***), are unable to enter Cessation Absorption (***nirodha samāpatti***) really Now it will be continued to present about the Fruition-Absorption. 

**Three factors for long range maintenance in the Fruition-Absorption *PaliQuitation (M-1-371)*** 

Ā*vuso Ko*ṭṭ*hika*...... there are three kinds of factors for long range maintenance in the Fruition-Absorption which can be said emancipation of heart (***cetovimutti***) with the object of ***nibbāna*** which lacks phenomena of conditioned things in other words, which  can  be  said  emancipation  of  heart  through  contemplation  of  impermanence (***anicca nupassan***ā) as in front, i.e., 

**PAGE-532** 

1. not taking into heart phenomena of all conditioned things, 
1. taking into heart ( = realizing ) the Unconditioned Element, ***nibbāna***, which is called ***animitta***, due to void of phenomena of conditioned things, 
3. strong determination by means of exact duration of absorption , as "it will be emerged from Fruition-Absorption when either, the moon or the sun reaches to this range," before entering into Fruition- Absorption. 

By means of these three factors, the long range maintenance in the continuity of consciousness of Fruition- Absorption occurs continuously. (***M-1-371***) 

***pubbe ca abhisaṅkhāra*** \_\_\_\_\_ Among those three factors, the third one, “***pubbe ca*** ***abhisaṅkhāra***”, means strong determination before entering into Fruition-Absorption, as "it will be emerged from the Fruition-Absorption when the moon or the sun reaches to this ranges." It is right. \_\_\_\_\_ Due to presence of strong determination that "it will be emerged from Fruition-Absorption at this "range", for such predetermined range of duration  is  not  enough  yet,  The  maintenance  of  continuity  of  consciousness  of Fruition-Absorption, occurs continuously throughout that range of duration. If should be recognized that long range maintenance in The Fruition-Absorption occurs in this way. (***Vs - 2- 343***) 

**Two factors for emerging from The Fruition-Absorption** 

***Pali Qustation (M-1-371)*** 

Ā*vuso ... Kotthika* ... There are two kinds of factors for emerging from The Fruition-Absorption, to wit, 

1. both taking into heart phenomena of all kinds of conditioned things, and 
1. not taking into heart (non-realizing) the Unconditioned Element, which 

is called ***animitta***, due to void of phenomena of conditioned things. 

Due  to  preaching  on  these  two  factors,  the  process  of  emerging  from  that Fruition-Absorption occurs through these two factors. (***M-1-371***) 

In that Pali Text, the word, ***sabbanimittānam*** (= phenomena of all conditioned things)  means  phenomena  of  all  corporealities,  feelings,  perceptions,  ***kamma***- formations, consciousness. The ***meditator*** can not take into heart phenomena of those all  kinds  of  conditioned  Things  simultaneously.  However,  this  word, ‘***sabbanimittānam***’  was  preached  by  means  of  thorough  discerning  on  all  kinds (***sabbasangahika***)  without  any  remains.  Due  to  inability  to  take  the  object  of phenomena of all kinds of conditioned things simultaneously, among three kinds of objects of life-continuum, i.e. ***Kamma - Kammanimitta - gatinimitta***, for the Noble One who takes into heart any one of those objects by mental concomitant called the intention  (***manasikāra***)  associating  with  the  consciousness  of  life-continuum,  the process of emerging from the Fruition-Absorption occurs consequently. (***Vs - 2- 343***) 

**PAGE-533** 

8. Which ***dhamma*** will arise contiguously after the Noble Fruition? 
8. Which ***dhamma*** is contiguously followed by the Noble Fruition? 
1. After preceding consciousness of Fruition-Absorption succeeding consciousness of Fruition-Absorption only arises contiguously. 
1. After  the  last  consciousness  of  Fruition-Absorption  the  life-continuum  arises contiguously. 

Then there are various kinds of arising of the Noble Fruit, to wit, 

1. The Noble Fruit which arises contiguously after the Noble Path, 
1. The Noble Fruit which arises contiguously after the Noble Fruit, 
1. The Noble Fruit which arises contiguously after Trans - lineage (***gotrabhu***) that is also called ***anuloma***,  
1. The  Noble  Fruit  which  arises  contiguously  after  wholesome  deed,  indifferent function  (***kiriya***)  of  absorption  of  neither-perception-nor-non-perception, respectively. 
1. Among those, in the cognitive process of Noble Path, the first Noble Fruit arises contiguously after the Noble Path. 
1. The Noble Fruit that arises contiguously after preceding Noble Fruit that occurs either  in  the  cognitive  process  of  Noble  Path  or  in  the  cognitive  process  of Fruition-Absorption, is called the second kind, i.e., the Noble Fruit which arises contiguously after the Noble Fruit. 
1. In  cognitive  processes  of  Fruition-Absorption,  the  first  Noble  Fruit  arises contiguously after Trans-lineage that is also called ***anuloma***. 

It  should  be  recognized  ***anuloma***  as  Trans-lineage  (***gotrabhu***)  in  these cognitive processes of Fruition-Absorption. If is preached in the Pali Text of ***Paṭṭhāna*** as follows\_\_\_\_\_ 

***arahato  anuloman  phalasamāpattiyā***  ***anantarapaccayena  paccayo.  sekkhānam anulomam phalasamāpattiyā*** ***anantarapaccayena paccayo. (Paṭṭhana-1-138)*** 

- The Adaptation (***anuloma***) of Arahant benefits the Fruition-Absorption of 

Arahant by efficiency of relation of contiguity (***anantarapaccaya***). The Adaptation of ***seekha*** person benefits the Fruition-Absorption by efficiency of relation of contiguity. (***Patthana-1-138***) 

If a Non-returnee with eight kinds of mundane absorption wants to enter the Cessation-Absorption  (***nirodhasamāppti***),  he  has  to  practice  both  ***samatha***  and ***vipassanā*** from the first absorption until the absorption of boundless consciousness by yoking  method  (***yuganaddha  naya***).  Then  the  absorption  of  emptiness  is  entered emerging  from  it,  four  kinds  of  predeterminable  functions  (***pubba  kicca***)  must  be carried out. Afterwards, the absorption of neither-perception-nor-non-perception must be entered. After arising of two or three times of absorption of neither-perception-nor- non-perception,  the  consciousness  becomes  absent  (=  reaching  into  Cessation-

Absorption). **PAGE-539** 

` `When the process of emerging occurs in due, an impulsion of Fruition-Absorption of Non-returnee arises. It is the impulsion of Fruition-Absorption of Non-returnee that arises just after wholesome impulsion of absorption of neither-perception-nor-non- perception. If an Arahant also wants to enter the Cessation Absorption, he has to practice  similarly.  Significance  is  that  \_\_\_\_\_  only  those  impulsions  of  indifferent function (***kiriyajavana***) can be occurred in the continuum of Arahant. Therefore, it should  be  recognized  the  fact  that  the  impulsion  of  Fruition-Absorption  arises contiguously  after  impulsion  of  indifferent  function  of  absorption  of  neither- perception-nor-non-perception. 

**Separation of duration**  \_\_\_\_\_ If the Non-returnee or Arahant enters into the Cessation-Absorption throughout seven days, there will be separation of duration for seven days between the impulsion of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, which has  arisen  before  reaching  into  Cessation-Absorption  of  Non-returnee  or  Arahant, which  is  the  first  one  after  emerging  from  the  Cessation-Absorption.  During  the Cessation-Absorption,  consciousness,  mental  concomitants  and  corporealities produced  by  mind  (CPM)  are  totally  ceased.  Corporealities  produced  by  ***kamma*** (CPK), Corporealities produced by temperature (CPT) and corporealities produced by nutriment (CPN) only occur continuously. 

Although impulsion of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and impulsion of the  Noble  Fruit  are  separated  by  seven  days  in  that  way,  it  can  not  be  said  no separation between them, due to presence of separation with corporeal ***damma*** which has different nature from mental ***dhamma***, resulting in designating as impulsion of Fruition-Absorption which arises contiguously after impulsion of neither-perception- nor-non-perception for those pre-and post-Cessation-Absorption mental ***dhammas***. 

Among various kinds of impulsions of Fruition-Absorption, remaining Noble Fruits, except those occurring in the cognitive process of Noble Path, are designated as The Noble Fruit that arises by means of the Fruition-Absorption. The Noble Fruit, which  occurs  in  the  cognitive  processes  of  either  Path  (-moment  )  or  Frutition- Absorption, which has been extinguished by the fire of defilements totally, which has the object of deathless element called ***nibbāna***, which is very comely due to lack of any ugly impurity of defilements, which has ***forsworn lokāmisa*** called selfish-desire, which is real peaceful, calmed, tranquil and quiescent, which is consequence of the Noble Path, is soaking wet with the supreme subtle bliss called ***anuttara sukha***, which is full of essence of Truth as the honey mixed with ambrosia, which is extremely purified and pleasant; which is much more pleasant than wholesome deeds of lofty ones  (***mahaggata***)  and  Supramundane  ones  (***lokuttarā***  ***kusala***,  due  to  presence  of more quiescent nature than the bliss of Noble Path, due to lack of drabness. 

If the wise ***meditator*** has strenuous effort to develop ***vipassanā*** practice, that kind of bliss of Fruition-Absorption, which is the property of Noble Ones only, due to presence of deserving flavour for Noble Ones only, which is the essence of flavour of Fruition- - Absorption, which is incomparable flavour for all beings, can be obtained. Therefore, the enjoyment of this incomparable flavour of the Noble Fruit is worth designating  as  the  advantage  of  ***vipassanā***  practice  in  this  admonishment  of  the Buddha really. (***Vs-2-343, 344***) 

**PAGE-535** 

**9.18.B Three kinds of *vipassanā*** **practices** 

***Pali Quotation. (Vs-2-347, 348)*** 

There are three kinds of ***vipassanā*** practices\_\_\_\_\_  

1. ***Vipassanā*** practice which is capable of keeping in mind conditioned things, 
1. ***Vipassanā*** practice which is capable of carrying out the Fruition-Absorption, 
1. ***Vipassanā*** practice which is capable of carrying out the Cessation-Absorption. 
1. Among  those  three  kinds,  ***vipassanā***  practice  which  is  capable  of 

keeping  mind  conditioned  things  (***saṅkhāra  pariga***ṇ***hanakavipassanā***),  is  the proximate cause of the Noble Path actually, whether it is strong or not. (***Vs - 2- 347***) 

If  ***vipassanā***  practice  is  retarded,  it  can  accomplish  the  Path  with  retarded enlightenment  (***dandhābiññā***  ***magga***).  If  ***vipassanā***  practice  is  sharp,  it  can accomplish  the  Path  with  quick  enlightenment  (***khippābhiññ  magga***).  This  is significance  f  occurrence  of  sharp  or  retarded  ***vipassanā***  practice.  If  should  be recognized the fact that every ***vipassanā*** practice which reaches to the stage with real nature of ***vipassanā***, is the fundamental cause of the Noble Path, indeed. (***Mahāṭī-2- 526***) 

2. ***Vipassanā***  practice,  which  is  capable  of  carrying  out  the  Fruition-

Absorption (***phalasamāpatti*** ***vipassanā***) should be sharp kind of ***vipassanā*** practice. Although  that  ***vipassanā***  practice  has  the  object  of  conditioned  things,  it  occurs through  both falling back to take the object of conditioned things and occurrence of causal  ***dhamma***  of  the  Noble  Fruit  which  takes  the  object  of  ***nibbāna***,  void  of conditioned things (***visaṅkhāra***) as the Noble Path. It is similar to advancement of the Noble Path (***maggabhavana***) (***Vs-2-348, Mahāṭī-2-526, 527***)  

3. ***Vipassanā***  practice  which  is  capable  of  carrying  out  the  Cessation-

Absorption (***nirodha samāpatti vipassanā***), indeed, should be neither retarded nor sharp but  moderate one as appropriate  one for the purpose  with entering into the Cessation-Absorption. (***Vs-2-348***) 

Very retarded ***vipassanā*** practice is unable to cease conditioned things, due to predominance in ***samatha***, resulting in ending as s***amatha*** only. Very sharp ***vipassanā*** practice, on the other hand, is predominant with knowledge due to ability to see faults of  conditioned  things  exceedingly,  resulting  in  ending  as  the  Fruition-Absorption. Therefore  the  commentary  explained  as  “***nirodhasamāpatti***  ***vipassanā***  should  be neither retarded nor sharp, but moderate one as appropriate one.” (***Mah***āṭī ***- 2- 527***) 

According to explanation of above commentary, the Noble One who wants to enter  the  Fruition-Absorption,  has  to  endeavour  for  attainment  of  very  sharp ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge. 

**PAGE-536** 

If ***vipassanā*** practice is performed for purpose with attainment of the Upper Path  and  Fruit,  to  eradicate  remaining  defilements,  but  not  intention  to  enter  The Fruition-Absorption, that ***vipassanā*** practice is the supporting factor as the relation of determinative dependence (***upanissaya paccaya***) for attainment of the Upper Path and Fruit, really. 

***Pali Quotation (Sam - 2 - 249, 250)*** 

*Bhikkhu*s ... without “penetrative knowing on all factors of the fivefold clinging to  existence  (***upādānakkhandh***ā)  through  the  full  understanding  on  object (***ñātapariññ***ā),  the  full  understanding  on  propagation  of  ***vipassanā***  practice (***tīra***ṇ***apariññ***ā), without practising in order to abandon strong selfish-desire on those all  factors  of  the  fivefold  clinging  to  existence  through  full  understanding  on abandonment (***pahānapariññ***ā), it is” not worth extinguishing sufferings...R...

With referring to above Pali Text preached by the Buddha, here the way of practice to distinguish all factors of fivefold clinging to existence through three kinds of full understanding, which is designated as ***nibbānagaminipatipadā*** (= the Way of Practice Leading to ***nibbāna***) has been accomplished completely with intention to facing with ***nibbāna*** which is finishing of all sufferings of rounds of rebirth.

(***M - 1- 90***) 

***Pali - Quotation (M - A - 1 - 305)*** 

Above preaching of the Buddha, with determinating maximum range of seven years and minimum range of seven days, was said by means of referring to ***neyya*** person with moderate sharp wisdom. For the person with sharp wisdom, the words as “f an admonishment is given at morning, the Supra - mundane Path and Fruition will be accomplished at evening, if an admonishment is given at evening, the Supra - mundane  Path  and  Fruition  will  be  accomplished  at  the  next  morning”(***M-2-300***), reached by the Buddha himself in ***Bodhirāja kumāra Sutta. (M-A-1-305)***. 

“*Bhikkhu*s ... This path (journey) is a single path, for purification of mind of beings, for overcoming worries and lamentation, for attainment of the Noble Path, for facing  with  ***nibbāna***.  That  path  (journey)  is  these  four  kinds  of  application  of mindfulness really,” manifested by myself (the Buddha). This manifesto is said with the intention of availability of any one of two beneficialness called these Fruition- Absorption of Non - returnee and Fruition-- Absorption of Arahant really by myself ( 

- the Buddha). (***M-1-90, 91***) 

**9.18.D Advantages of mindfulness of breathing** 

*Bhikkhu*s ... if the mindfulness of breathing is thoroughly developed, four kinds of  application  of  mindfulness  (***saṭipaṭṭhāna***)  will  be  fulfilled.  If  four  kinds  of application of mindfulness are thoroughly developed, seven factors of enlightenment will be fulfilled. If seven factor of enlightenment are thoroughly developed, The Path and the Fruit of Arahant will be fulfilled. (***M-3-124***) 

*R*ā*hula* ... such in breath and out-breath, which are final result of mindfulness of breathing, through developing and improving over and over again as the way of preaching by these (16) modes, are present. Those in-breath and out-breath are also ceased through those are worth obvious knowing. Without obvious knowing on it, they never cease. (***M-2-89***) 

For those in-breath and out-breath which are final result (***carimaka***), there are three kinds of final results by means of cessation of in-breath and out-breath,  viz, 

1. ***bhavacarimaka*** = in-breath and out-breath which are final result by means of life, 
1. ***jhāna carimaka*** = in-breath and out-breath which are final result by means of absorption, 
1. ***cuticarimaka*** = in-breath and out-breath which are final result by means of death moment. 

Among  various  existences,  in-breath  and  out-breath  occur  in  existence  of sensual sphere only, but not in existences of fine-material and immaterial spheres. Therefore those kinds of in-breath and out-breath are designated as ***bhavacarimaka***. Among various absorptions, in-breath and out-breath occur in previous three kind of absorptions,  i.e.,  first,  second  and  third  absorption  only  but  not  in  the  fourth absorption.  Therefore  those  kinds  of  in-breath  and  out-breath  are  designated  as ***jhānacarimaka***. Such in-breath and out-breath occur together with previous 16th mind moment  backward  from  death-consciousness  (=  counting  as  death-consciousness excluded) or 16th mind moment backward from end of one life (=counting as death- consciousness  also  included).  Those  in-breath  and  out-breath  cease  together  with death-consciousness  resulting  in  designating  as  ***cuticarimaka***.  In  this  section  that showing advantages of practice of mindfulness of breathing these kinds of in-breath and out-breath so called ***cuticarimaka*** are worth desiring. 

Due to presence of capable of thorough distinguishing on the objects of in- breath and out-breath if the arising (***uppāda***) of in-breath and out-breath which will occur synchronously with the arising of previous 16th mind moment backward from death consciousness of 17th mind moment backward from death-consciousness or 17th mind moment backward from end of one life, is reasoned by insight, it will be obvious in the continuum of practising *bhikkhu* who endeavours the practice of mindfulness of breathing over and over again. If the static stage (ṭ***hiti***) is reasoned by insight, the static stage of those in-breath and out-breath is also obvious. If the perishing stage (***bhaṅga***) is reasoned by insight, the perishing stage of those in-breath and out-breath is also obvious. 

It is right. \_\_\_ The *bhikkhu* who attained the Fruition-Absorption of Arahant through any meditation subject other than this practice of mindfulness of breathing can  or  can  not  predetermine  life-expectancy  of  himself  exactly.  An  Arahant  who attained the Fruition-Absorption of Arahant through developing on mindfulness of breathing with (16) modes thoroughly, indeed, can predetermine life-expectancy of himself exactly. That *bhikkhu* understands that “now my life span will remain as far as this  duration,  it  will  not  exist  beyond  this  time”  and  closes  his  eyes  after  having shower, dressing lower robe, full dressing upper robe with neatness and tidiness as he wishes. These Noble ***Mahā*** ***Theras***, namely, Venerable ***Tissa Thero*** who lived in ***Koṭapabbata*** Monastery, Venerable ***Mahā*** ***Tissa Thero*** who lived in ***Mahakarañjiya*** Monastery, where a timber tree yielding a very hard, durable wood, ***Milletia pendula***, Venerable ***Pindapātika Tissa Thero*** who lived in ***Devaputta*** state, two brothers of ***Theras*** who lived in ***Cittāla Pabbata*** Monastery, were an example worth following as Noble ***Theras*** with the practice of mindfulness of breathing, indeed. 

One  true  story  \_\_\_\_\_  In  two  brothers  ***Theras***,  one  of  those  ***Theras***,  after finishing ***pātimokkha*** ceremony ( = twice monthly meeting of *bhikkhu*s for keeping watch the Monastic Codes commanded by the Buddha), on one of full moon days, during  returning  back  his  dwelling  place  surrounding  with  many  *bhikkhu*s  and standing at the front of corridor \_\_\_\_\_ due to seeing the grounds covered with silver- like sand and open sky at early part of night with marvellous sight of moon-light as the flow of milk which is being poured out from ten directions, by seeing on shining moon-light 

**PAGE-539** 

` `peacefully and then by having reason on life span of himself that “both recent time and place are very delightful, resulting, in conformity with my purified inner desire… how  long  does  it  take  to  bear  this  burden  of  body,  after  knowing  and  seeing  on extinguishing of life-span in recent and said to surrounding *bhikkhus* as follows. 

“Ā*vuso* … which kind of deportment have you seen in order to take complete extinction of ***khandha-***life among *bhikkhus*…?” 

Some *bhikkhu*s asked that ... “*bhante* ... we have seen ***Mahā*** ***Theras*** who took complete extinction of ***khandha***-life by sitting deportment only on sitting place”. 

Some *bhikkhu*s asked that ... “*bhante* ... we have seen ***Mahā*** ***Theras*** who took complete extinction of ***khandha***-life by sitting deportment in the sky.” At that time the Venerable ***Mahā*** ***Theras*** said as follows \_\_\_\_\_ 

“*Avuso* ... now I would like to show my way of taking complete extinction of ***khandha***-life by walking deportment only,” said by ***Mahā*** ***Thera***. 

Then  that  Noble  ***Mahā***  ***Thera***  drew  a  cross  line  on  a  place  of  corridor. Afterwards he said that ... 

“*Avuso* ... after walking from this extremity of corridor to that extremity of corridor and them return back, when I just arrive on this line I would like to take complete ***nibbāna***.” 

After  saying  in  that  way,  he  walked  other  extremity  of  corridor  and  then returned back again and when he just trod  on the line the complete extinction of ***khandha***-life was accomplished. 

Due  to  presence  of  great  benefits,  up  to  attaining  complete  extinction  of ***khandha***-life, through the practice of mindfulness of breathing which is thoroughly developed by means of (16) modes in that way, the wise who wants to become the Noble One as  Eight Kind called Arahant, should like to endeavour The practice of mindfulness of breathing with many advantages, over and over again, by means of carelessness  on  advancement  of  ***samatha  vipassanā***  for  all  the  time  actually  in accordance with presenting in this work, namely as ***Nibbānagaminipaṭtipadā***, which has  been  accomplished  depending  upon  various  references  of  Pali  Texts, commentaries and sub-commentaries.
