**7. Section of *Saṅkhāarupekkhāañāṇa* (Contd) 7.24.B Definite way of classification** 

In the aspect of definite way of classification, six kinds of status, from the Fruit of Upstream-enterer to the Path of the Arahant, are designated as ***kāyasakkh***ī. Those Noble-Ones called  ***kāyasakkhī***  are  also  the  Noble-Ones  who  attain  all  (8)  kinds  of  attainment  called 

***samāpatti,*** indeed. Both the person with pure ***vipassanā*** who lacks all kinds of absorption, and the  person  with  access  concentration  (it  refers  to  those  persons  who  practise  meditation subjects  that  can  give  rise  to  absorption  without  attaining  absorption  but  only  access concentration  from  which  ***vipassanā***  practice  is  transferred)  and  the  person  with  only  the absorption of fine-material sphere, can not be designated as ***kāyasakkh***ī. 

**PAGE-386** 

The  word,  ***passaddhibahula***  (=  predominance  in  tranquility),  is  said  tranquility  as priority, resulting in referring to the person with vehicle of ***samatha*** practice, who attains exceeding concentration than concentration of sensuous sphere. How the person with vehicle of  ***samatha***  practice(***samathayānika  puggala***)  only  can  occur  the  Noble-Ones  called ***kāyasakkh***ī, is explained previously. (***Mahāṭī-2- 466***) 

The person who reaches to the Noble Fruit of Arahant after attaining either any one kind or all four kinds of absorptions, among four kinds of absorptions of immaterial sphere, is designated as ***ubhatobhāga vimutta***.(***Vs-2-297***) 

There are five kinds of persons of ***ubhatobhāga vimutta*** by means of both four kinds of absorptions of immaterial sphere, i.e., the person who reaches to the Noble Fruit of Arahant after  attaining  the  absorption  of  boundless  space  (***ākāsānañcāyatana  samāpatti***)  etc.,  and cessation-absorption (***nirodha samāpatti***). 

Emancipation occurs by means of removing of both bodily constituents (***rūpakāya***) and partial of mentally constituents (***nāmakāya***) for moderate long time through the absorption of immaterial sphere. Emancipation occurs by means of removing mentally constituents forever without any remains (***samuccheda***) through the Noble Path. Due to presence of two times of emancipation  through  two  kinds  of  situations,  it  is,  therefore,  designated  as  ***ubhatobhāga vimutta.*** (***Mahāṭī-2-466***) 

Due to predominance in wisdom through taking into heart conditioned things as ***anatta***, the practising person attains predominant controlling faculty of wisdom (***paññindriya***). (For the person with great wisdom, especially very subtle and subtle, profound and profound nature of  ultimate  ***dhammas***  appear  apparently  in  the  insight.  The  exegete  Sayadaw,  therefore, explained  that  for  the  meditator  who  takes  into  heart  conditioned  things  as  ***anatta***,  both predominance in wisdom and attainment of controlling faculty of wisdom are available.) Due to  occurrence  of  predominance  in  controlling  faculty  of  wisdom,  at  the  Path(-moment)  of Upstream-enterer, that meditator is designated as ***dhammānusār***ī. At six kinds of status, from the Fruit (-moment) of Upstream-enterer to the Path(-moment) of Arahant, those persons are designated  as  ***diṭṭhippatta***,  while  at  the  Fruit  (-moment)  of  Arahant,  the  Noble  One  is designated as ***paññāvimutta. (Vs-2-298)*** 

**7.24.C Seven kinds of persons by definite way of classification (*nippariyāya*)** 

Brief  explanations  relating  to  these  seven  kinds  of  persons  by  definite  way  of classification are as follows. \_\_\_\_ 

1. For  such  practising  meditator,  the  Noble  Path-Knowledge  called  ***vuṭṭhāna***  (emerging), which  emerges  from  conditioned  things  through  the  nature  of  impermanence  (***anicca***), occurs consequently. Due to predominance in firm faith and due to occurrence of sharp controlling  faculty  of  faith,  at  the  Path(-moment)  of  Upstream-enterer,  that  person  is designated as ***saddhānusār***ī. At six kinds of status, from the Fruit of the Upstream-enterer to the Path (-moment) of Arahant, those persons are designated as ***saddhāvimutta***, while at the Fruit (-moment) of Arahant, that person is designated as ***paññāvimutta***. 
2. Similarly  for  such  practising  meditator,  the  Noble  Path-Knowledge  called  ***vuṭṭhāna*** (emerging)  which  emerges  from  conditioned  things  through  he  nature  of  suffering (***dukkha***),  occurs  consequently.  Due  to  predominance  in  tranquility  (***passaddhi***),  the controlling faculty of concentration (***samādhindriya***) is predominated in that meditator. **PAGE-387** 

Due to occurrence of both sharp, powerful firm faith which has the basis of suffering, and fixed condition of two kinds of *dhura* called ***vipassanāgamana, maggāgamana*** at the Path (-moment) of Upstream-enterer, that person is also designated as ***saddhānusār***ī. At the middle six status, those persons are designated as ***saddhāvimutta***, while at the end status, Fruit (-moment) of Arahant, that person is designated as ***paññāvimutta.***  

3. The next kind is that\_\_\_\_ for such practisng meditator, the Noble Path-Knowledge called ***vuṭṭhāna*** (emerging) which emerges from conditioned things through he nature of non-self (***anatta***), occurs consequently. Due to predominance in wisdom and due to occurrence of very sharp and powerful controlling faculty of wisdom, at the Path (-moment) of Upstream- enterer,  that  person  is  designated  as  ***dhammānusār***ī,  while  at  the  middle  six  status, designated  as  ***diṭṭhippatta***,  at  the  end,  the  Fruit  (-moment)  of  Arahant,  designated  as ***paññāvimutta.*** 
3. Those persons mentioned above are not persons with eight kinds of attainments called ***vimokkha  jhāna***.  Those  persons  with  eight  kinds  of  attainments,  indeed,  at  the  Path(- moment) of Upstream-enterer, is designated as either ***saddhānusārī*** or ***dhammānusār***ī. At the middle six kinds of status, those persons are designated as ***kāyasakkh***ī, while at the end, the Fruit(-moment) of Arahant, that person is designated as ***ubhatobhāga vimutta.*** (***Mahāṭī-2-468***) 

**7.24.D The Knowledge with three synonyms** 

***Pāli Quotation (Paṭisam-259, Vs-2-299)*** 

- These  three  kinds  of  Knowledge,  the  Knowledge  of  Desire  for  Deliverance,  the 

Knowledge of Reflection, the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations are synonyms but varied in terminology only. (***Paṭisam-259***) 

Due to abandoning heartfelt desire which is concupiscent on conditioned things that are worth designating as ***uppāda, pavatta,*** ṭ***hiti, nimitta,*** the occurrence of desire for deliverance from  conditioned  things,  previous  adjacent  to  the  Noble  Path,  is  designated  as ***muñcitukamyatā*** ***= muccitukamyatā*** ***.*** 

In order to perform expedience of abandonment of those conditioned things, repeated reflecting on three general characters of conditioned things, in the middle stage of reasoning, is designated as ***paṭisaṅkhā.*** 

After  abandoning  of  sympathies  on  conditioned  things  through  reaching  to  the occurrence of voidness of heartfelt desire on conditioned tings, at the end of performance of that abandonment, the neutralizing on conditioned things stands well and it is designated as ***saṅkhārupekkhā*** (neutrality towards formations). (It means that it is not enough complete for entering into ***nibbāna*** as long as such period, the occurrence of successive knowledge through neutralizing on the process of reasoning as three general characters for that period is to be referred and it is said that ***ajjhupekkhanam santiṭṭhanā*** = the neutralizing on conditioned things stands well). 

With  referring  to  the  Knowledge  of  Neutrality  Towards  Formations  which  stands harmoniously and is quiescent through neutralizing on those conditioned things \_\_\_\_ this kind of noble preaching, **PAGE-388** 

***''uppādo saṅkhārā, te saṅkhāre ajjhupekkhatīti saṅkhārupekkhā. (Paṭisam-59)*** 

- the phenomenon of arising is the emblem of conditioned things, those conditioned things are neutralized  and  therefore  it  is  designated  as  ***saṅkhārupekkhā,''  (Paṭisam-59)***  etc.,  are preached. (***Vs-2-299***) 
25. ***Vipassanā*** ***practice leading to emerging (vuṭṭhāna gāmini vipassanā)*** 

After  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  of  this  gentleman  or  lady  with  actively  acquired  the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations reached into the apex situation, the Noble Path called ***vuṭṭhāna*** is attained with the result that it is designated as ***vuṭṭhānagāmin***ī. This term which is worth designating as either ***sikhāpatta vipassanā ( = ***vipassanā*** which reaches into apex situation) or ***vuṭṭhānagāminī  ( = ***vipassanā*** practice leading to emerging), is the name of three kinds of Knowledge which should be recognized as the Knowledge of Neutrality Toward Formations, the Knowledge of Adaptation (***anulomañāṇa***), the Knowledge of Trans-lineage (***gotrabhuñāṇa***)  commonly.  It  is  right.\_\_\_\_  Due  to  occurrence  of  reaching  into  the  apex situation of various kinds of successive ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, that ***vipassanañāṇa*** practice called those three kinds of knowledge is designated as not only ***sikhāpatta vipassanā*** but also ***vuṭṭhānagāmin***ī, due to ability to reach into the Noble Path called ***vuṭṭhāna.*** 

***Vuṭṭhāna***\_\_\_\_ Aggregates of fivefold clinging to existence, which are objects of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge,  which  are  whether  belonging  to  continuum  of  oneself  or  not,  are  worth designating as external (***bahiddha***) due to occurrence of deserving to discern as stranger. Due to emerging from both depended basis of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge; which is worth taking into heart by ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge; which is that external phenomenon of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge; which is called aggregates of fivefold clinging to existence; and continuity  of defilements which  is  ceaseless  occurring  in  continuity  of  corporeality  and  mentality  of  oneself,  and continuity of ***upādinnakkhandhā*** ***= pavatta*** called continuity of consequent aggregates, the Noble Path is worth designating as ***vuṭṭhāna*** (emerging). Due to ability to reach that Noble Path  called  ***vuṭṭhāna***,  it  is  designated  as  ***vuṭṭhānagāminī***  (***vipassanā***  practice  leading  to emerging). It means it joins together with the Noble Path-Knowledge. (***Vs-2-299***)  

How does the Noble Path emerge from phenomenon of conditioned things (***saṅkhāra nimitta***) called aggregates of fivefold clinging to existence which are objects of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge? How it emerges from continuity of defilements which are ceaseless occurring in continuity of corporeality and mentality of oneself and continuity of ***upādinnakkhandhā*** = ***ajjhatta pavatta*** called continuity of consequent aggregates, is as follows. \_\_\_\_ 

* ***vuṭṭha  hanañca  nesam***  ***āramma***ṇā***kara***ṇ***am,***  ***āyatim  anuppatti  dhammatāpādanañca.*** (***Mahāṭī-2-469***) 

Those three kinds of Knowledge, the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards formations, the Knowledge of Adaptation, the Knowledge of Trans-lineage, which are called ***vuṭṭhānagāminī*** ***vipassanā*** ( = ***vipassanā*** practice leading to emerging) occurs successively within a cognitive process of Path. Just after that Knowledge of ***Vipassanā*** Practice Leading to Emerging(= just after  the  Knowledge  of  Trans-lineage),  the  Noble  Path-Knowledge  arises  contiguously. Therefore  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  connects  to  the  Path-knowledge.  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge discerns conditioned things called aggregates of fivefold clinging to existence by taking the object of phenomena of perishing away of those conditioned things. When ***vipassanā*** practice 

leading  to  emerging  occurs,  although  those  kinds  of  knowledge  up  to  the  Knowledge  of Adaptation take objects of phenomena of perishing away of conditioned things, the Noble Path ***dhamma*** takes the object of the Unconditioned Element, ***nibbāna***, which is void of phenomena of conditioned things, which is called ***animitta***.  

**PAGE-389**  

Due to taking into heart the object of ***nibbāna***, it omits to take objects of phenomena of perishing away of conditioned things. Omitting to take objects of phenomena of perishing away of conditioned things in that way is called emerging from those phenomena of perishing away of conditioned things. 

Due  to  eradication  of  each  defilements  by  respective  kind  of  Noble  Path ***dhamma*** forever  those  defilements  reach  into  cessation  without  reappearing  in  future.  Unless  the advancement  of  the  Path  (***maggabhāvan***ā)  occurs,  ***upādinnakkhandhā***  (=  consequent aggregates with the source of those defilement) which will occur in future are still present. Due to successive finishing of defilements without any remains through the advancement of the Path, continuity of consequent aggregates which have possibility to arise in the presence of gum of craving and defilements, is unable to occur consequently. Capable of reaching into non-reappearance of defilements and aggregates in future through the efficiency of the Noble Path  in  that  way  is  called  emerging  from  ***ajjhattapavatta***  (=  continuity  of  consequent aggregates). It will be presented cognitive process of Path (-moment) (***maggavīthi***) in order to understand on these principles as follows.\_\_\_\_ 

1. **Cognitive process of Path (-moment) of moderate wise person (*majjima paññapuggala*)**      **L - “Vib – Int – MDA – Pre – Acc – Adp – Tra – P – F – F” – L - L  …..** 
1. **Cognitive process of Path (-moment) of great wise person (*tikkha paññapuggala*)**      **L - “Vib – Int – Mda–  Acc – Adp – Tra – P – F – F – F” – L – L …..** 

L = life-continuum (***bhavanga***) 

Vib = life-continuum (Vibration) (***bhavangacalana***) 

Int = life-continuum (Interruption) (***bhavangupaccheda***) Mda = Mind-door-advertence (***manodvārāvajjana***) 

Pre = Preliminary work (***parikamma***) 

Acc = Access (***upacāra***) 

Adp = Adaptation (***anuloma***) 

Tra = Trans-lineage (***gotrabhu***) 

P = Noble Path (-moment) (***ariya magga***) 

F = Noble Fruit (-moment) (***ariya phala***) 

The sequence of mind moment occurring in cognitive process of Path (-moment) of retarded  wise  person  is  life-continuum,  life-continuum  (Vibration),  life-continuum (Interruption),  mind-door  advertence,  preliminary  work,  access,  adaptation,  trans-lineage, Noble  Path  (-moment)  and  then  two  times  of  Noble  Fruit  (-moment),  afterwards  the  life- continuum occurs as appropriate times. For the cognitive process of Path (-moment) of great wise person, it occurs without preliminary work but includes three times of Noble Fruit (- moment). For those cognitive processes of Upper Noble Path (-moment), the cognitive process of Path (-moment) of Once-returnee etc., those are the same as mentioned above, except the name of Trans-lineage if replaced by Purity (***vodāna***). 

Among those kinds of consciousness of cognitive process, preliminary work, access, adaptation  and  trans-lineage  are  great  wholesome  impulsions  with  knowledge  found  in sensuous sphere (***kāmāvacara mahākusala ñāṇa sampayutta javana***). Appropriate feeling, either agreeable feeling (***somanassa***) or neutrality (***upekkh***ā) can be associated accordingly. Among  those  impulsions,  those  kinds  of  consciousness  of  preliminary  work,  access  and adaptation take the object of phenomenon of perishing away of conditioned things, while those kinds of consciousness of trans-lineage, Path, and Fruit, take the object of Noble ***dhamma, nibbāna***. 

Both these kinds of consciousness, preliminary work, access, adaptation, trans-lineage (purity), which are adjacent to this Noble Path-Knowledge and mind-door cognitive process of ***vipassanā*** practice with the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations, which is quite close to cognitive process of Path (-moment) but separated by life-continuum, which is reaching into the apex situation, are called ***vuṭṭhānagāminī*** ***vipassanā*** (***Vipassanā*** Knowledge leading to Emerging). If the duration of the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations is divided into three periods, it is the last period adjacent to the Noble Path-Knowledge. 

**PAGE-390** 

26. **The object of *Vipassan***ā* **practice leading to emerging (*vuṭṭhānagāminī*** ***vipassanā*****) *Pāli Quotation*** (***Abi-A-1-269***) (***Mūl***ṭī***-1-115***) ***2 paragraph*** 

What are the object of ***vipassanā*** practice leading to emerging is that \_\_\_\_ it can be answered  it  has  the  object  of  general  characters  called  ***aniccatā***  (the  phenomenon  of impermanence), ***dukkhatā*** (the phenomenon of suffering), ***anattatā*** (the phenomenon of non- self). Those characters called the phenomenon of impermanence, the phenomenon of suffering, the phenomenon of non-self has the same occurrence as concept (p***aññatti***). It is similar to concept. (***Abhi-A-1-269***) 

Therefore,  if  ***vipassanā***  practice  leading  to  emerging  takes  object  of  character,  the phenomenon of impermanence etc., that character is similar to concept, resulting in inability to emerge from object of conditioned things for the Noble Path that so-called ***vuṭṭhāna*** when it occurs. Furthermore, if ***vipassanā*** practice leading to emerging takes object of conditioned things, those characters, phenomenon of impermanence etc., will not be known penetratively. Due to presence of two extremities the commentator performs to explain by using question and answer. (***Mūla***ṭī***-1-115***) 

***lakkha***ṇā***ramma***ṇ***ata*** \_\_\_\_ The term, ***anicca*** means impermanent five aggregates, while the term,  ***aniccatā***,  the  emblem  of  impermanence  of  five  aggregates.  It  should  be  recognized similarly on those terms, ***dukkha*** and ***dukkhatā,*** ***, anatta***  and ***anattat***ā. During discerning on mundane  five  kinds  of  clinging  aggregates  as  ***anicca,  dukkha,  anatta***  although  ultimate aggregates  which  are  conditioned  things  are  taken  as  object,  those  phenomena,  the phenomenon  of  impermanence  etc.,  only  appear  in  the  insight.  Depending  on  the  way  of appearance in the insight in this way, the commentator answers that it has the object of general characters called ***aniccatā, dukkhatā, anattatā.*** (***Mūla***ṭī***-1-115***) 

The general character has the same occurrence as concept (***paññatti***).It is similar to concept.  It  is  not  worth  designating  as  sensual  ***dhamma  (=  paritta)***,  lofty  ***dhamma  (= mahaggata)*** etc. Nevertheless such practising *bhikkhu* keeps in mind three general characters as ***anicca, dukkha, anatta***, five aggregates appear, as rotten corpse which is tied with the neck, in  the  continuum  of  that  *bhikkhu*.  The  knowledge  with  the  object  of  conditioned  things emerges from conditioned things. (***Abhi-A-1-269***) 

**PAGE-391** 

Although three general characters are similar to the concept, ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge leading  to  Emerging  takes  the  object  of  conditioned  things.  Due  to  taking  the  object  of conditioned things, when the Noble Path-knowledge called ***vuṭṭhāna*** arises, it gives up the object of conditioned things but takes the object of ***nibbāna***, resulting in deserving to designate as  emerging  from  conditioned  things.  The  commentary,  therefore,  explained  that ''***saṅkhāramma***ṇ***ameva  ñāṇam  saṅkhārato  vuṭṭhāti***   =  the  knowledge  with  the  object  of conditioned things emerges from conditioned things." In this case, the knowledge with the object of conditioned tings is ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, while the knowledge that emerges from conditioned things is the Noble Path-Knowledge indeed. Due to similarity between two kinds of  knowledge,  the  commentator  explained  as  a  single  knowledge,  ***ñāṇam***,  through metaphorical usage called unique method (***ekattanaya***). 

**Worldly simile** \_\_\_\_ When *bhikkhu* sees and pleases bowl that is being brought by bowl seller and carefully observes that bowl, with a reasoning as “it will be bought”, and then three holes are seen. That *bhikkhu,* actually, has not attachment on those holes but on the bowl only. Similarly the practising *bhikkhu* has non-attachment on conditioned things after keeping in mind on three general characters. It should be recognized the fact that the knowledge with the object called conditioned things emerges from conditioned things. In the next simile, during buying three nether garments of Myanmar males called “***paso***” with three holes, it should be recognized similarly. (***Abhi-A-1-269***) 

27. ***Abhinivesa* and kinds of emerging (*vuṭṭhāna*) (*Vs-2-300,301; Abhi-A-1-270,271*)** 
1. In  this  Noble  admonishment,  some  practising  persons  usually  take  into  heart 

constantly internal five aggregates called conditioned things occurring in the continuum of themselves  at  beginning  stage  of  endeavouring.  After  taking  into  heart  constantly,  those internal five aggregates are discerned as ***anicca (dukkha, anatta)*** alternatively. However only discerning  on  internal  conditioned  things  can  not  give  rise  to  the  Noble  Path.  External conditioned things have to be discerned as the object of ***vipassanā*** practice. (It is because of the  fact  that  “***mamam  kāra  vatthunopi  pariññeyattā***  =  those  living  and  non-living  things called  external  corporeality  and  mentality;  which  are  worth  taking  into  heart  as  “my properties”;  which  are  depended  factor  of  the  craving;  are  ***dhammas***,  which  are  worth distinguishing  called  ***pariññeyya***,  indeed.)  Therefore  both  five  aggregates  occurring  in continuum of external ones and  corporealities produced by temperature, occurring in non- living world, which are called ***anupādinna saṅkhāra***, are discerned as ***anicca, dukkha, anatta*** alternatively. (Due to presence of same situation in external continuum, those ***dhammas*** are discerned as a whole  generally.) That practising meditator performs ***vipassanā*** practice by alternative  discerning  as  three  general  characters  on  either  internal  conditioned  things sometimes  or  external  conditioned  things  sometimes.  During  discerning  on  internal conditioned things, for that meditator, ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge connects with the Noble Path- Knowledge. It can be said this meditator **“emerges from internal through taking into heart internal constantly.”** 

**PAGE-392** 

2. In the next kind\_\_\_\_ During discerning on external conditioned things, if ***Vipassanā*** 

Knowledge of that meditator connects with the Noble Path-Knowledge, it can be said this meditator “**emerges from external conditioned things, through taking into heart internal constantly**”. 

[Notes : \_\_\_\_ These words, “emerges from internal conditioned things, emerges from external  conditioned  things”,  are  said  by  indirect  way  of  preaching  methodology,  due  to presence of object of either internal or external conditioned things respectively. In the aspect of definite  way  of  preaching  methodology,  it  emerges  from  all  both  internal  and  external conditioned things really.] 

3. It  should  be  recognized  similarly  on  emerging  from  external  conditioned  things 

through taking into heart external constantly and  

4. emerging  from  internal  conditioned  things  through  taking  into  heart  external 

constantly 

5. Another practising meditator usually takes into heart constanly corporeal ***dhammas*** 

at the beginning stage of endeavouring. Afterwards, both four great primary corporealities and derived corporealities are discerned as ***anicca, dukkha, anatta*** as a whole. However, only discerning on corporal ***dhammas***, can not give rise to the Noble Path. Mental ***dhammas*** have also to be discerned as the object of ***vipassanā*** practice. Therefore, these ***dhammas***, feeling, perception, kamma-formations, consciousness, which are occurring by taking the object of that corporeal ***dhammas*** as object are kept in mind by knowledge in a way that “these feeling, perception, kamma-formations, consciousness are mental ***dhammas***”, and then those mental ***dhammas*** are discerned as three  general characters alternatively. That  practising meditator performs ***vipassanā*** practice by alternative discerning as three general characters on either corporeal  ***dhammas***  sometimes,  or  mental  ***dhammas***  sometimes.  During  discerning  on corporeal ***dhammas***, for that meditator, ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge connects with the Noble Path- Knowledge. It can be said this meditator “**emerges from corporeal dahmma through taking into heart corporeal *dhamma* constantly.**” 

6. In  the  next  kind\_\_\_\_  During  discerning  on  mental  ***dhammas***,  if  ***Vipassanā*** 

Knowledge of that meditator connects with the Noble Path-Knowledge, it can be said this mediator “**emerges from mental *dahmma* through taking into heart corporeal *dhamma* constantly.**”  

7. It  should  be  recognized  similarly  on  “**emerges  from  mental  *dahmma*  through** 

**taking into heart mental *dhamma* constantly.**” and 

8. “**emerges from corporeal *dahmma* through taking into heart mental *dhamma*** 

**constantly.**” 

[Notes:\_\_\_\_ As the way of taking into heart on corporeal ***dhammas*** at the beginning stage is applied for the person with vehicle of pure ***vipassanā*** practice, the way of taking into heart on mental ***dhammas*** at the beginning stage, on the other hand, is applied for the person with vehicle of ***samatha*** practice, in general. It should be recognized on the word, ***abhinivesa =*** "taking  into  heart  constantly",  means  distinguishing  by  knowledge  through  four  modes  of discerning  as  ***lakkha***ṇ***a***  (characters),  ***rasa***  (function),  ***paccupaṭṭhāna,***  (manifesation), ***padaṭṭhāna*** (proximate cause) etc., which are worth performing previous to ***vipassanā*** practice. Therefore,  ways  of  keeping  in  mind  and  distinguishing  on  corporeal ***dhammas***  previously through both four modes, ***viz, lakkha***ṇ***a, rasa, paccupaṭṭhāna, padaṭṭhāna*** and dependent- origination method, i.e., due to obvious occurrence of causal ***dhammas***, ignorance etc., how resultant corporeal ***dhammas*** arises apparently … etc., are called taking into heart corporeal ***dhammas*** constantly. 

**PAGE-393** 

It should be recognized similarly on the meaning of taking into heart mental ***dhammas*** constantly. It should be recognized the fact that in above words of commentary, discerning cause and condition (***paccaya pariggaha***) is explained together with discerning corporeality (***rūpapariggaha***)  and  discerning  mentally  (***nāmapariggaha***)  by  metaphorical  usage, ***lakkha***ṇā***hāranetti***, due to presence of the same characters, "discerning (***pariggaha***)".] 

9. **P**ā**li Quotation (*Vs-2-300*)(*Mahāṭī-2-470*)** 
* ***yam kiñci samudaya dhammam, sabbam  tam nirodhadhammam. (Dī-1-102)*** 

After taking into heart in a way that “every conditioned thing occurring in any kind of three realms has the nature of arising; that conditioned thing has also the nature of cessation indeed”,  etc.,  it  can  be  said  by  the  time  the  Noble  Path  arises,  it  can  emerges  from  five aggregates simultaneously. 

With  regarding  to  this  phrase,  ***yam  kiñci  samudaya  dhammam,  sabbam  tam nirodhadhammam*** = every conditioned thing occurring in any kind of three realms has the nature  of  arising;  that  conditioned  thing  has  also  the  nature  of  cessation  indeed,  the commentator Sayadaw, actually, showed ***vipassanā*** contemplation called the knowledge which is capable of keeping in mind the phenomena of arising and passing away of conditioned things. Even though a way of ***vipassanā*** contemplation called the Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away in that way, it means that after keeping in mind both corporealities by brief method  hat  “***ruppanaṭṭhena  rūpam***  =  due  to  ability  to  change  and  alter,  it  is  called corporeality”  etc.,  and  mentalities  by  brief  method  that  “***namanaṭṭhena  nāmam***  =  due  to ability to incline towards object, it is called mentality”…, afterwards causal ***dhammas*** of those corporeality  and  mentality  are  also  kept  in  mind  by  method  that  “***avijjā***  ***saṅkhārā***  ***ta***ṇ***hā*** ***upādanam  bhavo  hetu***  =  ignorance,  craving,  clinging,  formations,  kamma  comming-into- existence  (action)  are  causal  ***dhammas***”,  then  the  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  is  drive-through function on the objects of conditioned things called corporeality, mentality, causal ***dhammas***, resultant ***dhammas*** as ***sinno*** horse is driven on even ground, due to presence of exceeding Knowledge, the Noble Path of the practising meditator who knows and see penetratively and simultaneously  four  Noble  Truths  within  one  sitting  deportment  through  nine  kinds  of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge in sequence, ***udayabhayañāṇa, bhangañāṇa*** etc., emerges from five kinds of aggregates synchronously.** 

**PAGE 394** 

It  should  be  meant  in  variety  out  of  these  facts  mentioned  above.  If  it  is  meant, undesirable  meaning,  such  as  …”  a  single  great  wholesome  impulsion  keep  in  mind, distinguish  and  know  five  aggregates  through  both  characteristic,  function,  manifestation, proximate  causes  and  causal  relationship,  simultaneously”,  can  occurred.  It  should  not  be misunderstood in that way. It is because those ***dhammas***, colour, sound, smell, taste etc, are unable to be taken into heart synchronously by one mind moment or one cognitive process. If an appropriate meaning would be said, as such meditator has experienced with such corporeal ***dlhammas*** and mental ***dhammas*** are not essential to be touched again but enough to touch by ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge because that knowledge is very sharp and powerful as thunderbolt. Within very short moment, billion billions impulsions of mind-door cognitive processes of great wholesome ***Vipassanā*** merits with Knowledge, accomplish to keep in mind corporeality and mentality, causal ***dhammas*** and to discern three general characters, one by one. It means that  the  commentary  explained  on  the  emerging  from  five  aggregates  called  “***yam  kiñci samudaya dhammam, sabbam tam nirodhadhammam***”, by means of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge of very sharp wisedom person (***tikkha paññav***ā), but not the person with retarded ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge with numerous times of life-continuum and interrupting by varieties of objects that leads to failure. (see ***Mahāṭī-2-470***) 

***Pāli Quotation (Mahāṭī-2-470)*** 

It should be recognized on the phrase, “simultaneous emerging from every conditioned thing occurring in three realms”, by means of ability of ***vipassanā*** practice leading to emerging without  differentiating  between  internal,  external  etc.,  but  as  a  whole  generally  in  a  way that…“***yam kiñci samudaya dhammam sabbam, tam niroghadhammam*** = every conditioned thing occurring in any kind of three realms has the nature of arising; that conditioned thing has also the nature of cessation, indeed, as shown in the stage of Knowledge of Comprechension mentioned previously. “That way of emerging can be occurred by very sharp wisdom person who  can  perform  ***vipassanā***  practice  by  following  the  preaching  of  the  Buddha…”  etc., explained by olden learned teachers really.(***Mahāṭī-2-470***) 

In  accordance  with  above  explanations,  the  way  of  discernment  called  “***yam  kiñci samudaya dhammam, sabbam tam nirodhadhammam***”, is concerned to the Noble Disciples called ***sammukha sāvaka***, who enlighten in front of the Buddha during listening ***dhammas***, who are designated as ***ugghaṭitaññū*** (= very sharp wise who enlightens just after listening an half  or  a  verse  of  ***dhammas***),  and  ***vipañcitaññū***  (=  moderate  wise  who  enlightens  after listening ***dhammas*** in detail but not in brief).  

**PAGE-395** 

It should be recognized in this way. 

It should be reasoned for every meditator in a way whether he, himself, is the same kind as those persons called ***ugghaṭitaññū, vippañcitaññū*** or not. If one person understands himself that he does not concern to those kinds of persons called ***ugghaṭitaññū, vippañcitaññū*** really, he has to reason whether advancement of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge is available or not without  knowing  and  seeing  the  ultimate  nature  of  corporeal  and  mental  ***dhammas***  and principle of dependent origination thoroughly, in the next method\_\_\_\_ whether advancement of  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  is  available  or  not  by  discerning  as  “***yam  kiñci  samudaya dhammam, sabbam tam nirodhadhammam*** = every conditioned thing occurring in any kind of three realms has the nature of arising; that conditioned thing has also the nature of cessation, 

indeed”. 

Furthermore, this way of discernment  is the briefest way in the field of ***vipassanā*** practice.  Due  to  occurrence  of  minimum  range  of  objects  of  ***vipassanā***  practice  for  those persons, ***ugghaṭitaññū*** and ***vippañcitaññū*** only, it should be reasoned whether the Noble Path- Knowledge can be attained by that way of discernment or not for the person who is still in the status of ***neyya*** (= the person who can enlighten after listening and learning ***dhammas*** in detail and practising for appropriate time; he can not enlighten during listening without practising for appropriate time.] (It should be recognized the fact that these words are said in accordance with ***vadantivāda*** found in ***Mahāṭī-2-470***) 

This is because the fact that \_\_\_\_ during performing ***vipassanā*** practice through any way, in brief or in detail method, discerned objects called ultimate elements are groups of ***dhammas***  of  Noble  Truth  of  Suffering  and  Noble  Truth  of  cause  of  Suffering,  wich  are commonly known as all conditioned things occurring in three realms. Even if the method of discernment is whatever kind, brief account or detail account, qualitative numbers of ultimate ***dhammas*** which have to be known and seen penetratively are the same. It is only difference in way of discernment but qualitative numbers of ***dahmmas*** which are essential to be known and mode of knowing and seeing are the same between those methods. In the aspect of quality of Knowledge  of  Disciples,  there  is  only  one  kind  of  ***vipassanā***  ***bhūmi***  (=  the  minimum requirements of comprehension) is the same among all disciples indeed. 

**Noble *Mahā*** ***Thera* with favorite universal practices\_\_\_\_\_** 

***Pāli Quotation (Sam-A—98)*** 

**PAGE-396** 

About  a  Noble  Mahā  Thera  with  favorite  universal  practice  can  be  found  in  ***kim sukopama  sutta***  (***Sam-2-396,397***).  The  commentary  designated  him  as  ***tebhūmaka kammaṭṭhānika puggala*** (= the Noble Mahā Thera with favorite universal practice) (***Sam-A-3-***

***98***). That Arahant was favourable with all kinds of meditation subjects. Even if previous or future or present conditioned things, ***dhammas*** of sensuous sphere or fine-material sphere or immaterial sphere, would be object of ***vipassanā*** practice, every ***dhamma*** was available as object  of  ***vipassana***  practice  for  him  without  any  difficulty.  There  was  no  unfavourable meditation subject or unfavourable time for that Noble Mahā Thera, really. (***Sam-A-3-98***) 

10. One  practising  meditator  usually  discerns  on  conditioned  things  as  “***anicca***”  at  the beginning of ***vipassanā*** practice. Only the way of discerning on conditioned things as ‘***anicca***’ can not give rise to the Noble Path called ***vuṭṭhāna***. Both way of discerning as ***dukkha*** and ***anatta***  are  also  essential  for  accomplishment  of ***vipassanā***  practice.  Therefore  conditioned things  are  discerned  as  both  ***dukkha***  and  ***anatta***.  During  discerning  as  ***anicca***  for  that meditator, if the Noble Path-Knowledge called ***vuṭṭhāna*** arises, it can be said this ***meditator*** **emerges from conditioned things through *anicca* after taking into heart the nature of *anicca* (impermanence) constantly.** 
10. The next kind \_\_\_\_ For a  meditator, during discerning on conditioned things as ***dukkha***, if the Noble Path-Knowledge called ***vuṭṭhāna*** arise, it can be said this meditator **emerges from conditioned  things  through  *‘dukkha’*  after  taking  into  heart  the  nature  of  *anicca*  (= impermanence) constantly.** 
10. During discerning on conditioned things as ‘***anatta***’ if the Noble Path-knowledge called ***vuṭṭhāna***  arise,  it  can  be  said  this  meditator  **emerges  from  conditioned  things  through *‘anatta’* after taking into heart the nature of *anicca* (= impermanence) constantly.** 

13-18.  As  there  are  three  kinds  of  persons  who  emerge  from  conditioned  things  after discerning on conditioned things as ‘***anicca***’ constantly, similarly, there are also each three kinds of persons who emerge from conditioned things after discerning on conditioned things as both ***dukkha*** and ***anatta*** respectively. (***Vs-2-300,301***) 

28. **Various kinds of persons** 

There are three kinds of persons, viz, the person who takes into hart conditioned things as ‘***anicca***’constantly at the beginning stage, the person who takes into hart conditioned things as ‘***dukkha***’ constantly at the beginning stage, the person who takes into hart conditioned things as ‘***anatta***’ constantly at the beginning stage. While the Noble Path-Knowledge called ***vuṭṭhāna*** arises, on the other hand, if the Noble Path called ***vuṭṭhāna*** arises during discerning as  ***anicca***,  those  three  kinds  of  persons  usually  occur  predominance  in  faith (***saddhādhimokkha***), resulting in availability of controlling faculty of faith. They emancipate through  ***animitta  vitmikkkha***.  At  the  Path(-moment)  of  Upstream-enterer,  these  persons become ass ***saddhāanusārī*** person. 

**PAGE-397** 

In remaining seven status, from the Fruit(-moment) of Upstream-enterer to the Fruit (- moment) of Arahant, these persons are ***saddhāvimutta***. 

If the Noble Path-Knowledge called ***vuṭṭhāna*** arises during discerning on conditioned things as ‘***dukkha***’, those three kinds of persons usually occur predominance in tranquility (***passaddhi***), resulting in availability of controlling faculty of concentration. They emancipate through  ***appa***ṇ***ikhitavimokkha***.  At  all  eight  kinds  of  status,  from  the  Path(-moment)  of Upstream-enterer to the Fruit (-moment) of Arahant, these persons are ***kāyasakkhī*** persons. Especially \_\_\_\_  among these persons, for a such person, the absorption of immaterial sphere is  the  fundamental  basis  of  ***vipassanā***  practice;  that  person  with  fundamental  basis  of ***vipassanā***  practice  as  absorption  of  immaterial  sphere  can  be  designated  as ***ubhatobhāgavimutta*** at Fruit (-moment) of Arahant. 

In the next kind\_\_\_\_ for those three kinds of persons, if the Noble Path called ***vuṭṭhanā*** arises during discerning on conditioned things as ‘***anatta***’, those three kinds of persons usually occur predominance in wisdom, resulting in availability of controlling faculty of wisdom. They emancipate through ***suññata viomokkha***. At the Path (-moment) of Upstream-enterer, these persons become as ***dhammānusār***ī. For the middle six status, from the Fruit (-moment) of Upstream-enterer to the Path (-moment) of Arahant, those persons become as ***diṭṭhippatta***. At the Fruit (-moment) of Arahant, those persons occur as ***paññāvimutta*** persons. (***Vs-2-301***) 

29. **Twelve kinds of similes (*Vs-2-301,305*)** 

Here, twelve kinds of similes are worth knowing in order to be explicit this ***vipassanā*** Knowledge leading to Emerging together with preceding and succeeding kinds of ***vipassanhā*** knowledge from the Knowledge of Terror to the Knowledge of Trans-lineage. The followings are brief account of those similes.\_\_\_\_ 

* ***vaggulī*** ***ka***ṇ***hasappo ca, gharam go yakkhī*** ***dārako.*** 

`   `***khuddam pipāsam sītu***ṇ***kam, andhakāram visena ca.*** 

These similes are appropriate allusion from the beginning of the Knowledge of Terror, due to presence of availability of parallelism which stands on various stages of knowledge. The advantage is that \_\_\_\_ if these similes are alluded and shown in this concern of ***vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging, functions of all kinds of knowledge, from the Knowledge of Terror to the Fruit-Knowledge will be clearly understood. It is because it shows by standing at the middle condition. Therefore it should be said in ***visuddhikathā*** (section of purification) that these similes are worth alluding and showing only in this concern of ***vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging. (***Vs-2-301***) 

1. ***vagguli* = flying fox** 

A flying fox perches on a hardwood tree producing illipe nuts (***Bassia lingifolia***) with five branches with the intention that “either flower or fruit will be available on this tree”. Afterwards, a small branch is observed carefully and any kind of flower or fruit can not be seen to be eaten. Similarly, remaining branches, second, third, fourth and fifth ones are observed one by one and neither flower nor fruit can be seen anymore. After reasoning that “this tree is lack  of  fruit,  any  kind  of  edible  flower  and  fruit are  absent  on  this  tree”,  that  flying  fox abandons heartfelt desire on that tree and then climbs on upright branch; the head emerges from forked branches and looks above, afterwards it flies into the sky and perches on another tree with fruits. 

In  above  simile,  it  should  be  recognized  on  the  meditator  as  flying  fox;  while aggregates of fivefold clinging to existence as hardwood tree producing illipe nuts with five braches;  the  way  of  taking  into  heart  aggregates  of  fivefold  clinging  to  existence  at  the beginning stage as perching on that tree, performance of ***vipassanā*** practice by discerning on corporeal  aggregate  without  any  essence  of  permanence,  happiness,  self,  pleasantness, afterwards remaining four mental aggregates are discerned by three general characters as that flying fox’s manner in a way that observing on one branch and nothing to be eaten is seen and remaining branches are observed again; the occurrence of three kinds of ***vipassanā*** knowledge, the Knowledge of Desire for Deliverance, the Knowledge of Reflection the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations, which abandon conditioned things after disenchanting on five aggregates through seeing on character of impermanence etc., in the continuum of meditator as the abandonment of heartfelt desire on that tree after reasoning that “this tree lacks any kind of fruit” by that flying fox; the Knowledge of Adaptation, which leads to upright direction called ***nibbāna***, of meditator as climbing on upright branch; the Knowledge of Trans-lineage which is able to perceive the Noble ***dhammas*** called ***nibbāna***, as emerging of the head from forked branches and looking above; the Noble Path-Knowledge which enters into ***nibbāna*** as the manner of flying into sky, respectively. (***Vs-2-302***) 

It should be recognized on the Knowledge of Adaptation as the occurrence of upright direction of branch due to ability to remove wile, ruse (***māyā, sātheyya***) etc., which are capable of  making  deceitful  mind;  while  the  Knowledge  of  Trans-lineage  which  sees  ***nibbāna***  as looking above; he Noble Path-Knowledge which stands on ***nibbāna*** that lacks dependence as flying into sky, respectively. (***Mahāṭī-2-471***) 

2. ***ka***ṇ***hasappa* = sea snake** 

A fisherman brings a fish-trap made of bamboo with intention to catch fishes and sets that trap under water.  

**PAGE-399** 

When the son of fisherman gropes into trap by hand at an appropriate time, neck of a sea snake is  grasped.  However  fisherman’s  son  pleases  with  reasoning  that  “I’ve  got  fish”.  When fisherman’s son raises the hand and sees the fish grasped in the hand, he knows really as poisonous sea snake, due to seeing three striations on the neck. With full of fear and seeing on coming danger, after disenchanting to hold up sea snake, he wants to escape from danger, he undoes body of snake that winds around a hand, then he raises that hand up and weakens the sea snake by spinning two or three times above the head and throws away by shouting that “Oh! Bad snake … get out”. Afterwards, he climbs on the bank quickly and stands by seeing backwards and reasoning that “Oh!...friends… I’ve escaped from danger of big snake really”. (***Vs-2-2302***) 

Due to taking the object of ***nibbāna*** after abandoning on all conditioned things, the Knowledge  of  Trans-lineage  is  similar  to  the  manner,  giving  up  sea  snake.  It  should  be recognized the Noble Path-Knowledge as the manner, standing up by seeing backwards after giving up sea snake. The Noble Path-Knowledge takes the object of ***nibbāna*** through the nature of directly faces with object (***āramma***ṇ***a paṭivedha***). It sees itself called the Noble Path by means of non-delusive realization (***a-sammohapaṭivedha***). (due to eradication of delusion or ignorance which conceals on the Noble Path not to be known and seen by the Noble Path- Knowledge, itself, the enlightenment arises after disappearing of nescience. The function of knowing is also accomplished simultaneously and this process of knowing and seeing in this way  is  called  ***a-sammohapaṭivedha***).  Therefore  the  process  of  seeing  by  the  Noble  Path towards  ***nibbāna***  is  similar  to  the  manner  of  seeing  backwards  of  fisherman’s  son  after abandoning the sea snake. It should be recognized the Fruit-Knowledge as standing up on safe place. (With regarding to these words, it means a safe place has been reached but not practising for reaching to that safe place.) (***Vs-2-302, Mathāṭī-2-471***) 

3. ***gharam* = house** 

After  having  dinner,  when  an  owner  of  house  goes  to  bed  he  falls  asleep.  During sleeping the house is burnt down. When that owner of house wakes up and sees the fire, he is full of afraid of fire and serches the place to flee away from the house with reasoning that “if I flee before the body is fired, there will be no injury”, then he sees the fire escape and flees away rapidly and stands on a safe place. In that simile\_\_\_\_ obsession on five aggregates in a way that “I, my property”… , of stupid worldly person without eye of wisdom in the field of ultimate ***dhammas***, is similar to falling asleep of owner of house after having dinner and going to bed.  It should be recognized the occurrence  of Knowledge of Terror after seeing three general characters through practising the right course (***sammāpaṭipatti***) as fearful period by seeing the fire after awaking up, while the occurrence of three kinds of successive knowledge, the Knowledge of Desire for Deliverance, the Knowledge of reflection, the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations called ***santiṭṭhanā***, as searching the place to flee away; the Knowledge of Adaptation as seeing the fire escape; (due to occurrence of delivering from emblem of conditioned things of the Knowledge of Trans-lineage) the Knowledge of Trans- lineage as reaching on the fire escape; the Path-Knowledge as fleeing away rapidly, (due to association with special function which accomplishes both the place that is worth abandoning and  the  place  that  is  worth  reaching);  the  Fruit-Knowledge  as  standing  on  a  safe  place, respectively. (***Vs-2-302,303, Mahāṭī-2-471***) 

**PAGE-400** 

4. ***gô* = cow** 

While a peasant falls asleep at night his cows escape from the farm by breaking the fence. When that peasant goes and sees that farm in the early morning, he sees the occurrence of fleeing away of cows and follows to footprints of cows and sees the king’s cows. When he brings those cows of the king as he thinks those are his cows, at the morning with sunshine he recognizes cows of the king really but not his cows. He is full of  fear with the reasoning that “I have to flee away before persons in the service of the king seize and torture with suspect that I’m a thief” and he abandons cows, flees away and stands on a safe place. 

In that simile\_\_\_\_ it should be recognized on the obsession on aggregates of fivefold  clinging to existence of stupid worldly person without eye of wisdom in a way that "I, my property", as bringing the cows of the king by thinking that "my cows"; knowing on aggregates of fivefold clinging to existence as ***anicca, dukkha, anatta***, of the practising meditator as recognizing on cows of the king really at the morning with sunshine; the Knowledge of Terror, as the period with full of fear to be captured and killed by persons in the service of the king; the Knowledge of Desire for Deliverance as the occurrence of desiring to flee away after abandoning the cows; the Knowledge of Trans-lineage as abandoning the cows; the Noble Path-Knowledge as the manner of fleeing away; the Noble Fruit-Knowledge as standing on a safe place, respectively. (***Vs-2-303, Mah***āṭī ***-2-472***) 

5. ***yakkhī*** **= ogress** 

A man is married with an ogress (due to he did not know her as ogress). At night due to thinking that "this man falls asleep", that ogress goes to cemetery and eats the corpse. When that man searches and follows to his wife with thinking where she goes, he sees the manner of eating on corpse. Due to knowing on that ogress as not real human being, he is afraid of the ogress with reasoning that "I have to flee away before she eats me", and flees away rapidly, resulting in standing on a safe place. 

In that simile\_\_\_\_ it should be recognized on the obsession on aggregates of fivefold clinging to existence of stupid worldly person in a way that "I, my property"; as marriage with an ogress; knowing occurrence of the nature of ***anicca*** etc., after seeing the three general characters  of  aggregates,  as  knowing  that  "this  woman  is  actually  an  ogress"  after  seeing manner of  eating on corpse in the cemetery; the Knowledge of Terror, as the period with full of fear; the Knowledge of Desire for Deliverance as desire to fleeing away; the Knowledge of Trans-lineage as leaving cemetery; the Noble Path-Knowledge, as fleeing away rapidly; the Fruit-Knowledge, as standing on a safe place, respectively. (***Vs-2-303***) 

Due to occurrence of cause of discerning on the place with danger as safe one, it should be  recognized  the  occurrence  of  similarity  between  obsession  on  aggregates  as  "I,  my property:, and marriage with an ogress. 

**PAGE-401** 

It should be recognized on the fact that the Knowledge of Trans-lineage which arises by means of presence of the object of ***nibbāna*** after abandoning the cemetery called conditioned things as leaving cemetery. (***Mahāṭī-2-472***) 

6. ***dāraka* = boy** 

One woman has very strong loving-kindness on her son. While she is sitting in parlour she hears crying of a boy in the lane and thinks that "my son is tortured by someone", she goes quickly there and cuddles the crying kid of other with a perception as her son. Afterwards she remembers that kid is other's but not her son and looks around left him in the lane with full of fear to be accused as a thief of child and returns back to parlour and sits again. 

In the simile\_\_\_\_ it should be recognized on the obsession on aggregates of fivefold clinging  to  existence  in  a  way  that  "I,  my  property",  as  cuddling  the  kid  of  other  with perception as her son; knowing that "it is not I, it is not mine" through three general characters as knowing that "this kid is other's son"; the Knowledge of Terror as fear to be accused as a thief of child; the Knowledge of Desire for Deliverance as looking around; the Knowledge of Adaptation as leaving kid in the lane; (Due to removing conditioned things after removing grosser and grosser bulk of selfish desire, the Knowledge of Adaptation should be recognized as leaving the kid in that lane.); the Knowledge of Trans-lineage as a short period staying in the lane after leaving the kid; the Noble Path-Knowledge as returning back to parlour; the Noble Fruit-Knowledge as sitting in parlour again respectively. (***Vs-2-303,304, Mahāṭī-2-472***) 

**Remaining six kinds of similes** 

These six kinds of similes, viz, 

7. ***khudda*** = hunger** 
7. ***pipāsa*** = thirstiness 
7. ***sīta*** = cold climate** 
7. ***u***ṇ***ha*** = hot climate** 
7. ***andhakāra*** = cloud of darkness** 
7. ***visa*** = poison, are paralleled in order to be explicit the occurrence of inclination, bending, leading towards the Supra-mundane ***dhammas*** for the practising meditator who stands on the ***vipassanā***  Knowledge  leading  to  Emerging  and  reaches  to  the  Noble  Path-Knowledge.  (It means that these similes are not paralleled in order to be explicit fearful nature of the meditator who stands on the Knowledge of Terror as previous semilies.) It will be explicit.\_\_\_\_ 

**PAGE-402** 

7. ***khudda*** = hunger** 

As very hungry man has strong desire to eat flavourful nourishment\_\_\_\_ similarly, the *bhikkhu* who is oppressed by the hunger of occurrence in rounds of rebirth, has heartfelt desire on nourishment of ***kāyagatāsati*** (= mindfulness on all constituents of the body) which has the flavour of deathless element. (***Vs-2-304***) 

Due to occurrence of both successive process, following for a long time, and difficulty to be forborne, with reasoning that the suffering of rounds of rebirth is similar to suffering of hunger, the commentary said that "***samsāra vaṭṭajighicchāya*** = the hunger of occurrence in rounds of rebirth", as a metaphor. 

***amatarasam kāyagatāsatibhojanam*** 

***Pāli Quotation (Mahāṭī-2-472)*** 

In this case, that term, ***kāyagatāsati***, means the right minddulness (***sammāsati***) which is associating with the Noble Path-Knowledge. Due to occurrence of both by means of finishing the function called ***kāyānupassanā, vedanānupassanā, cittānupassanā, dhammānupassanā*** and by eating the taste of deathless element (***amatarasa***) of the eternal peace called ***nibbāna***, that mindfulness is worth designating as "***amatarasam kāyagatāsatibhojanam*** = nourishment of ***kāyagatāsati*** which has the flavour of deathless element". Therefore, in the ***Amata Vagga, Ekanipāta, Anguttara (Ang-1-47)***, the Buddha preached that… 

"***amatam te bhikkhave paribuñjanti, ye kāyagatāsatim paribuñjanti.***" = *bhikkhus* … such persons eat the nourishment of ***kāyagatāsati***, it can be said that persons eat the flavour of deathless element of ***nibbāna***". (***Mahāṭī-2-472***) 

**Question \_\_\_\_ *Nibbāna*** is a Supramundane ***dhammas, kāyagatāsati***, on the other hand, is mundane ***dhammas***. How those persons who eat the mourishment of that ***kāyagatāsati*** can eat the flavour of deathless element of ***nibbāna***? 

**Answer**  \_\_\_\_  Those  persons  who  develop  ***kāyagatāsati***  can  attain  the  deathless  element ***nibbāna***. It is not available for the person who does not develop anymore. Therefore, the Buddha preached in this way. (***Aṅg-A-1-416***) 

It has already explained frequently in previous section the fact that if ***kāyānupassanā*** ***satipaṭṭhāna*** (= contemplation on the all constituents of body) is accomplished to be developed all four kinds of contemplation(***satiapaṭṭhāna***) will be fulfilled simultaneously. If every kind of contemplation is accomplished to be developed systematically, the function of development of all four kinds of contemplation is also fulfilled simultaneously. When it is reaching to the Noble Path (-moment), that Noble Path eradicates delusion which conceals on 

**PAGE-403** 

four kinds of objects, the standing places of mindfulness, viz, ***kāya, vedanā, citta, dhamma,*** , not  to  be  known,  resulting  in  disappearing  of  nescience  called  ***avijjā***  and  appearing  of enlightenment called ***vijj***ā. This way of processes is said that finishing the function of four kinds of contemplation, ***kāyānupassanā*** etc., by the mindfulness, which associates with the Noble Path. Right mindfulness which associates with mundane ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge can remove defilements temporarily, resulting in inability to perform that function completely, due to lack of ability to see ***nibbāna***. Therefore above exegeses are performed in commentary and subcommentary. 

8. ***pipāsa* = thirstiness \_\_\_\_** As a thirsty man with very absorbent buccal cavity and throat has heartfelt desire for drink, juice, fruits of eastern goose berry, ginger etc., similarly, \_\_\_\_ this practising meditator who is oppressed by thirstiness of rounds of rebirth also has heartfelt desire for cordial of Noble Path with eight factors. (***Vs-2-304***) 
8. ***sīta* = cold climate** \_\_\_ As a man who is oppressed by very cold climate has heartfelt desire for warmness, similarly \_\_\_\_ this practising meditator who is oppressed by coldness of strong attainment on rounds of rebirth also has heartfelt desire for the fire of Noble Path which can burn defilement totally. (***Vs-2-304***) 
8. ***u***ṇ***ha* = hot climate** \_\_\_\_ As a man who is oppressed by very hot climate has heartfelt desire for coldness, similarly \_\_\_\_ this practising meditator who is oppressed by (11)kinds of fire of rounds of rebirth also has heartfelt desire for Eternal Peace called ***nibbāna*** where those 

   11) kinds of fire, fire of passion, fire of anger etc., are extinguished.(***Vs-2-304***) 
11. ***andhakāra* = cloud of darkness** \_\_\_\_ As a man who is oppressed by cloud of darkness which has four kinds of situation, viz, occurrence of midnight, occurrence of new moon day, occurrence in the midst of deep forest, occurrence of raining without any lightening but full of bulk of clouds in all directions, has heartfelt desire for light, similarly \_\_\_\_ this practising meditator who is concealed by cloud of darkness called ignorance which is able to conceal Four Noble Truths not to be known, also has heartfelt desire for the advancement of Path (***maggabhāvan***ā) with light of wisdom. (***Vs-2-304***) 

***Pāli Quotation (Mahāṭī-2-472) (Vs-2-304)*** 

The  Noble  Path-Knowledge  called  ***maggabhāvanā***  has  shining  light  produced  by knowledge  (***Vs-2-304,  Mahāṭī-2-472***)  (It  is  really  the  brightness  of  colour-object  of  both corporeal units produced by mind of meditation called consciousness of Path (-moment) which 

PAGE16 

is  predominated  with  knowledge,  and  corporeal  units  produced  by  temperature  that  is consisting in those corporeal units produced by mind successively. It is a metaphorical usage called ***kāranūpacāra*** in which the name of cause, the knowledge without light, is applied metaphorically on the name of result, corporealities produced by mind with bright colour- objects.) 

**PAGE-404** 

12. ***visa* = poison** \_\_\_ As a man who is oppressed by poison, snake venom etc., has heartfelt desire  for  antidote,  similarly  this  practising  *bhikkhu*  who  is  oppressed  by  the  venom  of defilements also has heartfelt desire for deathless elements, ***nibbāna***, which can be designated as a medicine that suppress venom of defilements for accomplishment of deathless state. (***Vs-2- 304***) 

**The person with shrinking mind** 

By way of practice as shown in this extent, it can be designated on this meditator as a person who practises through the occurrence of shrinking mind for various circumstance, life etc., With referring to that kind of person, the following verse is preached by the Buddha. 

***Pāli Quotation (Khu-1-406, Mahāni-100)*** 

***Bhikkhave =** Bhikkhus…* , *yo bhikkhu* = a such *bhikkhu;**na dassaye*** = never show or see; ***attānam*** = self-identity of himself; ***bhave*** = in three realms. ***buddhādayo*** = Noble Ones, the Buddha etc., ***āhu*** = ***kathenti*** = praise; ***tam = adassanam*** = that invisible situation of self- identity of himself in three realms; ***tassabhikkhuno*** = of that practising *bhikkhu*; ***bajamānassa*** 

- who approaches; ***vivittamāsanam*** = to place where is secluded both physically and mentally; ***paṭilīnacarassa*** = who can practise with shrinking mind for three realms; ***paṭirūpam*** = is very favourable one. 

*Bhikkhus…*a such *bhikkhu* never show or see self-identity of himself in three realms.  Noble Ones, the Buddha etc., praise; that invisible situation of self-identity of himself in three realms of that practising *bhikkhu* who approaches to place where is secluded both physically and mentally who can practise with shrinking mind for three realms, is very favourable one.  

30. **Differences of *bojjhanga, magganga, jhānaṅga,paṭipdā*** ***and vimokkha (Vs-2-305)***  

The  meditator  with  the  Knowledge  of  Neutrality  Towards  Formations  that  can neutralize on conditioned things through free from two kinds of extremeties, terror-attachment (***bhaya-nand***ī)  can  be  designated  as  the  person  who  practices  through  the  occurrence  of shrinking mind for three kinds of existences (***paṭilīnacara puggala***), due to lack of any kind of heartfelt desire on all conditioned things occurring in three realms but presence of shrinking mind with very weak inner desire for those existences. 

Thus, after performing the occurrence of a person with shrinking mind one-sidedly and certainly,  the  Knowledge  of  Neutrality  Towards  Formations  can  be  accomplished  fixedly significant differences of the following factors, 

1. (6) factors of Enlightenment, (7) factors of Enlightenment (***bojjhaṅga***) 
1. (8) factors of path, (7) factors of path (***magganga***) 
1. (5) factors of Absorption, (4) factors of Absorption (***jhānanga***) 

**PAGE-405** 

4. way of practices (***paṭipad***ā) 
4. way of deliverance (***vimokkha***), which are available for the Noble Path (-moment) and for  predisposition  of  the  upper  kinds  of  Noble  Path.  Detailed  accounts  are  as follows.\_\_\_\_ 
1. Some  teachers,  such  as  ***Tipiṭaka  Cūlanāga  Mahā***  ***Thero***  etc.,  said  that  fundamental absorption  (***pādaka  jhāna***)  which  is  fundamental  of  “***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to Emerging”,  predetermines  the  significance  and  differences  of  numbers  of  factors  of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption, which are available at the Noble Path(-moment). 

[Notes: \_\_\_\_ For instance, in this work , fourth absorption of mindfulness of breathing is presented as the fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā*** practice. In this case, it means this kind  of  absorption.  For  a  meditator  with  mastery  in  all  eight  kinds  of  attainments  (***aṭṭha samāpatti***), every kind of absorption can be applied as fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā*** practice easily.] 

2. Some teachers, such as ***Moravāpīvāsī*** ***Mahādatta Mahā*** ***Thero*** etc., said that aggregates which  are  objects  of  “***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  leading  to  Emerging”,  predetermines  the significance and difference of numbers of factors of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption, which are available at the Noble Path (-moment). 
2. Some  teachers,  such  as  ***Tipi***tttt***aka  C***ūllllā***bhaya  Mahā***  ***Thero***  etc.,  said  that  if  there  are difference between the fundamental Absorption and mastered Absorption (***sammasita jhāna***) which is the object of “***Vipassanā*** Knowledge leading to Emerging”, the individual preference of practising meditator (***puggalajjhāsaya***) predetermines the significance and differences of numbers of factors of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption, which are available at the Noble Path (-moment). 

Among those opinions of three Noble teachers it should be recognized the fact that only “***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  leading  to  Emerging”  which  occurs  previously  the  Noble  Path, predetermines the significance and differences of numbers of factors of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption.  In  order  to  recognize  those  significance  of  factors  of  Enlightenment  etc.,  the followings are explanations in sequence called ***anupubbikath***ā. 

1. **Opinion of the first Thero – Opinion of fundamental absorption (*pādakajjhāna vāda*)** 

These three kinds of Noble Path, viz, 

1. The Noble Path which occurs in the continuum of the person with pure ***vipassanā*** (***sukkha vipassanā***) who lacks any kind of absorption but vehicle of purified ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge only, 
1. The Noble Path which occurs in the continuum of the person with absorption, who does not apply acquired absorption as the fundamental of ***vipassanā*** practice, and 
1. Noble Path which occurs in the continuum of the person with the first absorption during the generalizing on miscellineous conditioned things other than the acquired first absorption after changing  to  ***vipassanā***  practice  by  using  first  absorption  as  the  fundamental  of  ***vipassanā*** practice, 

are associated with the first absorption. Those three kinds of Noble Path consist of (7) factors of Enlightenment, (8) factors of Path, (5) factors of Absorption respectively. (***Vs—2- 305***) 

**PAGE-406**  

[Notes: \_\_\_\_ In this case, ***sukkha vipassaka*** person means ***suddha vipassanāyānika***  (= the  person  with  vehicle  of  pure  ***vipassanā***  practice)  who  lacks  any  kind  of  absorption. Miscellineous conditioned things(***paki***ṇṇ***aka saṅkhāra***) means all kinds of conditioned things occurring in three realms, which are worth discerning as the object of ***vipassanā*** practice, other than conditioned things consisting in the first absorption of any kind of meditation subject. During discerning on those miscellaneous conditioned things, if the Noble Path is attained, it associates with the first absorption. If the Noble Path is attained during discerning on the first 

absorption which is the fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā*** practice, it is nothing to say whether it associates with the first absorption or not. In this case, the words, “the Noble Path of the person with pure ***vipassanā*** associates with the first absorption”, etc., are said in order to show “***vipassanā*** ***niyama*** has a single fixed effect that \_\_\_\_ “significance and differences of factors of Enlightenment, Path etc., are predetermined by ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge leading to Emerging”. It is right.\_\_\_\_ Pure fundamental absorption etc., which are primary causes for predisposition of numbers of factors of Enlightenment, Path etc., of the Noble Path, excluding ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge leading to Emerging, can never be seen actually. Especially, ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge leading to Emerging can occur as primary cause for occurrence of the associatin of the  Noble  Path  with  the  first  absorption  for  the  person  with  vehicle  of  pure  ***vipassanā*** knowledge although fundamental absorption etc, are absent in him. Therefore  it should be recognized the fact that only “***Vipassanā*** Knowledge leading to Emerging”, is a definite cause with a certain effect for predisposition of significance and differences of numbers of factors of Enlightenment Path etc., of the Noble Path. (***Mahāṭī-2-474***) 

It will be explicit. \_\_\_\_ Previous practice of ***vipassanā*** (***pubbabhāga vipassanā***) that occurs  beforehand  those  kinds  of  Noble  Path,  may  be  associated  with  mentally  agreeable feeling or neutrality  feeling. When the Noble Path-Knowledge called ***vuṭṭhāna*** (emerging) arises, in the next method \_\_\_ when ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging arises after reaching to occurrence of Neutrality Towards Formations, it always associates with mentally agreeable feeling really. (***Vs-2-305***) 

4. For the pentad method (***pa***vvvv***caka naya***), at the Noble Path (-moment) which is accomplished by performing the second absorption as the fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā***, it associates with four factors of Absorption, viz, ***vicāra, pīti, sukha, ekaggatā.*** 
4. At the Noble Path (-moment) which is accomplished by performing the third absorption as the fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā***, it associates with three factors of Absorption, viz, ***pīti, sukha, ekaggatā.*** 
4. At the Noble Path (-moment) which is accomplished by performing the fourth absorption as the fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā***, it associates with two factors of Absorption, viz, ***sukha, ekaggatā.*** 

Especially,  at  moment  of  those  kinds  of  Noble  Path,  which  are  accomplished  by performing second absorption, third absorption, fourth absorption, as fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā*** it associates with (7) factors of Path only, [due to lack of factor of absorption called ***vitakka,*** resulting in lacking in factor of Path, right thought (***sammā*** ***sankappa***).] At the Noble Path (-moment) which is accomplished by performing fourth absorption as fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā***, it associates with (6) factors of Enlightenment, (due to lack of ***pīti***). This  significant  difference  is  predetermined  by  not  only  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  leading  to Emerging (=***vipassanā*** ***niyama***) but also fundamental absorption (= ***pādakajhāna niyama***). (It means that is not predetermined by ***vipassanā*** ***niyama*** only as shown in Noble Path of previous three kinds of persons, ***sukkhavipassaka*** person etc.) 

**PAGE 407** 

It  is  right.\_\_\_\_  For  that  pentad  method,  previous  practice  of  ***vipassanā***  before  the moment  of  Noble  Path,  which  are  accomplished  by  performing  second  absorption,  third absorption, fourth absorption, as fundamental absorptions of ***vipassanā***, can associate with either  mentally  agreeable  feeling  or  neutrality  feeling.  However,  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge Leading to Emerging always associates with mentally agreeable feeling only. (***Vs-2-305***) 

7. Then at the Noble Path (-moment) which is accomplished by performing fourth absorption in the aspect of tetrad method, fifth absorption in the aspect of pentad method, as fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā,*** there are two factors of absorption by means of ***upekkhā, ekaggatā,*** while (6) factors of Enlightenment, due to lack of ***pītisambojjhaṅga***, (7) factors of Path, due to lack of ***sammāsankappa magganga***, respectively. These significant differences in numbers of factors  of  absorption,  Enlightenment,  Path  are  predetermined  by  efficiency  of  both ***pādakajhānaniyama***  (fundamental  absorption  of  ***vipassanā***)  and  ***vipassanā***  ***niyama* (*Vipassan***ā** Knowledge leading to Emerging). It is right. \_\_\_\_ In this case, previous practice of ***vipassanā*** before the Noble Path (***pubbabhāga vipassanā***) can associate not only mentally agreeable  feeling  but  also  neutrality  feeling.  However,  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to Emerging always associates with neutrality feeling. (***Vs-2-306***) 
7. Those Noble Paths which are accomplished by performing absorptions of immaterial sphere as fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā must also be recognized in this way similarly. 

Thus after emerging from fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā*** practice, the absorption which emerges from adjacent place (***āsanna padesa***) of the Noble Path which is accomplished by discerning and generalizing on all conditioned things occurring in three realms, which are called ***ye keci saṅkāra***, can perform the Noble Path in order to similar with itself. It is similar to the way that the colour of ground performs the same colour of monitor lizard with it's colour. (***Vs-2-306, see Abhi-A-1-271,272***) 

If dwelling hole of monitor lizard is red soil, the latter makes the former to be red colour because it is the most adjacent to the monitor lizard; then if dwelling hole is black soil, it makes the colour of monitor lizard to be black one adaptationally. It means that it should be recognized in this simile. 

In  this  case,  the  word,  ***āsannapadesa*  (*=***  adjacent  place),  refers  to  ***Vipassan***ā** Knowledge Leading to Emerging. Thus, with regarding to the word, ***āsannapadesa*** (adjacent place), it show that there are no significant difference in numbers of factors of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption of the Noble Path, due to efficiency of absorptions which are entered by practising person at interval (***Mahāṭī-2-474***) 

There are the explanations relating to the first Mahā Thero called ***Tipitaka C***ūļ***anāga Mahā*** ***Thero***. The essence of this opinion is as follows.\_\_\_\_ 

If "***Vipassan***ā** Knowledge Leading to Emerging", that is adjacent to the Noble Path is associated with mentally agreeable feeling, the Noble Path will also associate with mentally agreeable feeling. (In the aspect of pentad method, those Noble Paths will associate with any kinds of absorption, first absorption, second absorption, third absorption, or fourth absorption accordingly.) 

**PAGE-408** 

If "***Vipassan***ā** Knowledge Leading to Emerging", that is adjacent to the Noble Path is associated with neutrality feeling, the Noble Path will also associates with neutrality feeling. In the  pentad  method,  it  is  the  Noble  Path  which  associates  with  the  fifth  absorption (***pañcamajhānika  magga***),  indeed.  Therefore,  significance  and  differences  in  factors  of Enlightenment etc., occour at the Noble Path (-moment) consequently. Thus when ***Vipassan***ā** Knowledge Leading to Emerging predetermines significance and differences in numbers of factors of Enlightenment etc., although it occurs as; 

1. not only proximate factor (***āsanna kāra***nnnn***a***) 
1. but also significant factor (***padhānakāra***nnnn***a***) those factors, fundamental absorption etc., on the  other  hand,  are  not  proximate  and  significant  factor.  However,  in  the  absence  of fundamental absorption, only ***Vipassan***ā** Knowledge  Leading to Emerging is unable to predetermine  significant  differences  of  factors  of  Enlightenment,  Path,  Absorption,  as mentioned above. (It means that after entering into absorption and emerging from that absorption  and  then  only  when  that  absorption  and  conditioned  things  which  are associating with absorption, are discerned as objects of ***vipassanā*** practice, various kinds of those significant differences can be occurred consequently.) Actually, as mentioned above, fundamental  absorption  is  significant  factor  of  predetermination  of  factors  of Enlightenment  etc.,  of  the  Noble  Path  (-moment).  Therefore  the  commentary  did  not explain  that  at  the  Noble  Path  (-moment)  various  significant  numbers  of  factors  of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption are predetermined by ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging"  only  definitely  but  it  explained  that  "***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to Emerging" predetermines it generally.( ***Mahāṭī-2-473,474***) 
2. **Opinion  of  the  second  Thero  \_\_  Opinion  of  mastered  absorption  (*sammasita jhānavāda*)** 

In  the  next  kind  \_\_\_\_  in  the  opinion  of  the  second  ***Mahā***  ***Thero,  Moravāpīvāsī*** ***Mahādatta Mahā*** ***Thero***, it means that \_\_\_\_ after emerging from such absorption, if the Noble Path is accomplished by performing ***vipassanā*** practice through discerning and generalizing on conditioned  things  called  absorption  and  associated  ***dhammas***  occurring  in  such  such absorption, that Noble Path will be similar to mastered absorption which is discerned as object of ***vipassan*** practice. If sensual sphere ***dhammas*** are discerned as object of ***vipassanā*** practice and  the  Noble  Path  is  attained  at  that  time,  that  Noble  Path  will  associate  with  the  first absorption only. In that opinion of second ***Thero***, it should be recognized on ***vipassanā*** ***niyama*** as mentioned in the opinion of the first ***Thero*** similarly. (***Vs-2-306, Abhi-A-1-272***) 

In  this  case,  the  word,  ***vipassanā***,  means  "***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to Emerging", which is the last part of the Knowledge of Neutrality  Towards Formations, indeed. ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge of a practising person who discerns any kind of conditioned things as ***anicca*** etc., by performing the second absorption as fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā***, is called ***vitakkavirāga*** ***bhāvanā*** (= the practice of ***vipassanā*** that disgusts on initial application which is surpassed by the second absorption). Therefore the Noble Path which is accomplished by performing ***vipassanā*** practice on that absorption is also the Noble Path which associates with  the  second  absorption  lacking  initial  application.  It  should  be  recognized  on  various absorption, third absorption etc., in similar way. In this way, in the opinion of the first ***Thero*** called  opinion  of  fundamental  absorption,  "***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to  Emerging", predetermines difference of feelings, i.e., mentally agreeable feeling, neutrality feeling, and numbers of factors of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption. Depending upon this method, it should be paralled the way of predetermination of "***Vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging" for the next opinion similarly. (see ***Mūlatī-1-115***) 

**PAGE-404** 

3. **Opinion  of  the  third  Thero  =  Opinion  of  individual  preferentail  absorption (*puggalajjhāsaya jhānavāda*)** 

In the opinion of the third ***Thero, Tipitaka C***ūļā***bhaya Mahā*** ***Thero***,\_\_\_ the individual preference that … 

* "***aho vatāham saṭṭangikam maggam p***aaaa***puneyam, aṭṭangikam maggam  pāpuneyam***"** 
- "If  I  reach  the  Noble  Path  that  associates  with the  second  absorption  and  seven 

factors of Path, it is very delightful one. If I reach the Noble Path that associates with the first absorption and eight factors of Path, it is very delightful one" \_\_\_\_ Thus a kind of individual preferrence has been performed and depending on which the Noble Path is accomplished by performing  such  such  absorption  as  fundamental  absorption  of  ***vipassanā***  practice  and  by discerning on such such  ***dhammas*** of absorption, and then it is similar to that absorption really.  In  the  absence  of  either  fundamental  absorption  or  mastered  absorption  on  which ***vipassanā*** practice is performed, only individual preference is unable to accomplish the Noble Path  with  the  same  factors  as  that  preferential  absorption.  [When  it  is  accomplished  by individual preference, if fundamental absorption is present, that absorption benefits individual preference, or if mastered absorption is present, that absorption benefits individual preference; by  means  of  efficiency  of  relation  of  natural  determinative  dependence  (***pakatūpanissaya paccaya***). Therefore it means that only when any kind of absorption, fundamental or mastered absorption, benefits by means of efficiency of relation of natural determinative dependence, it can be accomplished in accordance with the individual preference actually.] 

The  meaning  that  "  in  the  absence  of  either  fundamental  absorption  or  mastered absorption on which ***vipassanā*** practice is performed, only individual preference is unable to accomplish the Noble Path with the same factors as that preferential absorption", can be proved by ***Nandakovāda Sutta*** as follows. 

In  ***Nandakovāda  Sutta,  Salāyatana  Vagga,  Uparipannāsa,  Majjhima  Nikāya,***  The Buddha preached that – 

"*Bhikkhus* …. the worldly similile is that \_\_\_\_ as in the continuum of people, a kind of reasoning, "at the full-moon day the moon appears full really", always occur without any doubt that whether the moon appears fully at full-moon day or not, *bhikkhus* ….similarly, those *bhikkhun*i*s*  are both pleased  and completed intention by  preaching of  Venerable ***Nandaka Thero.*** *Bhikkhus* ….among those 500 *bhikkhun*i*s*, such *bhikkhun*i is the last one in the status, and then that *bhikkhuni* is the Noble one called upstream-enterer without the nature of falling in disorder for future life but she has fixed perspective of three Upper kinds of Noble Path- Knowledge called ***sammattaniyama,*** indeed (*M*-3-324) 

It will be explicit.\_\_\_ Among those 500 *bhikkhun*i*s*, in the continuum of corporeality and mentality of such *bhikkhun*i, the relation of determinative dependence for attainment of the Fruit-Knowledge of Upstream-enterer is present apparently; that *bhikkhun*i has completed her intention with the Noble Fruit of Upstream-enterer. ..R … In the continuum of corporeality and mentality of such *bhikkhun*i, the relation of determinative dependence for attainment of the Fruit-Knowledge of Arahant is present apparently; that *bhikkhun*i has completed her intention with the Noble Fruit of Arahant. **PAGE 410** (It means in the presence of only the intention and heartfelt desire, the Noble Path and Fruit can not be available but only when efficiency of relation  of  determinative  dependence  is  also  completed,  the  Noble  Path  and  Fruit  can  be available.) 

Similarly,  the  Noble  Path,  which  is  accomplished  by  the  practicing  meditator  who performs  either  such  such  absorption  as  fundamental  absorption,  or  ***vipassanā***  practice  by discerning  on  such  such  absorption  and  associating  ***dhammas,***  is  the  same  as  that  that absorption really. However, it should be recognized the fact that merely presence of individual preference called desire to become Upstream-enterer, desire to become Once-returnee, desire to become Non-returnee, desire to become Arahant, excluding fundamental absorption and mastered absorption, the occurrence of Noble Path with the same factors of that that absorption can not be accomplished really. In this opinion of individual preferential absorption (***puggala- jjhāsayavāda***), it should be recognized on ***vipassanā*** ***niyama*** as mentioned above similarly. **(*Abhi-A*-1-273)** 

In  that  ***Nandakovāda  Sutta***,  among  those  *bhikkhun*i*s*,  those  ones  who  become Upstream-enterer, by listening on ***dhamma*** addressed by Venerable ***Nandaka***, their intentions, for attainment of Ariyahood called Upstream-enterer, are also completed as their intention really.  Those  ones  who  become  once  returnees,  Non-returnees,  Arahants  are  also  pleased similarly  through  occurring  as  Once-returnees,  Non-returnees,  Arahants,  by  listening  on ***dhamma***  addressed  by  Venerable  ***Nandaka***.  Their  intentions,  for  attainment  of  Ariyahood called once-returnee, Non-returnee, Arahant, are also completed with acquired Supra-mundane Path-Knowledge  and  Fruit-Knowledge  in  that  way  is  due  to  presence  of  efficiency  of  the relation of natural determinative dependence for attainment of Ariyahood of Upstream-Enterer, Once returnee, Non-returnee, Arahant in previous existences. Similarly \_\_ in the aspect of this supra-mundane  Path-knowledge,  due  to  presence  of  efficiency  of  relation  of  natural determinative  dependence  of  fundamental  absorption  or  mastered  absorption,  individual preference that has heartfelt desire on the Noble Path with the same factors of Absorption as fundamental absorption or mastered absorption occours in him. It means it explained to refer the occurrence of the Noble Path that conforms to that kind of individual preference. (***Mūla***ttttī***- 1-116, Mah***āttttī***-2-475***) 

4. **Analysis on opinion of Tipitaka C**ū**lan**ā**ga Mah**ā **Thero** 

**Question \_\_\_\_** Among those three ***Mahā*** ***Theras***, the closest disciples asked ***Tipitaka C***ūllll***a nāga Thero*** who always says that "only fundamental absorption predetermines significance and differences in numbers of factors of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption at the Noble Path (- moment)", as follows. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

"Venerable  Sir,  in  the  existence  with  fundamental  absorption,  it  may  be  sure  that fundamental absorption predetermines significance and differences of numbers of factors of enlightenment, Path, Absorption at the Noble Path (--moment) previously. 

PAGE –411 

However,  in  the  existences  of  immaterial  sphere  without  fundamental  absorption,  which ***dhamma*** predetermines significance and difference of numbers of factors of enlightenment, Path, Absorption at the Noble Path (-moment).?" 

It should be recognized the fact that this question is asked with referring to absence of lower fundamental absorptions, other than the fourth absorption, in the aspect of tetrad method, in the Immaterial Sphere. In the Immaterial Sphere all four kinds of absorptions are fourth absorptions consisting each two factors of absorption, ***upekkhā, ekaggata,*** respectively. In the immaterial sphere, for the Noble Path which associates with that fourth absorption, respective absorption of immaterial sphere for each realm can be occurred as the fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā*** practice. In accordance with tetrad method, due to occurrence of possibility of fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā*** practice is respective absorption of immaterial sphere, that  belongs  to  the  fourth  absorption,  the  Noble  Path,  which  is  accomplished  in  those immaterial sphere, will consist of (6) factors of enlightenment, (7) factors of Path, (2) factors of Absorption, viz, ***upekkhā*** ***ekaggatā constantly. Depending on fundamental absorption, no significance and difference can be occurred. (It is due to presence of two factors of Absorption in all four immaterial spheres.) Therefore closest disciples asked that question with referring to the  fact  that  in  the  immaterial  sphere,  at  the  Noble  Path  (-moment),  there  can  be  neither significance  nor  differences  in  numbers  of  factors of  Enlightenment,  Path,  Absorption  but unique kind only. In order to be understood the answer of this question, the fact to be known beforehand is that \_\_\_\_ the worldly person with three  roots existing in immaterial sphere (***arūpatihetuka puthujana puggala)*** is unable to attain the Noble Path of Upstream-enterer, due  to  lack  of  supporting  factor  of  listening  ***dhamma***  addressed  by  any  Noble  One,  The Buddha etc., called "***paratoghosa***". After attaining the Path of upstream-enterer during existing in  five-groups-existence  called  sensual  sphere  and  fine-material  sphere,  if  he  reaches  to immaterial sphere through that five-group-existence, upper Noble Path-knowledge and Fruit- Knowledge can be attained by successive practising in that immaterial sphere. Then it can be understood the following answer easily. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

**Answer** \_\_\_\_\_ Ā*vuso …* in those existences of immaterial spheres also, at the Noble Path (- moment)  only  the  fundamental  absorption  predetermines  significance  and  differences  of numbers of factors of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption, indeed. It is right. After a practising *bhikkhu* has got eight attainments (***a***tttttttt***hasamāpatti***) and the Noble Path and Fruit of Upstream- enterer are accomplished by performing the first absorption as the fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā*** practice, and then if he reaches into the existence of immaterial sphere when he 

passes away with that absorption of immaterial sphere; after entering into Fruition Absorption of Upstream-enterer again in that immaterial sphere, if upper three kinds of Path-Knowledge and Fruit-Knowledge are accomplished through performing ***vipassanā*** practice by emerging from that Fruition-Absorption of Upstream-enterer; those kinds of upper Path-Knowledge and Fruit-Knowledge will associate with the first absorption really. (It means that those consist of five factors of absorption.) Those kinds of Path and Fruit which associate with the second absorption etc.., are also in this way similarly. ( In the five-groups-existence, after attaining the Fruit-Knowledge of Upstream-enterer by performing the second absorption as the fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā*** practice, and then he reaches into immaterial sphere and continues to perform  ***vipassanā  practice,  resulting  in  attaining  upper  kinds  of  Noble  Path  and  Fruits consequently. At those Noble Path (-moment), it associates with the second absorption and consists of three factors of absorption. It should be understood in this way.) 

Due to presence of reasonable questions that "is there only the fifth absorption in the aspect of pentad method, the fourth absorption in the aspect of tetrad method in the immaterial sphere?", and then "why the second absorption can be present?, the ***Mahā*** ***Thero*** continued to answer as follows. \_\_\_\_ 

"In the immaterial sphere, in the aspect of tetrad method, triad absorptions (***tikajhāna***) called first absorption, second absorption, third absorption; in the aspect of pentad method, tetrad absorptions (***catukkajhāna***) called first absorption, second absorption, third absorption, forth absorption can occur really. Those triad absorptions, tetrad absorptions are also actually, **PAGE-412** Supra-mundane absorptions only. [It means the absorption which associates with the  Noble  Path  (-moment).  It  refers  to  factors  of  Absorption,  (5),  (4),  (3),  (2)  which  are associating  with  the  Noble  Path  at  those  Noble  Path  (-moment).]  Those  are  not  mundane absorption. Āvuso … thus … in those immaterial sphere, the fundamental absorption only predetermines  significance  and  differences,  of  numbers  of  factors  of  Enlightenment,  Path, Absorption at the Noble Path )(-moment) really"., said by the ***Maha Thero***. 

The closest disciples asked that "Venerable Sir… you have disentangle the problem well".(***Abhi-A-1-273,274***) 

5. **Analysis on opinion of *Moravāpīvāsī*** ***Mahādatta Mahā*** ***Thero*** 

"Aggregates, which are objects of ***vipassanā*** practice, predetermines significance and differences of numbers of factors of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption at the Noble Path (- moment). It is right.\_\_\_\_ By discerning on such aggregate as the object of ***vipassanā*** practice, the Noble Path called ***vuṭṭhāna*** arises and that Noble Path is similar to that aggregate discerned by ***vipassanā*** practice consequently". 

Venerable ***Mahā*** ***datta Mahā*** ***Thero*** who always says in this way was asked by his closest disciples as follows.\_\_\_\_ 

"Venerable Sir … your opinion of mastered absorption (***sammasitajhānavāda***), which means that the Noble Path which has the same numbers of factors of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption as the object of the ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge, has apparent fault. It is right.\_\_\_\_ The Noble Path of the practising *bhikkhu* who reaches to the Noble Path called ***vuṭṭh***aaaa***na***, due to emerging from conditioned things and ***pavatta*** by discerning on corporeal ***dhammas*** as ***anicca, dukkha, anatta***, may be similar to corporeal ***dhammas*** and ***avyākata dhammas***. The Noble Path of the practising *bhikkhu* who reaches to the Noble Path called ***vuṭṭhāna,*** due to emerging from conditioned things and ***pavatta*** by discerning on the absorption of neither-perception-nor –non-perception  through  ***kalāpasammasana***  method  as  a  whole,  should  be  similar  to  that absorption of neither-perception-nor-non-perception". 

" Āvuso … It will not occur in this way. It is because of the fact that\_\_\_\_ there is no Supra-mundane  Noble  Path  which  never  reach  to  full absorption  (***appan***ā).  Therefore,  the Noble Path called ***vuṭṭhāna*** by discerning on corporeal ***dhammas*** as ***anicca, dukkha, anatta***, is the  Path  with  eight  factors  of  Path  and  mentally  agreeable  feeling  called  ***aṭṭhangika somanassa sahagata magga.*** Then the Noble Path of meditator who attains the Noble Path, due to emerging from conditioned things by discerning on the absorption of neither-perception- nor-non-perception through ***kalāpasammasana*** method as a whole, can not be identical with that absorption by means of ***saṅkhārāvasesa*** (= occurrence of very subtle conditioned things) but  can  be  similar  to  that  absorption  by  means  of  occurrence  of  fourth  absorption  with neutrality  feeling,  resulting  in  occurring  as  the  Noble  Path  with  (7)  factors  and  neutrality feeling called ***sattangika upekkhā*** ***sahagata ariya magga*** only", said by the ***Mahā*** ***Thero (Abhi-A-1-274)*** 

**PAGE-413** 

Factors of relation of determinative dependence of the Noble Path for overcoming on gross factors of Absorption, ***vitakka*** etc., are those kinds of absorptions, the second absorption etc., which are discerned objects of ***Vipassanā*** Knowledge. When corporeal ***dahammas*** are discerned as ***anicca*** etc., due to absence of performing on absorption of fine material sphere as fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā*** practice and due to absence of performing ***vipassanā*** practice  on  the  object  of  absorption  of  fine  material  sphere,  if  efficiency  of  relation  of determinative dependence for overcoming on various kinds of factors of absorption is also absent, efficiency of non-attachment (***virāga***) called disgusting on various kinds of factors of absorption is absent, resulting in inability to occur without (5) factors of absorption. Therefore only the Noble Path with (8) factors of Path called ***aṭṭhangika magga*** 

is possible to occur and then it is said that "***aṭṭhangiko somanassasahagata maggo hoti*** = the Noble Path with (8) factors of Path and mentally agreeable feeling arises. Furthermore, if the Noble  Path  is  reached  by  discerning  on  the  absorption  of  neither-perception-nor-non- perception as object of ***vipassanā*** practice, although that Noble Path is the fourth absorption with (2) factors of Absorption called ***upekkhā, ekaggatā***, that Noble Path, which can eradicate underlying tendency of practising *bhikkhu*, can not be identical with the absorption of neither- perception-not-non-perception by means of occurrence of subtle conditioned things but it can similar as fourth absorption and associated with neutrality feeling. This meaning is shown by the word "***upekkhā*** ***sahagata magga",*** (***Abhi-A-1-274***) apparently. (***Mūlatī-1-116***) 

6. **Analysis on opinion of *Tipiṭaka C***ūļā***bhaya Mahā*** ***Thero*** 

The opinion of ***Tipiṭaka C***ūļā***bhaya Mahā*** ***Thero*** who always says that "individual preferential  absorption  predetermines  significance  and  differences  in  number  of  factors  of Enlightenment,  Path,  Absorption  at  the  Noble  Path  (-moment)  was  carried  and  asked  to ***Tipiṭaka C***ūļā***n***aaaa***ga Mahā*** ***Thero***. That ***Mahā*** ***Thero*** said as follows. \_\_\_ 

"In  the  continuum  of  such  practising  meditator,  the  fundamantal  absorption  of ***vipassanā*** practice is already present. In the continuum of that *bhikkhu*, the absorption which is discerned  as  object  of  ***vipassanā  practice  in  accordance  with  individual  preference  of  the *bhikkhu*, may predetermine actually the significance and differences in numbers of factors of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption at the Noble Path (-moment). In the continuum of practising *bhikkhu* without that fundamental absorption, which kind of individual preferential absorption can predetermine significance and differences of numbers of factors of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption at the Noble Path (-moment)? It is similar to the time for performing prosperity of poor person without investment", said by ***C***ūļ***anāga Mahā*** ***Thero***. 

Above words were carried and asked to ***Tipiṭaka C***ūļā***bhaya Mahā*** ***Thero*** again and then that ***Mahā*** ***Thero*** said as follows .\_\_\_\_ 

"Ā*vuso*… for the person with fundamental absorption, I would like to say this word, individual preferential absorption predetermines significance and differences in numbers of factors of enlightenment, Path, Absorption at the Noble Path (-moment)" said by venerable  ***C***ūļā***bhaya Mahā*** ***Thero.*** 

**PAGE 414** 

Furthermore \_\_\_\_ As individual preferential absorption predetermines significance and differences in numbers of factors of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption at the Noble Path (- moment) for the person with fundamental absorption, similarly\_\_\_ it should be understood for the  person  with  mastered  absorption.  It  is  right.\_\_\_\_  The  Noble  Path  which  arises  in  the continuum of person who discerns the first absorption etc., as the object of ***vipassanā*** practice, after emerging from the fifth absorption which is performed as the fundamental absorption of ***vipassanā*** practice, will associate with the fifth absorption, in accordance with the opinion of the first ***Mahā*** ***Thero*** while it will associate with the absorption which is performing as object of  ***vipassanā***  practice,  the  first  absorption  etc.,  (at  the  moment  of  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge Leading to Emerging), in accordance with the opinion of the second ***Mahā*** ***Thero***. Therefore, those  two  kinds  of  opinions,  opinion  of  fundamental  absorption,  and  opinion  of  masered absorption would be opposite to each other. In accordance with the opinion of the third ***Mahā*** ***Thero***, on the other hand, among those kinds of absorptions, such such kind of absorption is preferred, resulting in associating with that preferable absorption. Therefore those kinds of opinions, opinion of fundamental absorption and opinion of mastered absorption, are also not opposite to opinion of the third one, individual preferential absorption appropriately. Individual preferential absorption is also beneficial. It should be recognized in this way. (***Abhi-A-1-274***) 

Although fundamental absorption is the fifth absorption, the mastered absorption is the first absorption, and then in accordance with the opinion of fundamental absorption, the Path will  be  similar  to  the  fifth  absorption,  but  in  accordance  with  the  opinion  of  mastered absorption, the Path will be similar to the first absorption. In this way, while two opinions are contrary to each other, if individual preference weighs in order to occur the Noble Path which associates with the fifth absorption, only the Path associating with fifth absorption will arise and then if individual preference weighs in order to occur the Noble Path which associates with the first absorption, only the Path associating with first absorption will arise consequently. This is  because\_\_\_\_  at  the  moment  of  ***Vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to  Emerging,  only  the absorption  which  conforms  individual  preference  is  discerned  as  the  object  of  ***vipassanā*** practice  continuously.  It  means  that  due  to  addition  of  opinion  of  individual  preferential absorption, two opposite opinions are not contradictory to each other. Thus in the absence of opinion of individual preferential absorption, previous two opinions can be contradictory to each other and when opinion of individual preferential absorption is added, any opinion with the help of opinion of individual preferential absorption  will be complete and better than remaining  one,  resulting  in  advantage  of  individual  preference.  Due  to  this  reason  the commentary (***Abhi-A-1.-274***) explained this third opinion as an essential one. (see ***Mūla***ṭī***-1- 116)***) 

In this way those three ***Mahā*** ***Theras*** were actually naturalists who know ultimate nature with causes and results. Those ***Mahā*** ***Theras*** were sharp wisdom persons and their opinions were submitted in commentary by olden commentators. In this commentary called ***Aṭṭhasālin***ī, it would be presented the abstract  meaning of those opinions and these three opinions (= three kinds of absorptions referring in three opinions) are conformed by ***vipassanā Knowledge Leading to Emerging appropriately. 

***(Abhi-A*-1-274)** 

It  is  right.  \_\_\_  Only  when  those  various  opinions  occur  together  with  ***vipassanā*** practice, the accomplishment of meaning saying in those opinion will be finished well. In the presence of fundamental absorption only, in the presence of individual preference only, the function of accomplishment of Noble Path can not be achieved without ***vipassanā*** practice. Due to accomplishment in the presence of ***vipassanā*** practice only, it means that it is worth showing  as  "***vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to  Emerging  predetermines  significance  and differences in numbers of factors of Enlightenment, Path, Absorption at the Noble Path (- moment). (***M***uuuu***la***tttt***i***-1-117)  

**Page 415**  

31. ***Four kinds of pa***tttt***ipad***aaaa (way of practice) 

Now it will be continued to present significance and differences of  way of practice (***pa***tttt***ipad***aaaa))))      at the Noble Path (-moment) as follows: 

1.When defilements are removed at the beginning stage, if this Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations (*sa*v*kh*a*rupekkh*aban*a*) performs its function with stress and prepared mind called *cittapayoga*, this way of practice has got desigination as ***dukkhapa***tttt***ipad***aaaa (strait way of practice). 

2. If the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations is able to perform its function without stress and prepared mind, the way of practice has got desigination as ***sukhapa***tttt***ipad***aaaa    (easy way of practice). 
2. After removing defilments, due to inability to approach to the desirable situation called the Noble Path, when *vipassan*a practice is performed continuously, if this Knowledge of 

Neutrality Towards Formations is retarded to arise the Noble Path, it has got designation as ***dandh***aaaa***bhi***bbbbbbbbaaaa (retarded enlightenment). 

4. In reversely, this Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations which performs rapidly to arise the Noble Path has got designation as ***khipp***aaaa***bhi***bbbbbbbbaaaa    (rapid enlightenment). 

Thus this Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations lies as the factor of arising of the 

Noble Path and it gives rise to occour designations, such as ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** etc., for 

respective Noble Path.  

The  Noble  Path  has,  therefore,  got  four  kinds  of  desiginations,  ***dukkhapaṭipadā  etc, respectively. (Vs-2-306) 

***7.31.A Pondering found  in commentary of Aṭṭhasālinī 

It  will  be  continued  to  present  about  the  occurrence  of  ***dukkhapaṭipadā***,  found  in commentary of ***Abhidhamma*** **(Abhi-A-1-260,261)** as follows. \_\_\_ 

It  should  be  recognized  on  discision  of  these  words,  ***dukkhapaṭipadam dandhābhiññam*** etc, in this way. When defilements are removed at the beginning stage, a meditator is very stressful to remove defilements with prepared mind called ***citta payoga*** and various circumstances, resulting in various kinds of difficulty to remove defilements. The way of practice of that person is actually ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** (= strait way of practice). Furthermore, after  removing  defilements,  when  ***vipassanā  practice  is  performed,  a  meditator  reaches  to apparent arising of the Noble Path for long time. The enlightenment of that person, actually, ***is dandhābhiññā*** (= retarded enlightenment). Thus olden noble teachers defined any kind of such interval  (***vāra***)  as  ***dukkhapaṭipadā***  ***dandhābhiññā***  (=  strait  way  of  practice  with  retarded enlightenment). **(*Abhi-A*-1-260)** 

**PAGE 416** 

With  regarding  to  the  word,  ***yo  koci  vāro  =***  any  kind  of  such  intervals  (***vāra***),  of  the commentary,  any  kind  of  such  intervals  to  remove  defilements  by  means  of  efficiency  of practice, the interval with one time, the interval with two times, the interval with three times, the interval with four times, the interval with many times, is designated as ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** ***dandhābhiññā***, defined by olden teachers. **(*Mūla***ṭī* **–1-111)** 

**7.31.B the interval (*vāra)* agreed by commentator sayadaw** 

Among those intervals, which kind of interval agreed by commentators is that \_\_\_ for such interval, those defilements which are removed by the first attempt are reappeared again and those are removed by the second attempt again. Those defilements which are removed by second attempt are also reappeared again. However, defilements which are removed by the third attempt are eradicated by the Noble Path successively. This interval is agreed by the commentatorts, resulting in designating as ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** ***dandhābhiññā*** (= strait way of practice with retarded enlightenment). **(*Abhi-A*-1-260)** 

This  interval  with  three  times  to  remove  defilements  is  agreed  by  commentator  to designate  as  "  ***dukkhapaṭipadā***  ".  Those  interval  with  more  than  three  times  to  remove defilements are no need to say as ***dukkhapaṭipad***ā. It means that the interval, which can arise the  Noble  Path  through  only  one  or  two  times  to  remove  defilements,  is  designated  as  " ***sukhapaṭipadā***" (= easy way of practice). If the commentators agreed the interval with three times to remove defilements as ***dukkhapaṭipadā***, it should be understood those intervals with more  than  three  times  to  remove  defilements,  four  times  etc,  are  no  need  to  say  as ***dukkhapaṭipadā***, anymore. **(*Mūla***ṭī* **–1-111-112)** 

It will be continued to be explicit. \_\_\_ It can not be clear understood easily even though this length of explanation has been presented. Therefore, it should be recognized these words, ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** ***dandhābhiññā*** etc, as the following way of explanation to be explicit at the beginning step. \_\_\_ 

1. ***The first interval*** \_ ***rūpārūpapariggahavāra*** 

After  keeping  in  mind  four  great  elements  by  means  of  characteristic,  function, manifestation, proximate cause, the practising meditator keeps in mind (24) kinds of derived corporealities  by  means  of  similar  way.  Mental  ***dhammas***  are  kept  in  mind  by  means  of characteristic, function, manifiestation, proximate cause. When corporeality and mentality are kept in mind it is able to perform through stressfulness and difficulty. The way of practice of that  person  is  called  ***dukkhapaṭipadā***  (=  strait  way  of  practice).  Furthermore,  when  the meditator  with  the  Knowledge  of  Analysing  Mentality-Corporeality  performs  ***vipassanā*** practice, due to retardation of occurrence of the Noble Path, it is called ***dandhābhiññā*** (= retarded enlightenment). **(*Abhi – A* –1-260,** ***Mūla***ṭī* **–1-112)**  

**PAGE 417** 

In  this  case,  these  words,  (a)  keeping  in  mind  corporeality  (b)  keeping  in  mind mentality (c) keeping in mind corporeality and mentality, mean analyzing on corporeal and mental **dhammas** by means of characteristic, function, manifestation, proximate cause. When the function of analysis is performed in that way, it faces with stressfulness and difficulty, it is called  strait  way  of  practice  (***dukkhapaṭipad***ā).  Even  though  it  is  easy  to  keep  in  mind corporeal ***dhamma***, if mental ***dhammas*** are difficult to be kept in mind, it is called strait way of practice. Thus if any stage of practice is stressful and difficult to be kept in mind, it should be recognized the fact that it can be designated as ***dukkhapaṭipad***ā. 

2. ***The second interval –*** ***nāmārūpavavatthāpanavāra*** 

***Pāli- Quotation (Mūla***ṭī* **–1-112)** 

- Distinguishing and keeping in mind in a way that "it is only mentality-corporeality;  

there is no person, being, living being, human being, heavenly being, brahma etc, other than mentality-corporeality",  is  called ***nāmarūpavavatthāpana***.  It  is  the  stage  of  purification  of views (***diṭṭhivisuddhi***). ***(Mūla***ṭī **–1-112)** 

After  analyzing  corporeality-mentality  (either  it  may  be  easy  or  difficult  way  of practice), when a such meditator distinguishes and keeps in mind mentality and corporeality, it is accomplished with stressfulness and difficulty. Afterward, ***vipassanā*** practice is performed and it is able to arise the Path-Knowledge through taking for a long time. The way of practice and enlightenment of that person is also designated as ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** ***dandhābhiññ***ā. ***(Abhi- A*-1-260)** 

After the Knowledge of Analysing Corporeality-Mentality occurs with strait way of practice,  the  Knowledge  of  Discriminating  on  Mentality-Corporeality (***nāmarūpavavatthāpana***) etc, can be accomplished with easy way of practice due to presence of weak defilements. Although it can be occurred as easy way of practice, if the person has weak controlling faculties called faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom, the obvious occurrence  of  Noble  Path  will  be  retarded.  Thus  accomplishment  of  the  Knowledge  of Discriminating on Mentality-Corporeality etc, with stressfulness and difficulty are not definite and significant factors of retardation of arising of the Noble Path. Due to only occurrence of weakness of controlling faculties, faith etc, which are associating with ***Vipassanā*** knowledge, is definite and significant factors of retardation of arising of the Noble Path, the commentary explained  the  occurrence  of  the  Knowledge  of  Analysing  Corporeality-Mentality  with stressfulness and difficulty is worth designating as ***dukkhapaṭipadā***, without putting strait way of practice to accomplish the Knowledge of Discriminating Mentality-Corporeality etc, in the first interval, ***rūpārūpapariggahavāra.*** 

It should be recognized how strait way of practice (***dukkhapaṭipad***ā) can be designated in these intervals (***vāra***), viz, **PAGE 418** 

1. ***nāmarūpavavatthāpana =*** distinguishing and keeping in mind mentality-corporeality 
1. ***paccayapariggaha =*** keeping in mind causal ***dhammas*** 
1. ***lakkhanapaṭivedha =*** penetrative knowing on three general characters, 
1. ***nikanṭipariyādāna =*** finishing off pleasingness on light (***obhāsa***) etc, respectively, as similar to ***rūpārūpapariggahavāra.***  

If the first interval, ***rūpārūpapariggahavāra*** is added, there are totally (5) intervals (***vāra***) in the field of ***dukkhapaṭipad***ā. Among those (5) intervals, if it is stressful and difficult at any interval, it should be recognized as ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** (= strait way of practice). **(see on** ***Mūla***ṭī **–1-112)** 

3. **The third interval – *paccayapariggahavāra*** 

After  distinguishing  and  keeping  in  mind  mentality  and  corporeality,  an  other practising  person  distinguishes  and  keeps  in  mind  causal  ***dhammas***  of  mentality  and corporeality, with stressfulness and difficulty. [By saying this stage, section of Knowledge of Discerning  Cause  and  Condition  (***paccayapariggahañ***aaaannnn***a***)  is  shown.  This  is  the  stage  of Purification by Overcoming Doubts (***kankhāvitara***nnnn***avisuddhi***).] Afterwards, when ***vipassanā*** practice is performed, it takes a long time to arise the Noble Path-knowledge, resulting in designating as ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** ***dandhābhiññ***ā. **(*Abhi-A*-1-260)** 

4. **The fourth interval – *lakkha***ṇ***apativedhavāra*** 

After  distinguishing  and  keeping  in  mind  causal  ***dhammas***  of  mentality  and corporeality,  an  other  practising  person  knows  penetratively  general  characters  with stressfulness and difficulty. [By saying this stage, the Knowledge of Comprehension called ***lakkha***ṇ***asammasana***  (=  mastery  on  general  characters)  is  shown.]  Afterwards,  when ***vipassanā***  practice  is  performed,  it  takes  a  long  time  to  arise  the  Noble  Path-Knowledge, resulting in designating as ***dukkha*** ***paṭipadā*** ***dandhābhññā. (Abhi-A-1-261)*** 

5. **The fifth interval-*nikantipariyādānavāra*** 

After knowing on three general characters penetratively, an other practising person performs ***vipassanā*** practice with the knowledge which is  

1) ***tikkha*** = very sharp, 
1) ***sūra*** =*** very brave, 
1) ***pasanna*** = very clear, 

and  when  he  discerns  on  pleasingness  on  ***vipassanā  practice,  light  etc.,  it  is  very stressful  and  difficult  to  keep  in  mind  those  ***vipassanānikanti***.  It  will  be  continued  to  be explicit. \_\_\_ After finishing off pleasingness on ***vipassanā*** practice which is attachment on impurities of ***vipassanā***, light etc, when ***vipassanā*** practice is performed, it takes a long time to arise the Noble Path-Knowledge, resulting in designating as ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** ***dandhābhiññā.*** **PAGE-419** 

This  interval  (***vāra***)  is  satisfied  and  agreed  by  exegete  Sayadaw  to  designated  as ***dukkha*** ***paṭipadā*** ***dandhābhññ***ā. It is worth designating as ***dukkha*** ***paṭipadā*** ***dandhābhññā.*** It should be recognized obvious showing from the beginning in this way. It should be understood coming names, ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** ***khippābhiññā, sukhapaṭipadā*** ***dandhābhññā, sukhapaṭipadā*** ***kkhippabhiññā  in similar way. **(*Abhi-A*-1-261)** 

**7.31.C The interval (*vāra*) agreed by commentator sayadaws** 

At the end of Knowledge of Comprehension (***kalāpasammasanañāna***) called interval of penetrative knowing on three general characters (***lakkhanapaṭivedhavāra***), the Knowledge of  Arising  and  Passing  Away,  which  knows  and  sees  the  arising  and  passing  away  of conditioned things up to momentary present (***khanapaccuppanna***), occurs consequently. At that stage of Knowledge of Arising and Passing away, defilement ***dhammas*** of ***vipassanā*** practice (***upakkilesa***), light etc, which are causes of impurity of ***vipassanā***, occur obviously. Commentator  sayadaws  agreed  the  interval  with  three  times  of  attempts  to  remove  those defilement ***dhammas***, as ***dukkhapaṭipad***ā. This is because the field of way of practice has the terminal demarcation as this ***nikantipariyādānavāra***. 

Although it is very easy to perform overcoming to ***nikantipariyādānavāra*** in which defilement  ***dhammas***  of  ***vipassanā  practice  are  removed,  if  previous  intervals, ***rūpārūpapariggahavāra***  etc,  are  difficult  and  stressful  to  be  accomplished,  it  should  be recognized  the  fact  that  it  is  not  worth  rejecting  to  designate  on  those  intervals  as ***dukkhapaṭipadā***, due to presence of way of designation shown in the commentary. **(*Mūla***ṭī* **–1- 112)** 

In the next method \_\_\_ In this phrase, "***imam vāram rocesum*** = this interval is satisfied and agreed", the words, this interval, mean not only the last interval, ***nikantipariyādānavāra***, but also all kinds of intervals from the beginning of first interval, through which it is stressful and  difficult  to  remove  defilements  for  three  times  of  attempt  respectively.  It  means  all intervals  with  three  times  of  attempt  to  remove  defilements,  are  worth  designating  as ***dukkhapaṭipad***ā. 

In the continuum of such practising person, after removing defilements through only once attempt for all five intervals, if the Noble Path is reached quickly by rapid advancement of ***vipassanā Knowledge, those all kinds of knowledge, ***rūpārūpapariggahāñāna***, etc, are not stressful and difficult to be accomplished for that practsing person. It should be recognized that person's way of practice as ***sukhapaṭipadā*** (easy way of practice). **(*Mūla***ṭī **–1-112)**  

7.31.D Consideration of ***Mahāṭīkā*** ***Sayadaw*** 

It is right for the explanation performed by the Noble teacher called ***Mūla***ṭī***k***ā* Sayadaw, that  "commentator  Sayadaws  agreed  and  satisfied  the  designation  on  each  interval  with stressfulness and difficulty to remove defilement ***dhammas*** of ***vipassanā*** practice for three times of attempts as ***dukkha patipadā***, respectively." However, 

PAGE 420 

It is explained in the commentary called ***Aṭṭhasā*** ***linī*** **(261)** as follows. \_\_\_ 

**Pali Quotation (Abhi – A – 1 – 261)** 

When  ***Vipassanā  knowledge  can  perform  it's  function  with  sharp,  brave  and  clear efficiency, pleasingness on ***vipassanā*** practice (***vipassanā*** ***nikanti***) which has heartfelt desire on the light  etc., occurring in the continuum of himself, occurs consequently,  resulting in  stressfulness and difficulty to discern  and finish of f those defilements. **(*Abhi-A*-1-261)** 

Due to presence of explanation in this way, it should be recognized the fact that before this "***vipassanā*** knowledge leading to emerging", if that Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations, which occurs through the Knowledge of Desire for Deliverance etc, also removes opposite  ***dhammas***  with  stressfulness  and  difficulty,  it  stands  on  strait  way  of  practice, ***dukkhapaṭipad***ā. Those teachers of other school of thought (***keciācariya***) had the opinion that "due to occurrence of the same knowledge between the Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away and this Knowledge of Neutrality towards Formations, it is explained commonly as a single  stage  by  means  of  unique  method  (***ekattanaya***)  in  the  section  of  way  of  practice (***paṭipad***ā) in the commentary called ***Visuddhi Magga"***. (see four kinds of ways of practice found in ***Visuddhi Magga***, which has been presented previously.) 

**(*Mah***aaaaṭī **– 2 – 476)** 

**7.13.D Difference and similarity of ways of practices** 

Those ways of practices (***paṭipad***aaaa) are varied in some *bhikkhus*, while both all four kinds of the Noble Path are unique for some *bhikkhus*. Especially \_\_\_ for the Buddhas all four kinds of Noble Path were only single way of practice, ***sukhapaṭipad***aaaa ***khippābhiññ***aaaa (easy way of  practice  with  rapid  enlightenment).  Similarly  all  four  kinds  of  Noble  Path  of  the  most Venerable ***S***aaaa***riputta*** were also single way of practice called ***sukkhapaṭipadā*** ***khippābhiññā***, similarly. Then the Noble Path of upstream-enterer of the most venerable ***Moggall***aaaa***na***, was ***sukhapaṭipad***aaaa ***khipp***aaaa***bhiññ***aaaa***,*** while the Upper Three kinds of Noble Path were only single way of practice, ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** ***dandhābhiññ***ā. **(Vs- 2- 307)** 

In the commentary called ***Aṭṭhasālin***ī, however, it is explained as follows. \_\_\_ 

The Upper Three Kinds of Noble Path of the most venerable ***Moggallāna***, were only single way of practice, ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** ***khippābhiññ***ā. This is because the Noble one was suppressed by drowsiness. The Supreme Enlightened Buddha performed in order to arise the Noble Path and Fruit of Venerable ***Moggallāna*** throughout seven days as taking care of a boy. In the first day after new moon day, 11th month, Great Buddhist Era 103, the Most Venerable ***Moggallāna*** reached to the Noble Fruit-Knowledge of Upstream-enterer by listening a verse of ***dhamma***,  "***ye  dhammā***  ***hetuppabhavā***"..etc.,  from  great  ascetic  called  ***Upatissa***  who  will become the Most Venerable ***Sāriputta***, who had also reached to the Noble Fruit-Knowledge of Upstream-enterer by listening an half of that verse of ***dhamma*** from the Arahant, the most venerable ***Assaji Mahā*** ***Thero***. After becoming as *bhikkhu* at that evening, the Most Venerable ***Moggallāna***  continued  to  perform  ***vipassanā  practice  in  ***Kallav***āļ***aputta***village,  ***Magadha*** Division. **PAGE 421** 

At seventh day, during endeavouring ***vipassanā*** practice, Venerable ***Moggallāna*** was sitting with  drowsiness.  At  that  time,  the  Buddha  questioned  him  that  "***Moggallāna!***  Are  you drowsing? ***Moggallāna!*** Are you drowsing? Due to suppressing with drowsiness in that way, the Upper Three Kinds of Noble Path of Venerable ***Moggallāna*** were a single way of practice, ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** ***khippābhiññ***ā. After removing drowsiness by developing the perception of light as instructed by the Buddha, due to reaching into upper Three Kinds of Path and Fruit rapidly, he became the person with rapid Enlightenment (***khippābhiññ***ā). 

Even though the supreme disciple with great wisdom (***mahābhiññappatta***) had this kind of nature, the way of practice was unstable, changed and varied. Why ways of practice of the remaining persons cannot be unstable, changed and varied? It  will be unstable, changed and varied really.  

1. All  four  kinds  of  Noble  Path  of  some  *bhikkhu*  are  a  single  way  of  practice, ***dukkhapatiṭpadā*** ***dandhābhiññā.*** 
2. All  four  kinds  of  Noble  Path  of  some  *bhikkhu*  are  a  single  way  of  practice, ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** ***khippābhiññā.*** 
2. All  four  kinds  of  Noble  Path  of  some  *bhikkhu*  are  a  single  way  of  practice, ***sukhapa***tttt***ipadā*** ***dandhābhiññā.*** 
2. All  four  kinds  of  Noble  Path  of  some  *bhikkhu*  are  a  single  way  of  practice, ***sukhapaṭipadā*** ***khippābhiññā*** 
2. The first Noble Path of such *bhikkhu* is the way of practice called ***dukkhapaṭipadā*** ***dandhābhiññā***  while  the  Second  Noble  Path,  ***dukkhapaṭpadā***  ***khippābhiññā***  ;  the Third  Noble  Path,  ***sukhapaṭipadā***  ***dandhābhiññ***ā;  the  Fourth  Noble  Path, ***sukhapaṭipadā*** ***khippābhiññ***ā. 

It  should  be  recognized  the  Knowledge  of  Neutrality  Towards  Formations  determines significance and difference of ways of practice in this way. **(Abhi – A – 1 – 280)** 

As the way of practice is unstable and varied, the supremacy (***adhipati***) is also unstable and  varied.  All  four  kinds  of  Noble  Path  of  some  *bhikkhus*  are  accomplished  through supremacy of wish (***chandādhipateyya***). All four kinds of Noble Path of some *bhikkhus* are accomplished through supremacy of effort (***viriyādhipateyya***). All four kinds of Noble Path of some *bhikkhus* are accomplished through supremacy of consciousness (***cittādhipateyya***). All four  kinds  of  Noble  Path  of  some  *bhikkhus*  areaccomplished  through  supremacy  of investigation (***vīmamsādhipateyya***). **(*Abhi – A* – 1 – 280)** 

Furthermore,  the  first  Noble  Path  of  some  *bhikkhu*  is  accomplished  through  the supremacy called wish, while the second Noble Path through the supremacy called effort, the Third Noble Path through the supremacy called consciousness, the Fourth Noble Path through the supremacy called investigation. Thus four kinds of Noble Path of some *bhikkhus* have significant and different kinds of supremacy called ***adhipati***. It should be recognized there is a single supremacy in all four kinds of Noble Path of some practising bhikkhus. PAGE 422 

In this way, the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations determines significance and difference of ways of practice. The fact, "it determines significance and difference of emancipation (***vimokkha***)", has been mentioned previously. **(*Abhi – A* – 1 – 280, *Vs* – 2 – 307)** 

32. **The next method \_\_\_ How the names are available for the Noble Path** 

If  it  will  be  explained  in  detail  with  the  next method  \_\_\_  the  Noble  Path  has  got different names due to these (5) kinds of factors \_\_\_ 

1. ***sarasa*** = through it’s nature, 
1. ***paccanīka*** = through opposite occurrence, 
1. ***sagu***ṇ***a*** = through it's qualities, 
1. ***āramma***ṇ***a*** = through object, 
1. ***āgamana*** = through ***vipassanā*** practice, respectively. 

It will be explicit. +\_\_\_ 

1. ***sarasa*** \_\_\_ If the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations emerges from ***nimitta*** (=phenomenon  of  conditioned  things)  through  discerning  on  all  conditioned  things occurring in three realms ***as anicca***, the Noble Path will emancipate through ***animitta vimokkha*** (= emancipation by realizing on vuidness of phenomenon of conditioned things). If it emerges from ***nimitta*** through discerning as ***dukkha***, the Noble Path will emancipate through ***appa***nnnn***ihita vimokkha*** (= emancipation by realizing on the object of ***nibbāna***). If it emerges from ***nimitta*** through discerning as ***anatta***, the Noble Path will emancipate through ***suññata vimokkha***(= emancipation by realizing on voidness or nothingness  of  self  (***atta***)).  These  three  names,  ***animitta,  appa***ṇ***ihita,  suññata,***  are accomplished through its nature (***sarasa***). **(*Vs*-2-307)** 

**Pali- Quotation  (*Mah***aaaaṭī* **– 2 – 477)** 

It  is  a  reasonable  question  that  "isn't  the  Noble  Path  only  designated  as  Emerging (***vuṭṭhāna***)?" The answer is as follows \_\_\_ The ***dhamma*** which is capable of emerging from ***nimitta***  and  ***pavatta***,  that  is  called  the  subject  of  verb,  emerge,  is  the  Noble  Path.  The fundamental  factor  of  that  Noble  Path  is,  actually,  the  Knowledge  of  Neutrality  Towards Formations. [It should be recognized as significant method (***padhānanaya***) for emphasis on the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations only.]  It should be recognized the fact that the commentator explained by metaphorical usage called ***phalūpacāra***. In the next method \_\_\_ in above commentary, showing on the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards  Formations only is achieved through metaphorical usage called ***upalakkha***ṇ***anaya, nidassana naya*** (= significant character  is  shown).  It  should  be  interpreted  on  all  ***vipassanā***  Knowledge  Leading  to Emerging. The Knowledge of Translineage belonging to that ***vipassanā*** Knowledge Leading to Emerging also emerges from phenomenon of conditioned things. Due to the same occurrence as  Knowledge  of  ***vipassanā***,  the  Knowledge  of  Neutrality  Towards  Formations  and  the Knowledge  of  Trans-lineage  are,  therefore,  taking  commonly  through  the  unique  method (***ekattanaya***), and then the commentary explained that the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations emerges from phenomenon of conditioned things by discerning as ***anicca, dukkha, anatta.* (*Mah***aaaaṭī **– 2 – 477)** PAGE 423 [Notes: \_\_\_ As translation is performed in mentioned above, by considering the meaning of the word, ***tvā***, found in ***sammasitvā*** as the meaning of cause (***hetu***), if it is interpreted directly that "if the Noble Path emerges from ***nimitta*** and ***pavatta***, due to discerning on conditioned things as ***anicca (dukkha, anatta)***, it is no need to consider these metaphorical usage, ***phalūpacāra*** and ***ekatta*** method again. It must be recognized in this way.] 

2. ***paccanīka \_\_\_*** That Path, which is worth designating as ***magga***, due to the same occurrence of Path, ***pubbabhāgasaṭipaṭṭhāna magga*** and ***ariyamagga*** are taking as unique through the ***ekattanaya***, breaks down each kind of compactness, compactness of continuity, compactness of form, compactness of function, compactness of object, of conditioned things by the help of Knowledge of Contemplation on Impermanence and it appears by abandoning ***nicca nimitta*** (= emblem of permanence), ***dhuva nimitta*** (= emblem of durability), ***sassata nimitta*** (= emblem of eternity). Therefore that Path is designated as ***animitta***. 

Then due to occurrence of appearance by drying up the heartfelt desire on conditioned things called ***pa***nnnn***idhi*** after abandoning perception of happiness through the Knowledge of Contemplation of Suffering, that Path is designated as ***appa***ṇ***ihita***. 

Due to deserving to see the occurrence of voidness of ***atta, satta, puggala*** (self, being, person), of conditioned things after abandoning perception called ***atta, satta, puggala***, through the Knowledge of Contemplation of Nonself, that Path is designated as ***suññata***. Therefore, these three names, ***animitta,appanihita, suññata***, are achieved through opposite occurrence (***paccanīka***). (***Vs-2-307; Mahāṭī-2-477***) 

3. ***Sagu***ṇ***a*** \_\_\_\_ Furthermore, due to lack of passion etc., due to voidness of passion etc., at the Noble Path (-moment), resulting in voidness of passion etc., that Path is designated as ***suññata***. Due to lack of sign of corporeality, sign of feeling etc., which are worth obsessing as "mine", the next method \_\_\_\_ due to lack of sign of passion, sign of anger, sign of delusion, the next method \_\_\_\_  due to lack of phenomenon of conditioned things, which can be thought as form and shape, it is designated as ***animitta***. Due to lack of heartfelt desire of passion, heartfelt desire of anger, heartfelt desire of delusion, it is designated as ***appa***ṇ***ihita***. Therefore, these three names, ***suññata, animitta, appa***ṇ***ihita***, are achieved through it's qualities. (***Vs-2-307, Mahāṭī-2-477***) 
3. ***āramma***ṇ***a*** \_\_\_\_ Due to voidness of both all kinds of conditioned things and self, ***nibbāna*** is designated as ***suññata***. Due to the Noble Path takes the object of ***nibb***aaaa***na*** which is called *su*bb*ata* as object, that Noble Path is worth designating as ***suññata***. Due to lack of all kinds of phenomena of conditioned things, ***nibbāna*** is designated as ***animitta***. Due to taking the object of ***nibbāna*** called ***animitta***, as object, that Noble Path is worth designating as ***animitta.*** Due to lack of heartfelt desire of craving (***ta***ṇ***hāpa***ṇ***idhi***) etc., ***nibbāna*** is designated as ***appa***ṇ***ihita.*** Due to taking the object of ***nibbāna*** called ***appa***ṇ***ihita***, as object, that Noble Path is worth designating as ***appa***ṇ***ihita***. Therefore, these three names, ***suññata, animitta, appa***ṇ***ihita,*** are achieved through object (***āramma***ṇ***a***). (***Vs-2-307, Mahāṭī-2-477,478***) 

**PAGE-424** 

5. ***āgamana***  \_\_\_\_  As  mentioned  previously,  there  are  two  kinds  of  traces  (***āgamana***), ***vipassanā*** ***gamana*** (trace of ***vipassanā***) and ***maggāgamana*** (trace of Path). In those two kinds, at the Noble Path (-moment), ***vipassanā*** ***gamana*** should be available, while at the Noble Fruit (-moment), ***maggāgamana*** should be available. It is right. \_\_\_ Due to deserving to discern the occurrence of voidness of self of conditioned things by ***anattānupassanā***, it is designated as ***suññata*** through it's nature. The Noble Path, which is resulted from ***suññata vipassanā***, is designated  as  ***suññata***  through  ***vipassanāgamana***.  Due  to  removing  emblem  of  eternity, ***aniccānupassanā***  is  designated  as  ***animitta***.  The  Noble  Path,  which  is  resulted  from ***animittavipassanā***,  is  designated  as ***animitta*** through ***vipassanāgamana***.  This  name  called ***animitta***  of  Noble  Path  should  not  be  available  by  means  of  preaching  methodology  of ***Abhidhamma*** but by that of ***suttanta*** only. It is right. \_\_\_ In that preaching methodology of ***suttanta***, after designating as ***animitta*** by taking the object of ***nibbāna*** called ***animitta***, the Knowledge of Trans-lineage gives the Noble Path the designation as ***animitta*** by standing on circum stance of ***vipassanā***  ***gamana paṭipadā*** (= trace of way of practice). In this way, it was said by olden noble teachers. The Noble Path is worth designating as ***animitta*** through the name given by that cause, ***vipassanā***. 

Furthermore,  the  words,  "The  Noble  Fruit  is  designated  as  ***animitta***  through ***maggāgamana***", are appropriate ones. Due to occurrence of coming up to the Noble Path by drying  up  the  heartfelt  desire  called  ***ta***ṇ***hā***  (=  craving)  on  conditioned  things, ***dukkhānupassanā  is  designated  as  ***appa***ṇ***ihita***.  The  Noble  Path,  which  is  resulted  from ***appa***ṇ***ihita vipassanā is designated as ***appa***ṇ***ihita***. The Noble Fruit of the Noble Path called ***appa***ṇ***ihita***, is designated as ***appa***ṇ***ihita ariyaphala***. In this way, ***vipassanā*** practice gives it's name, ***appa***ṇ***ihita***, to the Noble Path and then the Noble Path gives it's name, ***appa***ṇ***ihita***, to it's Noble Fruit successively. Therefore, this name called ***appa***ṇ***ihita*** is achieved through the trace (***āgamana***). Thus this Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations determines significance and difference of emancipation (***vimokkha***). **(Vs-2-307,308)** 

33. **Kind  of  *sa***nnnn***khārupekkhā***  **which  can  give  rise  to  *paṭisandhi*  (process  of  Newly Occurrence of Next Existence, NONE)** 

***Pāli* Quotation (*Paṭisam – 60)*** 

How the similarity between way of the mind directing towards ***sankhārupekkha*** of both worldling person and fulfilling person (***sekkha puggala***) can be occurred is that \_\_\_ the worldling person's mind which attaches on ***sankhārupekkha*** is faded; it is danger of ***vipassanā*** practice, resulting in danger of penetrative knowing on Four Noble Truths by the Noble Path. It will be the source of process of NONE (***paṭisandhi***) in future. 

**PAGE 425** 

The mind of fulfilling person, which attaches on ***sankhārupekkhā***, is also faded; it is danger of ***vipassanā*** practice, resulting in danger of penetrative knowing on Four Noble Truths by successive upper Path-Knowledge. It is the source of process of NONE (***paṭisandhi***) in future. Thus the similarity between way of the mind directing towards of ***sankhārupekkhā of both worlding person and fulfilling person can be occurred through the nature of attachment. ***(Paṭisam –60)*** 

***Pāli* Quotation (*Paṭisam –* A – 1 – 250)*** 

Due to occurrence of vigour of ***kamma*** called volition, which is associating with the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations of worldling person, when that ***kamma*** gives rise to process of NONE of joyful existence of sensual sphere, the defilement called selfish- desire (***lobha***) which can be said as attachment on ***saṅkhārupekkhā*** will be the source of process of NONE of joyful existence of sensual sphere in future. The volition (= ***kamma)*** associating with the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations, which is accompanied with defilement called selfish-desire, can give rise to consequence, the process of NONE of joyful existence  of  sensual  sphere  etc.  Therefore  the  volition  (=  ***kamma)***  associating  with  the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations is ***janaka*** (= direct) factor which can give rise consequence directly. The defilement called selfish-desire  which is capable of attaching on ***saṅkhārupekkhā***, is ***upatthambhaka*** (= supporting) factor which is able to support indirectly **…R …**  

Among fulfilling persons, when the *kamma* of ***saṅkhārupekkhā***  called the volition associating with the Knowledge Towards Formations of those Upstream enterers and Once - returnees  who  lack  absorption  the  defilement  called  selfish  desire  which  attaches  on ***saṅkhārupekkhā*** is the supporting factor (***upatthambhaka paccaya)*** of process of NONE of joyful existence of sensual sphere. Due to presence of the nature of acquiring the process of NONE of Fine-material Sphere  and  Immaterial Sphere only, the defilement called selfish- desire, which attaches on ***saṅkhārupekkhā,*** of the Upstream-enterer, Once-returnee, and Non- returnee  who  have  got  absorption,  is  unable  to  occur  as  ***upatthambhaka***  factor,  which  is capable of supporting indirectly for consequence of those processes of NONE of fine material and immaterial sphere. It should be recognized the fact that this defilement called selfish-desire which attaches ***saṅkhārupekkhā,*** only, is also supporting factor (***upatthmbhaka)***, which is capable of supporting indirectly for the process of NONE, which is resulting from ***kamma*** called the volition associating with the Knowledge of Adaptation and the Knowledge of Trans- lineage. (***Paṭisam-A-1-250***) 

**The fact to be noticed** \_\_\_\_ In this case, it should be noticed and recognized on both the fact that "wholesome volition, which is associating with the Knowledge of Adaptation, can give rise to a process of NONE (***Paṭisandhi***) of joyful existence of sensual sphere in future" and the fact that "wholesome volition, which is associating with the Knowledge of Trans-lineage also can give rise to a process of NONE (***Paṭisandhi***) of joyful existence of sensual sphere in future". 

**PAGE-426** 

Both  the  consciousness  of  Knowledge  of  Adaptation  and  the  consciousness  of Knowledge of Translineage arise only once. It is evidence for the fact, "a single volition can give rise to a new coming-into-existence". Similarly, it should be understood how the volition of Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations (***saṅkhārupekkhā*** ***kamma***) can give rise to consequence in that way. 

34. **The most important period** 

For a worldling person who runs along with infinite rounds of rebirth (***samsāra***), if he has  not  got  both  five  fold  misdeeds  towards  benefactors  with  infinite  indebtedness (***pañcānantariya kamma***), which can give rise to woeful existences certainly, and the volition with fixed wrong views (***niyatamicchādiṭṭhikamma***), which has not abandoned yet until die, in one side; if any kind of Lofty Volition (***mahaggata kamma***) called stable absorption untile die, which  can  give  rise  to  existences  of  fine  material  and  immaterial  spheres,  has  not  been acquired in him, in other side; if at least various kinds of ***vipassanā*** Knowledge, up to the Knowledge of Discerning Cause and Condition, has not been acquired in him, in other side; the period  which  is  adjacent  to  death  is  the  most  important  time  really.  For  those  worldling persons, if the impulsions of mind-door cognitive process adjacent to death (***mara***ṇ***asanna javana***) are unwholesome impulsions, any existence of woeful realms (***apāyabhūmi***) will be reached  certainly;  if  those  are  wholesome  impulsions,  any  existence  of  joyful  realms (***sugatibhūmi***) will be reached accordingly. Among those ***kammas*** (= volitions), this volition of the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formation is a supreme kind of ***kamma***. 

In  the  ***Sotānugata  Sutta***,  the  Buddha  preached  that  if  those  gentlemen  with  the Knowledge of Neutrality Towards Formations are persons who have no heartfelt desire on the attainment  of  the  Supreme  Enlightenment  (***sammāsambodhiñāṇa***),  the  Enlightenment  of ***pacceka  buddha***,  the  Enlightenment  of  Supreme  Disciple  (***aggasāvaka  bodhiñāṇa***),  the Enlightenment of Great Disciple (***mahāsāvaka bodhiñāṇa***), they are, generally, able to attain the Noble Path and Fruit, ***nibbāna***, in the second existence after death. Therefore, by the time very difficult human existence and buddhist monkhood are obtained, they should try hard to know Noble ***dhammas*** of the Buddha which have valid guarantee in that way, with two kinds of  understanding,  understanding  through  learning  (***āgamasuta***)  and  understanding  through practising (***adhigamasuta***). For those persons without end of rounds of rebirth, as mentioned above, the period which is adjacent to death is the most important time to separate between woeful and joyful existences. It is essential to fulfil wholesome deeds and volitions which can give rise to joyful existence certainly. If one has fulfilled to terminate the journey of rounds of rebirth,  it  is  great  conqueror  in  this  very  life  really.  Here  it  will  be  continued  to  present translation of ***Sotānugata sutta***. 

35. ***Sotānugata Sutta*** 

*Bhikkhus* … advantages, which are worth "expecting to be available surely, of noble ***dhammas***, which are distinguished and kept in audible knowledge (***ñāṇasota***) after falling into functional constituent of ear (***pasādasota***), which are learned by heart with the help of verbal endeavouring,  which  are  scrutinized  and  reasoned  over  and  over  again  by  mental endeavouring, which have been known and seen penetratively by the knowledge with right view on both basic meaning and causal ***dhammas***," are these four kinds indeed. 

**PAGE 427** 

Which are these four kinds? \_\_\_  

\1.  *Bhikkhus* … in this Noble Admonishment, a *bhikkhu* learns noble ***dhammas*** with these 

(9) kinds of classifications, viz,  

1. ***sutta*** = discourse called ***sutta***, 
1. ***geyya*** = discourse which is mixed with verse and prose, 
1. ***veyyākara***ṇ***a*** = discourse of pure prose without any verse, 
1. ***gāthā = discourse of verses, 
1. ***udāna*** = discourse of paean, 
1. ***itivuttaka***  =  discourse  which  is  introduced  in  a  way  that  "Thus  …  the  Buddha preached", 
1. ***jātaka*** = discourse relating to life stories of the Buddhas, 
1. ***abbhutadhamma*** = discourse relating to wonderful events which are unexperienced ones previously, 
1. ***vedalla***  =  discourse  consisting  of  questions  and  answers,  which  can  give  rise  to extraordinary knowledge and pleasingness, respetively. 

In the continuum of that *bhikkhu*, those kinds of discourses are distinguished and kept in audible knowledge after falling into functional constituent of ear; those are learned by heart with the help of verbal endeavouring; those are scrutinized and reasoned over and over again by mental endeavouring; those have been known and seen penetratively by the knowledge with right view on both basic meaning and causal ***dhammas***. (Ang-1-504,505) 

**[Notes  :  \_\_\_**  "***diṭṭhiyā***  ***suppaṭividdhā"ti  atthato  ca  kāra***ṇ***ato  ca  paññāya  suṭṭhu paṭividdhā*** ***paccakkham katā.*(Ang-A-2-364)** 

The basic meaning of ***dhammas*** of three ***pitaka***, which are consisting of (9) kinds of classification,  which  are  preached  by  the  Buddha,  is  only  (4)  Ultimate  ***dhammas***,  viz, consciousness, mental concomitants, corporeality and ***nibbāna***. The gentleman who wants to attain the Fourth Ultimate ***dhamma***, ***nibbāna***, has to endeavour in order to know penetratively on three basic meanings called mundane consciousness, mental concomitants, corporeality by experiential  knowledge  with  right  view,  firstly.  These  are  functions  of  the  Knowledge  of Analysing Mentality and Corporeality and the Knowledge of Discerning Cause and Condition, or full understanding on objects (***ñātapariññ***ā). This is called the preaching methodology of showing the beginning (***ādidīpakanaya***). Due to presence of three kinds of full understanding (***pariññ***ā) and it shows the beginning one, ***ñātapariñña***, it must be interpreted on both the middle one, ṭī***ranapariññā*** (=full unmderstanding on propagation of practice) and the last one, ***pahānapariññā***  (full  understanding  on  abandonment).  It  refers  to  develop  ***Vipassanā*** knowledge from the Knowledge of Analysing Mentality and Corporeality until the Knowledge of  Neutrality  Towards  Formations.  During  endeavouring  in  that  way,  firstly  those consciousness,  mental  concomitants,  corporeality,  have  to  be  learned  through  doctrinal obligation. It is called ***āgamasuta*** (understanding through learning). Afterwards it is essential to endeavour in order to know penetratively on those Ultimate ***dhamma*** up to the Knowledge of  Neutrality  Towards  Formations.  It  is  called  ***adhigamasuta***  (=  understanding  through practising). It should be recognized that it refers to the gentleman who has completed with both ***āgamasuta*** and ***adhigamasuta***, in that way.] 

PAGE 428 

If that *bhikkhu* passes away without mindfulness, he becomes any kind of existence of heavenly being randomly. (Ang – 1 – 505) 

**[Notes : \_\_\_ *Pāli* Quotation (*Ang – A* – 2 – 364)** 

- These words, "if that *bhikkhu* passes away without mindfulness", is not prteached 

with referring to "forgetfulness" on preachings of the Buddha. It is preached with referring to the death as worldling person. It is right. \_\_\_ It can be designated the death of worldling person as the death with forgetfulness. (*Ang – A* – 2 – 364)] 

In the continuum of that heavenly being with full of happiness, words of ***dhammas*** appear apparently. (All ***dhammas***, which had been memorized in previous life, which had been known and seen penetratively by experiential knowledge with right view, appear apparently as a shape reflecting on clear mirrior.) 

*Bhikkhus* … the occurrence of mindfulness  associating  with ***Vipassanā*** knowledge, which is capable of discerning following to ***dhamma***, may be retarded. Actually, that heavenly being can attain the Supreme ***dhamma*** called the Path, Fruit, ***nibbāna***, rapidly. *Bhikkhus* … this is the first advantage which is worth expecting to be available surely, of noble ***dhammas***, which are distinguished and kept in audible knowledge (***ñāṇasota***) after falling into functional constituent  of  ear  (***pasādasota***),  which  are  learned  by  heart  with  the  help  of  verbal endeavouring,  which  are  scrutinized  and  reasoned  over  and  over  again  by  mental endeavouring, which have been known and seen penetratively by the knowledge with right view on both basic meaning and causal ***dhammas***. (*Ang* – 1 – 505) 

2. *Bhikkhus* … in the next kind, the *bhikkhu* learns noble ***dhammas*** with (9) kinds of classifications,  viz,  ***sutta,  geyya,  veyyākara***ṇ***a,  gāthā,  udāna,  itivuttaka,  jātaka,  abbhuta dhamma,  vedalla***.  In  the  continuum  of  that  *bhikkhu*,  those  kinds  of  discourses  are distinguished and kept in audible knowledge after falling into functional constituent of ear; those are learned by heart with the help of verbal endeavouring; those are scrutinized and reasoned  over  and  over  again  by  mental  endeavouring;  those  have  been  known  and  seen penetratively by the knowledge with right view on both basic meaning and causal ***dhammas***. 

If that *bhikkhu* passes away without mindfulness, he becomes any kind of existence of heavenly being randomly. In the continuum of that heavenly being with full of happiness, words of ***dhammas*** have not appeared apparently. Actually a *bhikkhu* who has fulfilled with Super-psychic  power  and  learned  in  mastery  of  mind  completely  comes  and  preaches ***dhammas*** to audiences of heavenly beings. In the continuum of that heavenly being, a kind of idea that 

**PAGE-429**
